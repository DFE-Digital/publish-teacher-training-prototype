If you’re a training partner (non-accredited provider), we need to know who you work with to run your courses.

## Adding and deleting an accredited provider

You need to select which accredited provider ratifies a course before you can publish it. You’ll also need to write a short description about the accredited provider. It’s a good idea to ask the accredited provider to check this content and approve it.

Go to the ‘Accredited providers’ tab in your account to:

- add new accredited providers
- update descriptions
- remove accredited providers from your account (unpublished courses only)

You’ll be asked to specify which accredited provider you’re working with for each course before you can publish it.

If you want to give people at the accredited provider organisation access to your courses, you can [add them as a user](https://www.publish-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/how-to-use-this-service/add-and-remove-users).

## Changing your accredited provider

If the organisation you were working with is no longer an accredited provider, you’ll need to select a different provider before publishing any new courses. You’ll be prompted to do this when [publishing rolled over courses](https://www.publish-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/how-to-use-this-service/rolled-over-courses).

If you need to change an accredited provider for a course that has already been published on Find, contact us at becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk.
