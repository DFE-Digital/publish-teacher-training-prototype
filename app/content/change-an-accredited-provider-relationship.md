title: Change an accredited provider relationship

---

If you're a training partner (non-accredited provider), we need to know who you work with to run your courses.

## Adding and deleting an accredited provider

You need to select which accredited provider ratifies a course before you can publish it. You'll also need to write a short description about the accredited provider. This can be written by you or in collaboration with the accredited provider.

Go to the 'Accredited providers' tab in your account to:

- add new accredited providers
- update descriptions
- remove accredited providers from your account (unpublished courses only)

You'll be asked to specify which accredited provider you're working with for each course before you can publish it.

## Changing your accredited provider

If the organisation you were working with is no longer an accredited provider, you'll need to select a different provider before publishing any new courses. You'll be prompted to do this when publishing a course.

You cannot change an accredited provider for a course which has already been published. If you need to change an accredited provider for a published course, contact us at becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk.
