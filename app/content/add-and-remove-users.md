Once an [organisation has been added to Publish](https://www.publish-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/how-to-use-this-service/add-an-organisation), any user can add other users. This means that more people can have access to the organisation's courses to view and manage them.

It might also be useful if you’re a training partner and want to give your accredited provider access.

To add a new user, they must already have a [DfE Sign-in account](https://services.signin.education.gov.uk). You can then add the user to your organisation.

## Adding a user

To add a user:

- go to the ‘Users’ tab
- select ‘Add user’
- enter the user’s details - the email address must match the user’s DfE Sign-in account

The user will be sent an email to let them know they’ve been added to the organisation.

## Removing a user

To remove a user:

- go to the ‘Users’ tab
- select the name of the user you want to remove from the alphabetically ordered list
- select ‘Remove user’

The user will be sent an email to let them know they’ve been removed from the organisation.
