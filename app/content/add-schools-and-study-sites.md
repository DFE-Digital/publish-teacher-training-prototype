We know from our research with candidates that understanding where their initial teacher training (ITT) will take place is one of the most important factors when choosing a course.

Over 80% of course searches on Find postgraduate teacher training (Find) are done by location, so it’s important that all location details have been added so courses can be found easily in searches.

To be able to publish a course, you’ll need to attach at least one school and at least one study site to it.

You can add all potential schools and study sites to your account in Publish teacher training courses (Publish) and then link them to a course.

## Adding a school

 To add details about a school, go to the ‘Schools’ tab.



Once you’ve entered the details, check they are correct and select ‘Add school’.

You’ll see a list of all schools you’ve added, and you’ll be able to select the name of the school to edit or remove it.

> You will not be able to remove a school if it has been attached to a course. You’ll need to detach it from the course first before you can remove it.

If you are concerned about the time taken to add this information, especially if your organisation works with many placement schools, please email us at becomingateacher@education.digital.gov.uk and we can add the information for you.



## Adding a study site

 A study site is the location where the trainee will do the theoretical part of their training, for example, a university campus.

You’ll need at least one study site attached to a course to be able to publish it, but you can add as many as you like.

To add study sites, go to the study site tab.



Once you’ve entered the details, check they are correct and select ‘Add study site’.

> You will not be able to remove a study site if it has been attached to a course. You’ll need to detach it from the course first before you can remove it.

## Attaching schools and study sites to a course

Once you’ve added schools and study sites to your account, you can attach them to a course. Candidates will then be able to see a list of the school placements and study sites on the course page on Find.

### When adding a new course

When you add a new course, you’ll be asked to select all the school placements and study sites that apply.







### When editing an existing course

Go to the ‘Basic details’ tab and select the ‘Change’ link next to ‘School placements’ or ‘Study sites’.



On the next page, you can then tick the check box next to the school or study site you want to attach to the course.

## Detaching schools and study sites from a course

If you want to detach a school or study site from a course, you can select the change links as described above, untick the check box and update.

If there are no places left at a school or the study site is no longer available, you can detach it from a course. If a place becomes available, you can simply attach it again.

If you need to remove a school or a study site from your account entirely, you’ll need to go to the ‘Schools’ or Study sites’ tab to do this.
