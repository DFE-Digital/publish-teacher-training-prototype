If you are a new initial teacher training (ITT) provider, we can set up your organisation on Publish teacher training courses (Publish). You’ll then be able to publish courses to [Find postgraduate teacher training courses (Find)](https://www.find-postgraduate-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/).

To do this:

- contact us at becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk and we will send you a link to a form to complete
- enter the details and submit the form
- look out for a welcome email from us that will be sent to the first user you specified on the form

Once your organisation has been added, you’ll be able to add other users and create courses.

We'll also add your organisation to [Manage teacher training applications (Manage)](https://www.apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/provider/sign-in) at the same time.

If you need to remove an organisation from Publish or Manage, contact us at becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk.
