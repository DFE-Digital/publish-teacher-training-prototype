We have been committed to training teachers for over seven years placing students in schools across the region. Our lead school, St Helen's Primary, is based in the centre of Ipswich and provides additional training in supporting EAL children with its diverse, multi-cultural school setting. Additional SEN training is organised locally through our networks of schools, including one school with and SSC. We work closely with schools both within and outside of the trust. Some of the schools in our network are small, village schools. Others are large primaries based in the centre or outskirts of Ipswich. The majority of our students have gone on to work at one of our schools. Training and accreditation is provided by Suffolk and Norfolk School Centred Initial Teaching Training who offer outstanding primary PGCE programmes through the salaried, tuition and assessment-only routes.
