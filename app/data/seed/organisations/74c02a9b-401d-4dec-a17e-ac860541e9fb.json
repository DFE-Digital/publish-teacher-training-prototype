All of the mentors who will work with you are expert colleagues. We offer focused, subject and phase based mini-placements on both core and foundation subjects. The mini-placements are based around the curriculum delivery cycle, where training is delivered by expert colleagues, the Newcastle Research School, school based research/practice and review of learning.
