Training is delivered via our growing network of [Regional Training Hubs](http://www.nmapscitt.org.uk/partnership-structure/).

NMAPS trainees learn 'on the job' from the very beginning and benefit immediately from the insight into what teaching involves. Trainees are supported to 'find their feet' before delivering classes; schools in the NMAPS network do not require trainees to deliver a lesson unsupported until they are ready so. The NMAPS programme begins with a 3 day residential Induction Course at Headington School in Oxford in late August to prepare you for the year ahead.","trainWithDisability":"The National Mathematics and Physics SCITT (NMAPS) is committed to equal opportunities and is able to support trainees with additional needs.
