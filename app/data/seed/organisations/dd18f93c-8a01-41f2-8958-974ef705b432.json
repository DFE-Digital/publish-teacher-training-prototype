Our training aims to develop staff with the skills set and aptitude to work in an area of high academic attainment where children come to school to learn. Our small cohort of trainees means that relationships between trainees, mentors and schools are strong and communication is clear and effective. We were delighted that the previous cohort of 7 trainees all graduated as good or outstanding and, as was always the aim, successfully achieved jobs in primary schools very close to Durham. If you're keen to be the best teacher you can be and have aspirations to live and work locally to Durham, please give us a call.","trainWithDisability":"As a partnership of only 7 schools, we know each venue, headteacher and their governors closely. We have the flexibility to place trainees in the best location to suit their needs, safe in the knowledge that all schools in our partnership have robust policies and systems to support disabilities and additional needs.","showSchoolPlacements":"no","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"accreditedBodies":[],"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:51:30.303Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-14T20:55:36.347Z"}
