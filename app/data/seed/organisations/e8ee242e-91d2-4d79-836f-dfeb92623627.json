We feel our School Direct training programme combines the best elements of a traditional university-led PGCE training model with the benefits of a school-centred approach. We are proud to celebrate a 100% pass rate for trainees completing our programme, with many trainees choosing to remain with us and forge successful careers in the BPTTA family of schools.","trainWithDisability":"If you have a disability or learning difference, we encourage you to get in touch before you apply so we can discuss tailored support for your individual needs.
