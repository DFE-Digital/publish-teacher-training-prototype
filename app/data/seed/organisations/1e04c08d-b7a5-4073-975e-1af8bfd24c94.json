We aim to develop outstanding teachers. We do this by providing a subject / class mentor who supports you on a daily basis, in addition there is a professional mentor looking after your wider development. As a School Direct trainee you would also have access to your placement school's professional development programme.\n\nOur year's training comprises three main elements;\n-1) A main school placement where you feel part of the school. The aim is to mirror the life of a qualified teacher for the year.\n-2) A six week second school placement in a partner school.\n-3) Training and support from either Newman University or Birmingham City University.\n\nThe qualification at the end of the course awards QTS and PGCE. For the past three years 100% of our trainees, primary and secondary, have gained employment by the end of the course.\n\nFor further information\n-Primary training, St John Bosco Catholic Primary School in West Bromwich lead the Primary training\n[StJohnBosco](http://www.stjohnboscotsa.co.uk/school-direct/)\n-Secondary Training, Holly Lodge High School in Smethwick is the lead school for Secondary training.\n[HollyLodge](http://www.holly-lodge.org/sites/default/files/LearnToTeach/index.html)","trainWithDisability":"We have a wide range of partner schools across a large geographical area.
