Graduates can train at Woodside or in one of our partner schools to gain a qualified teacher status. We have three trainee teachers working at Woodside this year and other trainees in our partner schools. Trainees are all graduates and start with a small teaching commitment, building this through the year. They will also work for half a term with a different age group in another school in the partnership. Being a training school helps us to recruit good quality staff who can already teach according to the school's expectations and quickly develop their commitment to the school. A number of trainees have been given permanent teaching posts at Woodside. We offer non salaried places, although would consider a salaried place for certain degrees.","trainWithDisability":"Here at Woodside Academy we are committed to offering all prospective trainees the opportunity to gain QTS.
