However, we would be very happy to discuss how we could meet the needs of a trainee with any access requirements.\nTeaching London: LDBS SCITT has a degree of step-free access, but as the building was a Victorian school, we are unable to fully accommodate wheelchair access. We are always willing to discuss, and where possible, adapt to meet individual needs.\nThe well-being of our trainees is paramount, which is why you will be automatically enrolled into the Employee Assistance Programme with the Education Support Partnership. This provides 24/7 individual support and counselling, in addition to our in-house advice and support.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"accreditedBodies":[{"id":"720894da-360a-4f7a-9835-7ce7beb3c6de","code":"L59","name":"Teaching London: LDBS SCITT","description":"An Outstanding provider (Ofsted: 2017), Teaching London puts pupils at the heart of your training.
