If the help you need is not covered by your provider making reasonable adjustments, you may also be able to get support from Access to Work. This could include a grant to help cover the costs of practical support in the workplace.\nIt’s up to you if you want to tell your school or training provider about your disability. The main advantage of doing this is to let them put support in place.Any information you give about your disability is protected under the Data Protection Act 2018. If you’re offered a place on a teacher training course, you may have to complete a fitness questionnaire before starting. We ask relevant questions to make sure you’re able to teach.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:55:29.798Z","updatedAt":"2021-08-24T15:24:28.726Z"}
