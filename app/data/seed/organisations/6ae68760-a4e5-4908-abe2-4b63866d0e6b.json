  "trainWithUs": "Teach First provides School Centred Initial Teacher Training (SCITT) where you will gain Qualified Teacher Status and a PGCE. \n\nOur research-led course will give you plenty of hands-on experience. Our curriculum focuses on supporting you to put learning into practice to have an impact on pupils during a four day a week core school placement from mid-September to July. You will have one day a week to engage in training and development to support your teaching practice, as well as a six-week placement in a different school. The programme balances developing your subject knowledge and expertise alongside giving you a deep understanding of effective teaching methods and techniques to manage your workload and wellbeing.",
  "trainWithDisability": "Teach First’s vision is to build a fair education for all. Equality, diversity and inclusion are fundamental to our programmes and partnerships. You will have access to our partner university’s support services and we will take a tailored approach to all reasonable adjustments trainees may need. You will be able to apply to Student Finance for additional support dependent on eligibility, for example Disabled Students’ Allowance.",
