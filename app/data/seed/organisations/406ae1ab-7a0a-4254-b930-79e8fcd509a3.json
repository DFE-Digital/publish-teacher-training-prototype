We offer the opportunity to train to teach through a one year postgraduate programme in a culture of excellence, with nurture, support, mentoring and respect at its heart. We aim to ensure that you are challenged to be the best teacher you can be. We offer enrichment opportunities across our alliance schools from leadership pathways to half-day experiences in age groups and subjects outside of your specialism. This programme and the people you will encounter, will guide you through your first steps into the rest of your teaching career. The Shires Alliance comprises multiple schools and academies who have the experience, capacity and passion to deliver outstanding teacher training to the next generation of teachers.\nThere is no escaping that your training will bring challenges as well as successes. We believe that to be highly effective teacher, you need to receive the tools, support and motivation right from the start. We focus on full immersion into school life, putting theory into practice. Train with us and you can expect the highest levels of experience from educators who are passionate about their profession. Our aim is simple: we want to nurture acorns into oaks and your needs are at the heart of our training programme.
