We are an inclusive organisation which welcomes and treats both staff and trainees fairly and equally regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, race, ethnic origin or nationality. Our workforce should be representative of the communities we serve. At Barr Beacon SCITT we provide opportunities for applicants who are attending an assessment day to identify any special arrangements that they may require in advance of this day. It is important that communication is made by applicants in advance of assessment days so that appropriate time and resources can be discussed and made available. Details of how this is done can be found on Page 7 of the assessment day invitation pack that applicants are sent. Trainees can be assured that reasonable adjustments to the assessment process, the course and the documentation will be made to ensure that those trainees with a disability are not disadvantaged.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:48:37.554Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-14T16:50:04.361Z"}
