Trainees within our partnership will be given placement opportunities in supportive, forward-thinking primary schools which all have strong links. The lead school, Oakridge, is rated 'Outstanding' by Ofsted. Intensive support will be given throughout the programme from experienced teachers and mentors. As a result, all trainees emerge from our teacher training programme as good or better teachers.
