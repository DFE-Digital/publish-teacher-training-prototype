Teachers transform children and young people’s lives, “making a real difference”. The process of becoming a successful teacher is a complex one and requires support and training of the highest quality, which we are proud to offer.\nThe most significant advantage of school-based training is that, from day one, you are in a secondary school environment, acquiring the knowledge and skills required for effective teaching.\nThe most important elements of our training programme are that:\n1. We recognise that relationships and human-first teaching are paramount to success in the classroom and;\n2. We use the latest research, particularly focused on cognitive load theory, to inform how we prepare our trainees for teaching.\nTrainees who have a passion for pursuing the SEN option can be placed at Dove House for one of their placements.
