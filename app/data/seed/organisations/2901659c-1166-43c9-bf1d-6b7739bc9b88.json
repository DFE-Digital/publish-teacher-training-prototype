Teachers transform children and young people’s lives, “making a real difference”. The process of becoming a successful teacher is a complex one and requires support and training of the highest quality, which we are proud to offer.\nThe most significant advantage of school-based training is that, from day one, you are in a secondary school environment, acquiring the knowledge and skills required for effective teaching.\nThe most important elements of our training programme are that:\n1. We recognise that relationships and human-first teaching are paramount to success in the classroom and;\n2. We use the latest research, particularly focused on cognitive load theory, to inform how we prepare our trainees for teaching.\nTrainees who have a passion for pursuing the SEN option can be placed at Dove House for one of their placements. Partnership school’s professional themes programmes also provide trainees with an opportunity to further develop their knowledge and application of effective teaching and learning of children with SEN.
