The school benefits from a high proportion of teaching staff that have undertaken the course and has an experienced group of mentors to call upon. Feedback on the quality of the training received demonstrates that we are effective in providing all of our graduate trainees with both general and more bespoke professional development. As a recently formed federation, the opportunity for full time employment following completion of the course is increasingly likely. We would welcome visits to the school and would consider applicants for graduates looking for support staff roles whilst developing their school experience prior to commencement of the course.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"accreditedBodies":[],"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:51:40.142Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-28T22:30:02.818Z"}
