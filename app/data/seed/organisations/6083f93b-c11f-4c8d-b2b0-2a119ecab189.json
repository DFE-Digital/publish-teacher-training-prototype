Working under the umbrella of North East London Teaching School Hub (NELTSH) and our awarding body UCL Institute of Education, we are well positioned to deliver some of the best teacher training in the world. Participants benefit from a unique school-based learning programme in partnership with a world-class university. This training route is referred to as 'School Direct'. Led by Alexandra Park School, all partner schools within the alliance have achieved 'Good' or 'Outstanding' Ofsted ratings and are conveniently located in North London. Our aim during the course is to create an environment in which staff, pupils and trainee teachers feel valued and supported. We have worked with trainee teachers for 15 years and fully recognise how much vibrancy, enthusiasm and drive they bring to a school community. By allowing trainees to engage with two schools during their training, we provide an opportunity to experience a diverse and contrasting range of teaching and learning styles. Our staff, are our most valuable resource and have a proven track record in training and professional development. All our partner schools have successfully developed new teachers for over a decade. This is demonstrated by a growing number of trainees choosing to embark on their new careers at these schools, upon completion of the course.\nOur mission statement is simple: 'Recruiting, supporting and developing the very best teachers’.","trainWithDisability":"Our University partner UCL IOE has full disabled access and a well-established Disability and Wellbeing team who provide support for students with a range of conditions.
