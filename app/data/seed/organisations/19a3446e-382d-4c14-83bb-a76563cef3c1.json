We work with ‘Outstanding’ schools leading innovations in education, as well as schools that may have difficulties in reaching outcome targets at the end of key stages. \n\nWhen you train with Leeds Trinity, you’ll experience best practice in school improvement, whichever school you train in.\n\nYou’ll work with expert school mentors while on placement and receive help, advice and support from University-based link tutors. This combination means you’ll get specialist training on teaching the most difficult aspects of subject content, and understanding children and young people at various ages and stages of development.\n\nAfter you graduate, we offer excellent support for teachers in the early stages of their career, and have a very strong Early Career Teacher (ECT) programme, with CPD, an active online community, and an annual conference.","trainWithDisability":"We’re committed to ensuring that every student with potential, regardless of their background or circumstances, has the opportunity to benefit from higher education.
