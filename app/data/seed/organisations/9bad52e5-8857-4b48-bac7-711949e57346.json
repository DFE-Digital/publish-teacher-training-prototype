You can train as a secondary or primary teacher to gain QTS (Qualified Teacher Status) and there is an opportunity to complete a PGCE. School Direct is a hands on, practical school based training programme which allows student teachers to work in their school from day 1. This ensures that you are able to work through an entire school year in your school and really feel part of the learning community. We pride ourselves on offering superb support and training opportunities including individual subject and professional mentors, flexible time to manage workload, a range of schools for contrasting placements and high quality continued professional development. We look forward to receiving your application.","trainWithDisability":"We welcome all aspiring student teachers and will support all individuals in their training needs.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"accreditedBodies":[],"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:50:10.906Z","updatedAt":"2021-08-24T20:43:42.633Z"}
