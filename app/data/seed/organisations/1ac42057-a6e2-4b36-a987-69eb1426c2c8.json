We have an excellent local reputation for providing teacher training of the highest quality. We are a large secondary school so can offer a range of subjects and during the year we have many trainees on placement with us. Our trainees and new staff often comment upon the warm welcome they receive and how quickly they get to know students and colleagues alike. \n\nHow the placements work are you have your first placement in one school for all of the autumn term; spring term is spent in a second school and then you return to the first placement school for the summer term until the end of June. This placement structure provides you with a breadth of experiences to help inform your choice of the type of school you wish to work in as an Early Career Teacher.\n\nOur overall aim is to train you not as a teacher for a specific school but as a future member of the teaching profession.","trainWithDisability":"Suffolk and Norfolk SCITT supports all trainees based on their individual needs.
