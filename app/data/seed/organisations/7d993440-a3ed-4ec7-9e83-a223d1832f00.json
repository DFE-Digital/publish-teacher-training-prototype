Applying for a School Direct place through us will guarantee an exceptional teacher training experience, either at Caludon Castle School or at one of our other successful partner schools. Caludon Castle is a very good school with an excellent record of teacher training: in 2020 – 2021, we trained over 20 potential teachers, through both the PGCE and School Direct routes, all achieving at least a ‘good’ grade by the end of their training year, with the majority being graded as outstanding. All of our trainee teachers have always been able to secure jobs in teaching by the end of their training years.\nOur partner provider, The University of Warwick, confirm the Alliance is ‘outstanding’\n“outstanding training provision for all trainees”\nPractical, school-based training takes place at the lead school and within the Alliance. We offer placements across most subject areas. Trainees are supported by experienced Subject Mentors: experts in their academic fields.\n“The feedback on placements is very positive, providing excellent training experiences for the trainees.” Director of Teacher Education, Warwick University.\nSchool Direct programmes in schools contain a core Professional Studies element and a series of Subject Studies sessions designed for the chosen specialism. Trainees will have a complementary experience in another secondary or primary school, immersing themselves in school life. Trainees, also, spend time gaining experience in Special Education within their own schools.","trainWithDisability":"The staff at Caludon Castle Alliance are committed to ensuring that all students and teachers develop their full potential.
