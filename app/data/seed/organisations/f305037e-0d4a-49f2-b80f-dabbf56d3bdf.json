Our partnership consists of five secondary schools (rated outstanding or good) and includes a service which supports children in mainstream educational settings with a diagnosis of Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD). All teach students from ages 11-18, giving trainee teachers the opportunity to teach the entire secondary age range. Teach Maidenhead schools are conveniently located, meaning trainees can engage with all five schools in the partnership and experience a diverse and contrasting range of teaching and training practices. Teach Maidenhead works closely with the University of Reading to plan and deliver training programmes. The support provided to trainees is first rate, with intensive subject-based training from experts at the University of Reading and close mentoring from experienced teachers in each school. Another popular feature of our training programme is the weekly professional studies training sessions which involve all trainees, and are led by experts from across the Teach Maidenhead group. Students and staff warmly welcome trainee teachers and recognise their valuable contribution to the school community. Successful trainees have access to opportunities to apply for teaching posts at all five schools, each of which provides an exemplary level of support to NQTs in their first year as well as further career development and opportunities.\nAll trainees gain QTS (Qualified Teacher Status) and PGCE (Postgraduate Certificate in Education) as well as 60 credits towards a Masters Degree.","trainWithDisability":"Teach Maidenhead seeks the best potential teachers and welcomes applications from disabled candidates.
