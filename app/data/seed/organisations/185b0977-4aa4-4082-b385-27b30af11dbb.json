We have a very high rate of trainees completing and passing our PGCE course. All of those who have completed our course in the last 5 years have succeeded in finding teaching jobs.\nForward Education offers a range of learning and development opportunities for all of our staff. Beyond your PGCE year, if you started your employed teaching journey with us, we offer our Early Career Teachers (ECTs), a comprehensive two year induction, which includes access to the national Early Career Framework, Trust and school based induction and training about various aspects of SEND pedagogy. Beyond your two year induction we also offer a range of leadership development, curriculum subject development and further training on a wide range of SEND pedagogy . As a result nearly all of those who have trained with us are still teaching and some have moved successfully into middle / senior leadership roles within our Trust.","trainWithDisability":"As a provider that specialises in SEND we are committed to supporting trainees who have disabilities or other needs because we believe that this gives you an insight into the needs of our pupils.\nOur schools and the university all have accessibility plans and we will work closely with you to consider any reasonable adjustments that we can make to your training and school placements to enable you to succeed.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"accreditedBodies":[],"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:55:21.277Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-16T19:34:26.112Z"}
