It isn't a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach for us. We work closely with two local Universities, Newman University and The University of Warwick, to offer our School Direct programmes in our schools. All of our courses allow trainees to gain QTS, a PGCE and Masters credits. If you train with us, you will receive an excellent programme of support and professional development to enable you to become an outstanding classroom practitioner. Our friendly and approachable staff are highly experienced in training and developing teachers and we are incredibly proud to have a 100% recruitment rate.
