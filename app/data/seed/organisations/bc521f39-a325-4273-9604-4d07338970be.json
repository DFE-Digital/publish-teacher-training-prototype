Formed in 2012, the trust has been at the forefront of radical new approaches to improve education. It has built up an impressive track record in improving existing schools and launching high-quality new provision.\nOur Teaching School Hub is in Norwich and our placement schools are in East Anglia. East Anglia is a fantastic place to live and work, with unspoilt countryside, vibrant communities, and easy access to London.\nWe think that what makes you special is your knowledge of, and passion for, the subject you teach. We want to help you share this knowledge and passion with children. One of the most exciting things about training as a teacher is the need to broaden your knowledge - there is always something more to learn! This is a philosophy that runs to the core of our training programmes. As a trainee with Inspiration Teacher Training, you will have a unique, tailored, and special journey through your training year. We have recruited a central team of subject specialist leads with exceptional reputations in their fields who will be leading your programme.\nWe guarantee that your mentor will be a subject specialist who has read the same course materials that you have. You will have allocated time every week with your mentor focused on discussing readings, setting targets, and reviewing your progress.","trainWithDisability":"We do not discriminate against trainees on the basis of age; race; sex; disability; sexual orientation; gender reassignment; marriage and civil partnership; pregnancy and maternity; religion, faith or belief.
