Our programme offers a unique opportunity to work closely with a small cohort of trainees within a supportive environment with a particular emphasis on the 3 - 7 age range. However, there is an opportunity to train across the full primary range. We work with a wide range of primary and nursery schools to provide excellent school placement experience. Schools are mainly located in the Welwyn Garden City and Stevenage area, however we do have links across Hertfordshire. Acorns trainees are based at a main host school through their training year, undertaking a second 'out of phase' placement at another school during the Spring term. Trainees are supported by a mentor in their placements schools, as well as being supported by Pilgrim Partnership tutors and Acorns staff. The Pilgrim Partnership training takes place once a week on a Monday. Successful trainees will obtain QTS status and in addition to this also study for a PGCE.","trainWithDisability":"Acorns and The Pilgrim Partnership with its partner schools are committed to promoting equality of opportunity to ensure we meet the needs of all students.
