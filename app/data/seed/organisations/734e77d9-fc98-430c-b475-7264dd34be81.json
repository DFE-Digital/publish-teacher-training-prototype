Although diverse in location and context, we share high aspirations for all and are committed to personalised learning and development. Our schools have a proven record of high achievement in English and maths. We also have strengths in provision for vulnerable pupils including those with special educational needs and disabilities.\nOur experience of raising standards and closing the gap for disadvantaged children means that we can support trainees to provide the best experience for all children in their care. Well-established and effective systems for assessment mean that trainees will learn how to track and manage pupil progress. We promote the development of the whole child through enriching curriculums, music, art, performing arts and forest schools.\nOur schools are friendly and happy environments. We pride ourselves on being welcoming places to work and learn, ready to support trainees and ensure they gain the best possible preparation for life as a teacher. \"I had an excellent experience while on my alternate placement at George Washington Primary, receiving support from all members of staff.\" Michelle Anderson, SD trainee \"The support provided was invaluable.
