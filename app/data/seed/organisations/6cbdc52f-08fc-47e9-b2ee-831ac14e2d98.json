In the most recent [`Good Teacher Training Guideâ€™]( https://www.buckingham.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/GTTG17fin.pdf) the SCITT is in the top five Initial Teacher Training (ITT) providers nationally and is the top primary provider in the East Midlands. All SCITT trainees are also students at the University of Leicester, gaining an internationally recognised PGCE, with 60 Masters level credits.\nFour local Teaching School Alliances (TSAs) work collaboratively with the SCITT as their ITT partner. As a result many of our students are employed in these TSAs, enjoying excellent access to the TSA NQT and career development programmes from the very start of their teaching careers. Most importantly, over 95% of trainees ever trained with the SCITT have given their training the top rating of \"Very Good\" . \"I have come out of the SCITT fully prepared, not only as an NQT, but for the full roles and responsibilities of a teacher. Nothing has been a shock to me, I feel well organised, well supported and have even managed to establish that all important work/life balance!\nI am so grateful for the SCITT course and everybody who helps to run it, please pass on my thanks!\n( Emily, 4 weeks into her NQT year , Google Review, Sept 2019)","trainWithDisability":"Education and training providers have a duty under the Equality Act 2010 to anticipate the adjustments that disabled students may need. The SCITT is committed to actively promoting equal opportunities in employment and to encouraging participation by disabled people in public life. If you would describe yourself as having a disability, in accordance with the Equality Act (2010), and need any adjustments made to promote equality of opportunity, please contact us, as soon as possible, so we can discuss your requirements. The best place for you to do this is on your UCAS form. However, you can also do it at any time during your studies, either by telling a member of SCITT Management. As we are partnered with the University of Leicester, our students can access the Student Support Services offered. The AccessAbility Centre offers support and advice for students with dyslexia or other specific learning difficulties as well as working with students who have sensory disabilities, mobility difficulties; mental health conditions and autism. The Centre offers study skills support.
