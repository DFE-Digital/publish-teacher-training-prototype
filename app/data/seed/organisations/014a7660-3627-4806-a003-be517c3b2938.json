We train in both primary and secondary phases and will consider applications for all subjects at secondary level. TCP also accepts trainees from the Researchers In Schools (RIS) programme and will be applying for provider status for the Apprenticeships programme during this year. We also offer, in partnership with an HEI, a PGCE element for those who want to take on extra study. On the course you will be in school four days a week and follow a central training programme on Fridays, which augments your subject knowledge for teaching and your general professional development. During the course you will receive strong support from TCP in the form of a Subject Specialist Tutor (secondary) or a Phase Manager (Primary). Well-being of trainees is crucial and we have developed a strong mechanism to support trainees in this respect. A qualified counsellor is available at no cost to you. Over the course you will produce an e-portfolio of evidence, monitored by TCP and your school(s). You will also have assignments to complete and your teaching will be observed regularly, with feedback to ensure strong classroom practice. In November 2017, TCP was graded “good” by Ofsted and we shall be pleased if you view our final report on the OfSTED website.","trainWithDisability":"The Cambridge Partnership (TCP) welcomes applications from candidates with disabilities.
