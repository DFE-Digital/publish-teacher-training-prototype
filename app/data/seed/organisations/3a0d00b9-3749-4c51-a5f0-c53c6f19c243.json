We have combined our experience in order to develop the role of schools who have extensive experience in school based initial teacher training. We have a cross-phase alliance of 13 schools, both secondary and primary located across the inner city region of Birmingham. The Caritas Christi group of schools have formalised a Catholic based regional network of schools, using their collective experiences to provide extensive support to staff and trainees. Our close partnership of inner-city schools, Universities and other organisations is important to us because our schools are addressing similar needs and challenges: for example, very high levels of EAL, SEND, poverty and low baseline achievement in diverse communities which need our support. We are dedicated to reducing inequalities and giving children every opportunity to succeed at school and beyond. We are all committed to the best possible achievement for our children and staff and we set expectations high so that community aspirations can be raised. St Paul’s Caritas Christi works in partnership with the University of Birmingham, Newman University and the University of Warwick (Ofsted Outstanding for Initial Teacher Education) for all of our secondary subjects and the primary (general) programme, providing high quality courses and support for trainees.","trainWithDisability":"Members of the ITT Support Team are highly experienced professional mentors from our schools.
