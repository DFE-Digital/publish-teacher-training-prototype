We provide weekly drop in sessions and regular progress meetings to monitor progress and well being. The Mentors, ITT co-ordinators and Tutors are also there to support the trainees and monitor their progress and well being. We include sessions on resilience and well being, both of which are very important to us. We take well being very seriously and offer opportunities to track your own resilience and have signed all of our trainees to individual support and counselling with Education Support. We cater our training to the needs of our students, this may include dyslexia, so we ensure that the resources are on the portal ready to access before the session and discuss individual needs both at the interview stage and during your training.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:54:16.277Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-18T18:24:55.453Z"}
