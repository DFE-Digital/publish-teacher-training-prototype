Our partnership is committed to providing the highest standard of education in diverse and relatively disadvantaged urban communities. We transform lives, both of trainee teachers and the students within the local schools; we do not merely educate or train. We will provide training of the highest quality, delivered by outstanding practitioners in a diverse and stimulating range of local schools. We aim to deliver a bespoke training package, making the most of your knowledge and skills. You will be placed in two of the Partnership schools and, after a year’s successful training, you will achieve a PGCE with QTS. As a partnership, we are committed to helping you develop professionally, by providing an extensive programme of Continuing Professional Development. The Director of The Yorkshire Rose Teaching Partnership is also a strategic lead for the Early Career Framework with the Calderdale and Kirklees Teaching School Hub. This means we have a detailed and up to date understanding of the 'Golden Thread' that runs from ITT to the ECF to the new NPQs. Support will continue even when The Yorkshire Rose Teaching Partnership trainees become Early Career Teachers. In addition, Batley Girls' High School has been graded Outstanding by OFSTED. It is our aim to train the next generation of outstanding teachers in West Yorkshire.
