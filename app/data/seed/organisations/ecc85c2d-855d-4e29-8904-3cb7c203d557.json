Each trainee, in their school, has a unique position: learning how to plan so that all pupils and students make good progress in lessons and over time. Our aim is that the e-Qualitas curriculum is clearly understood in schools and provides trainees with models and multiple opportunities to rehearse and refine particular approaches through a shared vision that engages and prepares trainees for the reality of the classroom through sustainable workload and support."}],"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:52:14.627Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-26T16:26:38.796Z"}
