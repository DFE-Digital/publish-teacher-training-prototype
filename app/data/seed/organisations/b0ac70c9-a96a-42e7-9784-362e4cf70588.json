Within NET there are training opportunities available in a range of academies based across the North of England. This route is for those who have the confidence and commitment to work alongside expert practitioners, in a strong partnership of schools, to develop teaching skills on a daily basis and to meet the professional Teachers' Standards over the course of the year. Successful applicants to the School Direct QTS programme also study for a PGCE, validated by Leeds Beckett University, which accumulates 60 Master's credits; all as part of a framework which combines academic study with direct classroom application. Through this programme trainees enjoy the advantage of an 'on the job' experience, where the realities of life as a teacher are fully explored and understood. The majority of time is spent in one school, where trainees are supported by school based trainers, individual mentors and a personal link tutor. In addition to this, trainees attend school-led and centre-based training sessions, on specific subject knowledge and general classroom practice, which supplement the incomparable first-hand experience that is gained from being a full member of a school community for a year. Please note that, although Dyke House Academy is the named school for the consortium, your placements will be organised by the NET staff college and you may be placed at any of the academies within our Trust.","trainWithDisability":"Educate Group - Initial Teacher Training has a designated tutor for trainees with disabilities and other needs.
