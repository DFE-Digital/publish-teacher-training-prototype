Training balances conceptual understanding with the practical toolkit trainees need to teach in schools.’ (Ofsted 2017)\nAltius is a partnership of primary and secondary schools across Greater Manchester, Stockport and Cheshire. In 2017 Altius was judged to be an outstanding provider of Initial Teacher Training by Ofsted. Cheadle Hulme High School,(11-18), is the lead Altius school and is a consistently high performing state school and judged outstanding in all areas by Ofsted in two successive inspections. Trainees who successfully complete their training are recommended for qualified teacher status (QTS) 11-16 (secondary) or 5-11 (primary).
