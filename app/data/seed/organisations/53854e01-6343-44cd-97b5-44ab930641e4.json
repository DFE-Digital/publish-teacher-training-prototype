We have run School Direct with Exeter since the programme began and we believe that they are an outstanding provider; together we will give you the best start in your teaching career.","trainWithDisability":"For our students who have disabilities and other special needs we believe we offer outstanding support. We do the same for our trainees. Our facilities mean that the building is fully accessible on all levels, with lifts and ramps, and the site is open with wide corridors and pathways to support anyone with physical needs. We have many students in wheelchairs, we also have visually and hearing impaired students - each with us due to the fact that we have both the facilities and the staff/understanding to support their needs.\nOn our School Direct course we have supported trainees with both disabilities and training needs, including many trainees who are dyslexic. They have all excelled with us and have commented positively on the support that was afforded to them. The University of Exeter provides comprehensive student services that include AccessAbility and Wellbeing teams, Student Learning Skills Service, Student Advice Unit, Counselling Service, Students’ Union Advisors, Student Health Centre, Family Centre and the Chaplaincy.
