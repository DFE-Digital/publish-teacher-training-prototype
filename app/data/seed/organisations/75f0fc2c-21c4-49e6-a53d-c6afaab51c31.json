Although we cannot guarantee that you will be placed in a school of your choice, we will ensure that placements are in schools within reasonable distance from your home. Placements are in our partnership schools which offer Primary focussed training in a range of contexts. Our partnership schools are passionate about the importance of outstanding provision for our children as they progress through their school lives. Training is delivered through personalised training with your own mentor and through central training sessions led by Specialist leaders, headteachers, deputy headteachers and classroom practitioners. Our staff are our most valuable resource with a proven track record for delivering high quality training and professional development. They are exemplary in their expectations and are eager to share their skills, knowledge and practice with the next generation of teachers.
