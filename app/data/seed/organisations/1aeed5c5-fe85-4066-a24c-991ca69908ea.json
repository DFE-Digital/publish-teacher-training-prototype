We enable you to take as seriously as ourselves issues related to inclusion, equity and social justice.\nKeele University and our school based teaching rooms have full access. Applicants who would benefit from additional support in relation to access should let us know on their application so that we can facilitate appropriate placements. We regularly support trainees with a variety of needs including for example dyslexia and dyspraxia, and find that they are able to thrive on our course. At the start of the programme you will all have the opportunity to disclose any needs that they may have so that the appropriate support can be put into place. Your mental health and wellbeing is a prime concern of ours. On the course you will be enabled to support others and so we will ensure that you are aware of how we can help you to meet your own needs so that you can thrive and enjoy our amazing profession.
