The Lincolnshire SCITT provides a dynamic, supportive and school centred environment in which to train to teach within both the primary and secondary phases. We offer a highly regarded training programme, with expert and committed staff eager to share their skills, experience and practice with the next generation of teachers.\nOperating within the city, county and borders of Lincolnshire, the SCITT works with a number of lead and placement schools experienced in the field of teacher training. Schools in our partnership subscribe to the same ethos and value the contribution enthusiastic trainees can bring to our schools and pupils. Within a caring and stimulating atmosphere, trainees are supported in their journey to qualify to teach.\nTo enable professional practice to be set within the context of academic and evidence-based research, The University of Lincoln co-delivers the taught programme and assesses trainees for a Post Graduate Certificate of Education (PGCE) with 60 Masters’ credits.","trainWithDisability":"Lincolnshire SCITT recognises the needs of all its trainees and will implement a support plan for trainees with disabilities and other needs. As an organisation we value the personal pastoral care that we put in place for each of our trainees and will work collaboratively to ensure that full support is given from the central team and school-based staff. In addition, all trainees are students of the University of Lincoln and as such have access to the full range of support offered by the university.","showSchoolPlacements":"no","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"accreditedBodies":[],"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:52:29.432Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-03T22:36:07.348Z"}
