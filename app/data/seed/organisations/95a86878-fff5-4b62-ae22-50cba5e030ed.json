Candidates must have a desire to work with young people, a passion for their subject and a commitment to raising pupil achievement.\nAs part of our successful ITT programme, candidates will receive excellent training from experienced staff working in association with TES Institute. The unique blended learning programme combines school based training and online learning materials facilitated by a network of experienced subject specialists. The training experience is also further enhanced through the organization of a number of visits to other educational establishments, such as special schools, primary schools and schools in an urban environment. We celebrate the quality of teaching and learning which takes place across the partnership. This provides excellent role models from within the teaching staff and opportunities to observe outstanding teaching. The pupils in these schools are a credit to each individual school and enjoy good relationships with their teachers to create a positive environment for learning. Each school aspires to engender an 'appetite for learning' within its pupil community, both in the classroom and within the range of extra-curricular activities it provides.","trainWithDisability":"TES Institute and Plume Community Teaching Partnership are committed to promoting access for people with disabilities and additional needs.
