Most of our schools are in Hammersmith & Fulham and Kensington & Chelsea, but we also have schools in Westminster, Richmond, Twickenham, Ealing, Hounslow, Hillingdon and Brent. The WLTTA office is based at Sacred Heart High School, in Hammersmith.\nWe have formal partnership arrangements for teacher training with four universities\n* St Mary's University, Twickenham\n* University of Roehampton\n* University College London (UCL)\n* London Metropolitan University\nOUR APPROACH TO TRAINEE RECRUITMENT\nWe pride ourselves in the support that we provide potential applicants and in the speed of our shortlisting. We have a detailed website (do please look) [wltta.org.uk](https://www.wltta.org.uk/)\nThe WLTTA office is staffed full time with teacher-training recruitment experts to talk to on the phone. With us, you choose the schools when you apply. If you perform well at interview but fail to get a place at your preferred school, we operate an internal referral system rather than rejecting you (see the interview section below).\nWe place significant emphasis on getting a good fit between trainee and school because we are all keenly focused on recruitment for qualified teachers in our alliance schools the following year.","trainWithDisability":"WLTTA and all our partner universities are committed to supporting students with disabilities.
