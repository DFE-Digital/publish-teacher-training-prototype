If you train to teach with us, you will have the opportunity to work with highly skilled professionals, drawn from a range of academic and professional backgrounds, who bring with them a rich diversity of experience. The tutor teams are dedicated to providing individually tailored support as you work towards becoming an aspirational Hope Teaching Professional. We have developed strong, long standing partnerships with a wide range of schools across the North West, enabling us to provide you with the best school based training. At Liverpool Hope, we are committed to the idea that teachers are formed not trained, and therefore provide the theoretical and practical support you will need to become an outstanding classroom practitioner. A programme of engaging and interactive lectures, seminars, workshops and conference days supports the school based experience, enabling you to become a critically reflective professional, confident in making well informed, independent judgements.\nTEF Gold Award\nThe Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) was introduced by the Government to build evidence about the performance of the UKâ€™s higher education sector. Based on the evidence gathered, TEF awarded Liverpool Hope the gold award in recognition of the consistently outstanding teaching, learning and outcomes delivered for its students.","trainWithDisability":"We endeavour to ensure equality of educational opportunity across our diverse student community.
