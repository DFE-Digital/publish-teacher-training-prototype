The partnership contains schools with high percentage EAL (English as an additional language) children, and high pupil premium cohorts, alongside contrasting catchments with a high percentage of gifted and talented pupils. This in itself provides the opportunity to train in a diverse range of high-achieving schools, three of which are currently graded outstanding, with several others displaying outstanding features; all the rest being termed 'good' by Ofsted.\nThe Partnership has worked effectively in partnership with Leeds Trinity University for many years, providing outstanding training opportunities for teaching at primary level. The lead school has also previously been a partnership school for School Direct with another outstanding school in the city.\nWe provide high-quality training, mentoring and coaching, in a supportive and caring environment (trainee feedback tells us so). And since training began, all our graduates have achieved 100% employment. Our Teaching School Alliance is aspirational and aims to support and train outstanding teachers of the future.\nWorking closely with the National College for Teaching and Leadership we lead and share research that shapes and develops the future of education. Our investment in training teachers extends beyond Initial Teacher Training, and many of our trainees go on to complete our NQT and RQT programmes, often progressing to our higher-level leadership training.","trainWithDisability":"As we are in partnership with Leeds Trinity, we are able to offer all our Trainees extra academic and pastoral support.
