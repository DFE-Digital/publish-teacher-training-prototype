We endeavour to provide an inclusive learning and teaching environment, in which all students can achieve their potential. This inclusive environment looks at the way in which courses are run, the accessibility of resources and materials, assessment types and support available with professional placements. Examples of inclusive practice would include accessible buildings, lecture information being made available two days prior to learning, presentations being consistent and easy to follow (colours, text formats etc.) and optional study skills seminars or sessions that students can attend.\nWe are very aware of the complex needs some students may have, such as students with mobility difficulties or visual impairments. We are able to advise these students on the support available through government organisations and specific reasonable adjustments the University are able to put in place, if barriers to learning are still present. Examples could include accessible formats for reading materials, text to speech software, extra time in examinations, alternative seating, ground floor lectures or height adjustment desks.\n[Student Futures Support](https://www.chester.ac.uk/campus-life/support-for-students/section) pride their selves on the quality of the support that they provide students.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"},"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:51:06.330Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-15T16:33:01.018Z"}
