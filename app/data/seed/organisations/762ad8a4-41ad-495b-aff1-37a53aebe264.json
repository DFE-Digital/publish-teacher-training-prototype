A comprehensive teacher development / training programme has been developed using outstanding teachers and other Specialists Leaders in Education (SLEs etc.) from across the Alliances of schools. Trainees attend 'Curriculum Development Sessions' (i.e. mostly on a Friday) and, as well as valuing the training, trainees find the sessions invaluable in allowing them to build relationships with other trainees where they share resources, experiences and emotions. They have a good social life as well! We do not differentiate between SCITT & School Direct, as to us they are the same.\nAll tuition-fee paying and salaried trainees also gain experience in local Partner Primary or Secondary Schools (as appropriate) with a focus on transition and in Partner Special Schools for additional experience with either: behavioural, medical or severely disabled pupils.\nWe also charge less than most other providers for a QTS only course, as we appreciate the need to keep costs down. We can do this because we are a genuinely schools-led partnership between the Local Authority, Teaching School Hub and partner schools and academies.","trainWithDisability":"All training venues and schools must meet statutory requirements for access, but individual needs will be accommodated wherever possible.","showSchoolPlacements":"no","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:54:22.956Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-20T21:44:01.693Z"}
