Our schools cover a wide geographical area, within travelling distance of the University of Hertfordshireâ€™s DeHavilland campus in Hatfield.\nThe course we offer is a School Direct PGCE (self funded). The course lasts a year and results in Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and a Post Graduate Certificate in Education. You will be based in one main school, getting the chance to learn 'on the job' and spend one day per week training at university. A shorter second placement occurs in the spring term. You spend one day a week throughout the year at The University of Hertfordshire.\nAll applications are processed by The Wroxham School. We will invite candidates to interview if their application meets the university criteria. If the applicant is accepted, they will be allocated to a school in their area that has requested a trainee. We are always willing to work with schools that are new to our alliance, especially if they are already keen to host a particular applicant.
