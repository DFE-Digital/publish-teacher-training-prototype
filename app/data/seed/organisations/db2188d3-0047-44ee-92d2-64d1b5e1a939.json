Disabled Students' Allowances (DSA) is a non-means tested grant available to U.K. disabled students who are applying for, or are attending, a course of Higher Education. There are specific eligibility conditions related to residence in the UK, which have to be met to qualify for this funding. DSA allowance covers some additional study-related costs that students will incur because of a disability, ongoing medical condition or mental health condition. Extra costs may include specialist equipment, a non-medical helper or travel costs.
