We have a strong teaching and learning ethos where every student encounters stimulating and intellectual challenges, but equally every trainee is supported and challenged by their mentors to craft their teaching skills and develop practice. This ensures that every member of a VITT school can focus on their individual needs; building self-confidence, self-esteem and preparing for future opportunities.\n\nEvery member of staff is unique and we recognise that what suits one might not suit another, therefore, we provide a structured training and development programme designed to support you at each stage of your career, combined with bespoke development opportunities and a range of benefits.","trainWithDisability":"VITT recruits our trainees on their individual merit.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"accreditedBodies":[{"id":"1165d5fd-11f4-4dab-99c9-47b309481463","code":"C10","name":"Canterbury Christ Church University","description":"Valley Invicta Teacher Training (VITT) works with Canterbury Christ Church University as the registered training provider for the School Direct programme.
