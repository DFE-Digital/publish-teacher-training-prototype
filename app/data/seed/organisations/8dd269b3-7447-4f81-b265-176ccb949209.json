Our programme leads to QTS and PGCE. We are especially interested in applications to Maths, English, Science, Languages and Humanities as there is a general shortage of teachers in these subjects locally. Our programme is accredited by Inspiring Leaders, an outstanding SCITT, based in the East Midlands.\nOur teacher training offers trainees an exceptional level of support, tailored to individual needs and delivered by trained mentors and coaches. Trainees have the opportunity to learn from classroom teachers and practitioners who are experts in their field. A commitment to train future teachers and leaders sits at the heart of our core purpose and ethos as a Trust.
