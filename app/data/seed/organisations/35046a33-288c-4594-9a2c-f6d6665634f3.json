They have a good social life as well! \n\nWe do not differentiate between SCITT & School Direct, as to us they are the same.\n\nAll tuition-fee paying and salaried trainees also gain experience in local Partner Secondary Schools and Academies with a focus on transition and also in Partner Special Schools for additional experience with either: behavioural, medical or severely disabled pupils.\n\nWe also charge less than most other providers for a QTS only course, as we appreciate the need to keep costs down. We can do this because we are a genuinely schools-led partnership between the Local Authority, Teaching School Hub and partner schools and academies.","trainWithDisability":"All training venues and schools must meet statutory requirements for access, but individual needs will be accommodated wherever possible.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"accreditedBodies":[{"id":"762ad8a4-41ad-495b-aff1-37a53aebe264","code":"D51","name":"Doncaster ITT Partnership","description":"We aren't just ‘partnered’ with the Doncaster ITT Partnership, our Alliance of Schools is the Primary side of the Partnership, working alongside our Secondary Colleagues, Teaching School Hub and LA colleagues.\\r\\n\\r\\nBased in Doncaster Council, the Partnership is Ofsted Inspected and has been successfully delivering Schools-based ITT in Doncaster since 2003.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Partnership is the ONLY DfE Accredited ITT Provider in Doncaster and is one of only 5 in the whole of South Yorkshire!"}],"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:57:10.406Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-23T19:15:12.003Z"}
