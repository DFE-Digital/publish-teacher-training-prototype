The Disability Advice Team at LJMU will help you access the support you need. The best time to contact the Disability Advice Team is before you start your course. By contacting the team before you begin and disclosing your disability, you'll be able to receive support from when you arrive. Email: disability@ljmu.ac.uk Tel: 0151 231 3164/3165.\nIf you need an Individual Student Learning Plan (ISLP) which sets out the support you may need and who is responsible for ensuring support is in place, this will be put in place by an LJMU Disability Adviser following discussion of your needs. Once finalised, your plan will be sent to you via email. As soon as you have agreed the ISLP it will be sent to your Disability Coordinator and then, with your agreement, passed on to the relevant academic and support staff.\nAll trainees are encouraged to disclose any specific learning need that they experience, in order to make any adjustments, both at Archbishop Blanch, our Partner Schools and LJMU. As part of the enrolment process to Teacher Training Programmes all students are required to complete a Health Questionnaire and some may be asked to attend a screening appointment with our Occupational Health Unit. This is designed to ensure that arrangements are in place, from the outset, to support any students who may need additional support or reasonable adjustments to be made. \nFor information on school facilities contact us at schooldirect@blanch.org.uk","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"accreditedBodies":[],"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:49:21.183Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-27T17:36:42.492Z"}
