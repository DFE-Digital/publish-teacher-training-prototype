In addition, The OAKS also gives you the opportunity to observe teaching in alternative educational settings such as EAL, PRU, Special and Independent Schools.","trainWithDisability":"We have a dedicated support tutor, who supports our trainees with disability or any other need. It is important to state that they do not assess your teaching performance, this gives you the opportunity to speak honestly about your needs, but also enables the support tutor to have the freedom to help you and visit you; whether you are in placement school or here at The OAKS. This includes signposting through to developing individualised learning plans which may extend beyond the course date to enable you to successfully complete the programme.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"accreditedBodies":[],"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:53:17.340Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-28T18:16:12.108Z"}
