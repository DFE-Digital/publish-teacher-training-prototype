Our schools have a history of successfully training teachers and we have chosen SCITT as our main training provider due to its reputation for high quality tuition and support for students.\nAs part of our therapeutic arm called Lionwood Support School, we offer additional training sessions to enhance the excellent provision offered by SCITT. These hands-on training sessions aim to give practical advice and support for students in their placements and compliment the training provided. They include areas such as Speech, Language and Communication, Behaviour Management, Assessment and Data and Special Educational Needs and Disability. The sessions are run by specialists working within the Trust.\nWe also offer students the chance to visit our Trust schools, attend twilights where appropriate and provide support with applications for employment.","trainWithDisability":"Suffolk and Norfolk SCITT supports all trainees based on their individual needs.
