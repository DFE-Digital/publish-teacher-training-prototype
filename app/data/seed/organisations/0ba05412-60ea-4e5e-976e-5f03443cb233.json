Our unique and blended REAch Teach programme aims to create highly skilled teachers who are an integral part of a school community.\n\nWith more than 60 partner primary schools across the country, we enable you to train locally and grow nationally. The majority of schools we work with are academies within the REAch2 Academy Trust. Starting your teacher training within the REAch2 family of schools enables you to benefit from the wealth of opportunities that come with belonging to a national community of professionals, and a wide range of networks and development opportunities once qualified.\n\nWhichever school you train in, you will be part of the community from the very start of the academic year. Effective mentoring is at the heart of our programme and you will be supported by expert colleagues who will guide your introduction to the core body of knowledge, skills and behaviours that define great teaching. We invest in the training and development of your mentors, so that they can invest effectively in you. \n\n Our Lead School Tidemill Academy is a former National Teaching School which is amongst the top 3% of schools nationally for progress. We have supported over 120 trainees through their School Direct teacher training, with all trainees who completed the programme receiving a Good or Outstanding grading. An average of 80% of our trainees stay with us as early career teachers.","trainWithDisability":"We have a strong commitment to equality and inclusion and we seek to offer a first class education to all students, including students with disabilities.
