Wellbeing and inclusion are high on the Aspire agenda, with all our academies fully committed to supporting those with disabilities or other needs, making appropriate reasonable adjustments. We take great pride in matching trainees with placements, so trainees can be fully supported. Our trainees also complete a 'fitness to teach' check in advance of starting the course. Trainees with additional learning needs will have access to individual support from an academic tutor. Those with physical needs, such as hearing or visual impairments, will be supported to ensure full access to the course, with support for classroom strategies as needed. All trainees have mentor support. Ensuring development, mental health and wellbeing are of equally high importance throughout the course is fundamental to our approach. We want to get the best from our trainees, by giving them the best support we can.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"accreditedBodies":[],"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:54:39.661Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-30T18:11:23.321Z"}
