The college provides an ideal training environment thanks to our strong reputation for academic excellence, student achievement, quality pastoral care, and high standards of student behaviour. We are proud to have been rated 'outstanding' by Ofsted, and recognized as a Regional Teaching School Hub, National Support School and World-class school. St Mary’s College is the lead secondary school for Hull SCITT (School Centred Initial Teacher Training). Our partnership consists of other Hull secondary schools as well as the seven Catholic primary schools in Hull, which form St Cuthbert’s Catholic Academy Trust, so we are able to offer courses in Early Years and general Primary teacher training, as well as the full range of secondary subjects. Our schools provide a supportive and caring environment in which to train. St Mary's College and the other Trust schools have a Catholic ethos, and, whilst we welcome applications from people with any faith background (or none), you will notice that the atmosphere of tolerance, respect, forgiveness and reconciliation provides both staff and students with the ideal conditions for personal, academic and professional development. We also offer excellent facilities. All four secondary schools in our partnership - St Mary's College, The Marvell College, Kelvin Hall School and The Boulevard Academy - have benefited from multi-million-pound investment and boast state-of-the-art facilities which provide students and staff with excellent learning and working environments and access to the latest technology.","trainWithDisability":"St Mary's College and our St Cuthbert Trust primaries are fully accessible for wheelchair users with disabled parking bays, ramps, lifts and toilet facilities.
