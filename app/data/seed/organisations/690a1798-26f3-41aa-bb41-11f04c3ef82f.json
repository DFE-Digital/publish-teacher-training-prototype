Ofsted found Teach SouthEast to be outstanding in every category in its 2018 inspection. Led by two outstanding teaching schools, St John the Baptist (SJB) and Salesian School, who together with their vast network of partnership schools, are passionate about training and developing outstanding teachers of the future. Since its inception in 2013, Teach SouthEast has trained over 300 trainees; two thirds of these trainees remain in the partnership and one third are already in leadership positions. Of the 2018-19 cohort, 99% of trainees were graded as either good or outstanding when completing their Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). Teach SouthEast offers routes into teaching through School Direct, Core SCITT and Apprenticeship places. We seek to provide a dynamic environment where trainees on any of the ITT pathways can immerse themselves in what it is to be a great teacher, be nurtured within their own practice and be empowered to deliver outstanding lessons to our students. The two lead schools in the partnership have been graded as \"Outstanding\" by Ofsted in every category, which enables us to deliver an engaging and innovative training programme with unique opportunities to experience placement in primary, secondary and in a special school. All trainees are provided with a trained and dedicated mentor to lead you through your training year.","trainWithDisability":"We work with any trainees that have additional needs to put together a bespoke support plan that is individual to them. In the past, this has included; providing printouts of presentation slides; enabling the use of recording devices during training sessions; enabling the use of laptop computers during training sessions; considered seating arrangements; providing additional pastoral support meetings throughout the year and extra support with paperwork. Our unsalaried trainees, who study for the PGCE, also have access to support through the University of Sussex Student Life Centre. We pride ourselves on knowing our trainees well, and catering for any needs they may have.","createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:53:39.822Z","updatedAt":"2021-08-16T17:39:05.068Z"}
