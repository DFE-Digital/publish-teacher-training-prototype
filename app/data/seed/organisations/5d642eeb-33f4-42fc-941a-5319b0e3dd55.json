Before undertaking the course, you will be required to attend our Summer Institute which will be held between the 4th – 8th July 2022. This is an intensive programme designed to prepare you to hit the ground running in September. Sessions will be a mixture of online sessions and face-to-face contact with the United Teaching team.  Please be aware that places on the salaried route are highly competitive and there are a limited number of places on our programme.
