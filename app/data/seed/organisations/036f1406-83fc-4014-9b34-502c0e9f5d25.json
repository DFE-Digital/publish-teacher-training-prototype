'Since the SCITT opened, 99.5% trainees have been graded at least good by the end of the course and a high proportion of them have achieved an outstanding grade. There are no significant differences between the attainment of different groups because leaders’ promotion of equality and diversity lies at the heart of the SCITT’s work.'

This includes achieving distinctions in the two PGCE module assignments.\nOur partner university, Sheffield Hallam, provides access to all specialist equipment, counsellors and other student services that are provided for students at the university itself.\nSee\n(https://students.shu.ac.uk/regulations/\nequality_and_diversity/index.html)\nLETTA subscribes to the Employee Assistance Programme, part of the Education Support Partnership. This programme offers free, confidential support and guidance by qualified counsellors - 24/7, 365 days a year.\nSome schools have lifts. There is good access to all LETTA schools. LETTA will discuss individual needs with applicants, in order to ensure the right schools are selected for training and needs are communicated.
