Dunraven has a well established reputation for effective staff development and long-standing programmes for developing teachers, including traditional ITT routes, Teach First, and School Direct. We offer support and professional guidance in making a transition from support roles in school into teacher training and employment.\nWe promote 'Excellence for All' by recruiting and training high calibre teachers for local schools. Our trainees have gone on to successful employment, mostly within our Partnership. The majority of our School Direct trainees have been formally assessed as 'Outstanding' by the time they complete their training.\nDunraven is part of the South Lambeth Schools' Partnership working with ten local primary schools and SL6, a post-16 collaboration with local secondary schools, which provides a wide range of training and development opportunities for our trainees. A significant building programme means the school now has purpose-built facilities.\nOur School Direct training partnership is a strong local network of Lambeth primary and secondary schools. It includes Corpus Christi Roman Catholic Primary School, Crown Lane, Dunraven, Sunnyhill, Goldfinch, Julian's, St Andrew's Catholic, Rosendale and Van Gogh Primary Schools. Secondary partners are the The Elm Green School, Trinity Academy, St Mary's High School and City Heights Academy. Dunraven School, all-through from 4-18, offers training in both primary and secondary phases.\n[Sharing Excellence Partnership](https://www.sharingexcellence.org.uk/1134/school-direct)","trainWithDisability":"All our training programmes are bespoke and tailored to meet individual needs, reflecting applicants' skills and experience and any health or disability requirements. Where possible we collaborate with our training providers to adapt training provision to support trainees with disabilities and other needs. Feedback from previous trainees suggests high levels of satisfaction with the support we offer them, carefully co-ordinated between school and training provider. We recognise that teaching is a rewarding but demanding career and that there are times when even the best trainees will face challenges. We promote trainee well-being and resilience to enable them to make a long-term commitment to the teaching profession and this is at the heart of our training provision. The University of Roehampton offers an extensive range of student support and well-being services. There is a strong tutorial support system in the School of Education and during school placements. Trainees can apply for a Statement of Adjustment to ensure their needs are met. Dyslexia Services offer support for specific learning difference (SpLDs) such as Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, Dyscalculia and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).\n[University of Roehampton](https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/disability-services/)","showSchoolPlacements":"no","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"accreditedBodies":[{"id":"33037eab-f75d-4350-b1e2-967c41e9d4c6","code":"R48","name":"Roehampton University","description":"The University is a leading provider of teacher training in the UK with 175 years’ history, working with over 350 schools.
