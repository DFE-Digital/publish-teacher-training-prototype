Our wide partnership gives opportunities to gain experience in coastal, rural or urban school settings, with trainees predominately placed within thirty minutes of home. Trainees can express a preference for placements in both mainstream and special schools. Our teacher training programme combines:\n* school based practice and reflection\n* academic on-line learning\n* face to face training events. We offer places for Primary phase teacher training in Dorset through the School Direct route into teaching. This means our trainees are mainly school based during their training year. The intensive and immersive classroom experience helps to build teaching skills, supported by an experienced classroom teacher and in-school mentor. Alongside the practical experience, our trainees regularly come together for our 20 day taught programme. This covers all aspects of teaching and learning, and of the curriculum. There is a strong emphasis on understanding special educational needs and positive behaviour management. The programme is designed and led by outstanding school practitioners, giving trainee teachers practical training and advice based on classroom experience\nIn addition, our trainees are students of the University of Exeter who award Qualified Teacher Status and the Post Graduate Certificate of Education to trainees on successful completion of the training year. Trainees are allocated a day each week for their academic studies with the university, studying at home or in school.","trainWithDisability":"We work with our trainees as individuals in order to ensure they can access the programme and are effectively supported in school, whatever their needs.
