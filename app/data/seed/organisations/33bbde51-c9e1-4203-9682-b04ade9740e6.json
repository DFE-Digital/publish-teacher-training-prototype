It provides high quality, school-based experience and training in partnership with Somerset SCITT. The course will provide Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and a Post Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE). The School Direct Consortium aims to create a pathway of the highest quality training and possible succession opportunities for trainees within its partner schools. The School Direct training programme is for high quality graduates who want to train as part of a school team from day one. We offer placements across the Early Years and Primary phase from Nursery to Year 6. In addition, applicants with an interest in training within a Special School setting may be able to do so from September 2022.\nOur pupils are happy, enthusiastic and reflective learners who are at the heart of everything we do. Many pupils out-perform their peers nationally and make significantly more progress; pupils' attainment at the end of the FS and Key Stages 1 and 2 are above national averages. Our teachers are excellent practitioners who are eager to share their skills, knowledge and practice with the next generation of teachers. The schools have a history of collaborative team work, working together on areas such as Curriculum Design, assessment and English and form a strong and supportive partnership. Full details can be found on the Golden Valley Primary School (Nailsea) website.","trainWithDisability":"The 'Growing Expert Teachers' School Direct Programme is inclusive and welcomes applications from potential trainees who may have a disability or other need. \n\nA previous dyslexic trainee was given additional support and had certain allowances made, for example, extensions to assignment deadlines.
