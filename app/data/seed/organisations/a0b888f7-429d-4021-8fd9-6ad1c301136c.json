Successful applicants all know where their main school placements will be in July.","trainWithDisability":"SCITT: We support all trainees based on their individual needs. Working with our providers this has included those with dyslexia, physical, hearing and visual impairments and mental health conditions. Plans are developed with trainees to ensure that they can fully access in centre training, operate effectively on school placement and complete written assignments.\nAll of our providers have full disabled access as do all the schools in the partnership. However, applicants who would benefit from disabled access should let us know on their application so that they can be considered for placements at the most appropriate schools. UEA: UEA operates an equal opportunities policy and welcomes applications from people with disabilities. All PGCE trainee teachers must meet the Secretary of State's requirements for physical and mental fitness to teach. All candidates offered a place are required to complete an Occupational Health questionnaire. If this reveals any additional needs, UEA will consider reasonable adjustments at the University and in school placements\n[Find out more about the information and advice available through UEA's Wellbeing Service]https://portal.uea.ac.uk/student-support-service/wellbeing","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"accreditedBodies":[],"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:51:03.268Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-24T19:27:15.386Z"}
