Our purpose is to improve the education and life chances of young people by mitigating disadvantage for both the students and the communities we serve.\n\nWe believe that every student should have the opportunity to fulfil their academic potential and to become resilient individuals who are able to positively contribute to society. To achieve this, we need passionate, dedicated teachers who share our vision and have been equipped with the knowledge and skills to provide the best educational offer possible. \n\nNMITTP’s unique training programme ensures that our trainees are comprehensively prepared to translate this vision into reality in the classroom. \n\nWithin our partnership, we currently work with three secondary and six primary schools in Manchester, each of which offer high quality mentoring and support.\n\nNMITTP achieved an Ofsted rating of ‘Good’ in all areas in our last inspection in 2017.","trainWithDisability":"All successful candidates are entitled to a health check which enables NMITTP to create bespoke support packages for our ITTs.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:47:11.695Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-30T20:24:51.035Z"}
