We believe passionately in the school based route into teaching and are dedicated to using our knowledge, skills and expertise to train the next generation of teachers. We are fortunate to be able to offer a wide variety of host schools including first, middle schools and high schools. In our schools trainees feel valued and supported. They have access to a high quality training programme and engage in a wide variety of experiences. Each trainee is assigned a mentor, carefully selected for their ability to develop the practice of new entrants to the profession, allowing them to fulfil their potential to become outstanding practitioners.","trainWithDisability":"We will make any reasonable adjustments to accommodate and support all candidates, including those with additional needs.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"},"accreditedBodies":[],"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:52:59.490Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-07T15:44:33.513Z"}
