Knutsford Academy is the Lead School for this programme and we are complemented and supported by schools within our Trust and other leading schools in the region for additional home school and alternative placements.\nTT@K is a combination of school based teaching experience with a university-facilitated professional studies programme, delivered through The Learning Alliance rather than at the University itself. This is, in many ways, beneficial to our trainees since University lecturers and school–based leaders and specialists deliver side by side, enabling trainees to hear about current practice in schools, and underpinning practice with educational theory. The Professional Studies lecture and seminar programme delivered within The Learning Alliance is the core part of the PGCE element of our programme. Our training programme develops outstanding and inspirational teachers with an in-depth knowledge and understanding in delivering excellence in teaching and learning.\nOur Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) with Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) provides an in-depth training programme, focused on delivering the skills, knowledge and attributes needed when embarking on your teaching career.
