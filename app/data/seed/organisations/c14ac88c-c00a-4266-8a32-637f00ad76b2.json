Since then, we have established strong alliances with other schools across the North East. The lead school is Town End Academy, which is an outstanding school in Sunderland and part of WISE Academies which incorporates a number of schools across the North East.\n\nChildren are at the forefront of everything that TETSA do. In order to secure the best outcomes for pupils, we support staff at all stages of their career to grow and be part of schools which provide an excellent all-round education to every child.\n\nIn partnership with several schools, in a range of different contexts, the alliance is committed to creating partnerships that will improve teaching and learning in our own schools and beyond.","trainWithDisability":"Town End Teaching and Support Alliance is an inclusive provider.
