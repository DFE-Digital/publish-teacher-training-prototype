The Training & Support Alliance is made up from the three primary schools in the city, each with outstanding reputations for excellence. These are Whitehall Primary School in Easton, Bridge Farm Primary School in Whitchurch & the Ashley Down Schools' Federation. Two of the head teachers are designated as National Leaders of Education (NLEs) who support other schools across the city and beyond. The Training & Support Alliance has a strong reputation and proven track record of delivering training to leaders, leadership teams, teachers and trainees, which makes a lasting difference to teaching, leadership and classroom practice. We have links with more than 80 of Bristol's primary schools and work closely with many schools and head teachers in the city.\nIn 2021 - 2022 we are training 26 teachers of the future through the School Direct PGCE route in schools across the city. We work hard to ensure that your training year works for you, and pride ourselves on working closely with every trainee, mentor and school. We offer a unique and high-quality learning experience to prepare you fully for your future career in teaching. We have an invested interest in ‘growing our own’ teachers, spotting talent and raw potential in local schools, and our communities, then coaching and nurturing trainee teachers towards employment in local schools as excellent practitioners.\nFor more information, please visit our website (https://bptsa.org/)","trainWithDisability":"Disability Access\n\nAll schools and the university have disabled access.
