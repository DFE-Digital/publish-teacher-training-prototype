They have a good social life as well! \n\nTrainees also gain experience in local Partner Primary Schools, with a focus on transition, and in Partner Special Schools for additional experience with either: behavioural, medical or severely disabled pupils.\n\nWe do not differentiate between our School Direct and SCITT (i.e. the Doncaster ITT Partnership), as to us they are the same.\n\nWe also charge less than most other providers for a QTS only course, as we appreciate the need to keep costs down. We can do this because we are a genuinely schools-led partnership between the Local Authority, Teaching School Hub and partner schools and academies.","trainWithDisability":"All training venues and schools must meet statutory requirements for access, but individual needs will be accommodated wherever possible.","showSchoolPlacements":"no","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"accreditedBodies":[{"id":"762ad8a4-41ad-495b-aff1-37a53aebe264","code":"D51","name":"Doncaster ITT Partnership","description":"We aren't just ‘partnered’ with the Doncaster ITT Partnership, our Alliance of Schools is the Secondary side of the Partnership, working alongside our Primary Colleagues, Teaching School Hub and LA colleagues.\\r\\n\\r\\nBased in Doncaster Council, the Partnership is Ofsted Inspected and has been successfully delivering Schools-based ITT in Doncaster since 2003.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Partnership is the ONLY DfE Accredited ITT Provider in Doncaster and is one of only 5 in the whole of South Yorkshire!"}],"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:52:03.858Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-21T21:59:20.290Z"}
