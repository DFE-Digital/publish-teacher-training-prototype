Recently this has included those with dyslexia, physical, hearing and visual impairments and mental health conditions. Plans are developed with trainees to ensure that they can fully access in centre training, operate effectively on school placement and complete written assignments.\nSuffolk & Norfolk Primary SCITT training venues in Ipswich and Norwich have full disabled access as do partnership schools. However, applicants who would benefit from disabled access should let us know on their application so that they can be considered for placements at the most appropriate schools.\nThe Cambridge Teaching Schools Network (CTSN) feels that teachers with disabilities make an important contribution to schools both in the classroom and in shaping the wider culture and ethos of schools in which they work. If you have special requirements, and you are invited to attend an interview, please let CTSN know beforehand so reasonable adjustments can be made. CTSN wants all interview candidates to have an equitable and enjoyable experience, regardless of any disability. All trainees are required to complete a medical check when they receive the offer of a training place. This will identify if adjustments are required. As a training provider, CTSN will make such adjustments in its training. Trainees are encouraged to disclose all relevant information with placement schools to enable them to make suitable provision. If you receive an offer, but have not yet disclosed a disability or other need, you can disclose at any time.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"accreditedBodies":[{"id":"89831af6-535f-471b-aa97-098bd1a93291","code":"S13","name":"Suffolk and Norfolk Primary SCITT","description":"The Suffolk and Norfolk Primary SCITT programme is a personalised, relational and ethical training provider.
