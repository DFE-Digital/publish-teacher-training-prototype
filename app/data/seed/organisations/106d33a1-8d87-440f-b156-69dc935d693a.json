This covers all aspects of teaching life including behaviour management skills, planning and assessment, subject knowledge, professional enrichment, SEND, inclusion, pastoral care and a wide range of pedagogy. All students have the opportunity to work closely with an experienced, trained mentor and will become part of the school ethos from the first day of entry.\n\n100% of students we have trained agreed that if they were to do it again, it would be with us!","trainWithDisability":"Chipstead Valley Primary has an Enhanced Learning Provision Unit (ELP) for pupils on site, which means that we have full accessibility for those with physical disabilities (ramps, wheelchair access, refuge areas, lifts etc).\nWe can provide modified materials for those with dyslexia or visual impairments and are happy to support all other disabilities in any way necessary.
