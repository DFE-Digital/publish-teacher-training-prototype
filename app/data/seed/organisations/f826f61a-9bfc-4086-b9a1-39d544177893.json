We have built strong links so that our children are able to work and learn in the wider local environment and help to contribute to the area in which they live.","trainWithDisability":"As a lead school we have the facilities and the expertise to support applicants with a range of disabilities and would encourage those interested in becoming a teacher to get in contact.\nTeaching London: LDBS SCITT has a degree of step-free access, but as the building was a Victorian school, we are unable to fully accommodate wheelchair access. We are always willing to discuss, and where possible, adapt to meet individual needs.\nThe well-being of our trainees is paramount, which is why you will be automatically enrolled into the Employee Assistance Programme with the Education Support Partnership. This provides 24/7 individual support and counselling, in addition to our in-house advice and support.\nWe also have experience in supporting trainees with a diagnosis of dyslexia and are able to offer specialist support on the course.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"accreditedBodies":[{"id":"720894da-360a-4f7a-9835-7ce7beb3c6de","code":"L59","name":"Teaching London: LDBS SCITT","description":"An Outstanding provider (Ofsted: 2017), Teaching London puts pupils at the heart of your training.
