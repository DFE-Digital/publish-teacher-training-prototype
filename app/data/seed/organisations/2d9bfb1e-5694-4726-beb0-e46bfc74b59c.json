We work in close partnership with York St John University (https://blog.yorksj.ac.uk/ite/pgce-primary-education/) to deliver high quality teacher training and education which leads to a PGCE with QTS. At the last Ofsted inspection inspectors rated the partnership as ‘highly respected in our region, with outstanding leaders who have clear vision, relentless drive and well targeted actions.

The university provides strong institutional support for initial teacher education’.","trainWithDisability":"York St John University is an inclusive university and has a range of support services for students with disabilities and other needs.
