Courses are taught and supported by exceptional and dynamic staff, all of whom foster creativity, collaboration, innovation and student engagement at the heart of what they offer. We value the link between the academic and the practice, and this will form a significant part of the ITT programme you undertake.\n\nWe offer PGCE routes into teaching as well as School Direct Salaried and Non Salaried, and the Post Graduate Teacher Apprenticeship. We also have two undergraduate courses to consider that lead to QTS - BA Primary Education and BSc Computer Science and Education.\n\nOur end of programme survey outcomes, suggest that over 95% of our teacher trainees rate the quality of their training through UEL as good or higher. Employability is also excellent with most subjects, phases and routes achieving 95-100% employment each year. \n\nUEL is an inclusive university and our teacher training programmes are highly diverse and multicultural. We are very proud of our trainee teachers, new and old, and what they have gone on to achieve in our schools. We are especially proud of the community we serve and how we take people from the local community who then go back into this community to teach - over 50% of our trainees find jobs within our partner schools each year. \n\nWe look forward to welcoming you to UEL and the School of Education and Communities.","trainWithDisability":"Applications from students with disabilities or other specific needs are welcomed. Initial teacher training programmes are based at our Stratford campus, which is fully accessible to all. UEL operates a very clear inclusivity policy. As a large provider of ITT, we have access to various support mechanisms for students who need this or would benefit from this additional support.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"},"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:56:52.985Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-21T14:54:45.087Z"}
