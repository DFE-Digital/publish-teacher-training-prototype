We were awarded Silver for Teaching Excellence in 2017. In August 2018 we won an [Advance HE’s Collaborative Award for Teaching Excellence](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/news-and-views/ntfs-cate-announcement-2018) which recognises and rewards collaborative work that has had a demonstrable impact on teaching and learning across the University as a whole. We were the University of the Year for Graduate Employment in The Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide 2018 and in 2019. In [The Guardian University league tables 2019]( https://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2018/may/29/university-league-tables-2019) our undergraduate Education courses were in the UK top 10 for graduate level jobs or further professional or higher education study after 6 months.\nCourses at LSBU have a particular focus on social justice and equality. This focus is well matched to addressing the needs of schools in urban and multicultural areas. We strongly welcome applications from members of Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities, as we are keen to ensure the teaching workforce is more representative of London's diverse population.","trainWithDisability":"We’re committed to removing barriers to your learning and enabling you to get the most out of your time at LSBU.
