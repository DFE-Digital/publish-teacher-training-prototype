Once recruited, trainees will work both collaboratively and independently and there is a strong focus on individual support. Trainees engage with their school from the beginning of September, developing relevant professional skills from the wealth of experience that exists within the schools and the University. Trainees can access experience in post 16 and special school establishments as part of their training.\nExpectations are very high and the learning environment is fun, yet challenging. High quality one-to-one guidance and support will be available for trainees to become exceptional teachers.","trainWithDisability":"Hereteach is committed to advancing equality and celebrating diversity, so we can talk about your specific needs at any time before and during the course.
