Our student teachers will be ‘the village’ it takes ‘to raise a child’. Training more teachers than anyone else in the region (HESA, 2016), we educate Birmingham, teaching generations of professionals to teach generations of young people.\n\nWe’re top 20 in the UK for our undergraduate education courses (Guardian League Tables 2021). Our courses are taught by staff who are experienced professionals and maintain links with their sector to ensure you get the most up-to-date learning during your course. Many are research active, contributing to scholarship in education, childhood and youth.\n\nPlacements form two-thirds of our PGCE courses, giving you the opportunity to get hands-on and apply and grow your skills in some of our many partnership schools, ensuring you gain experience in a variety of educational settings so that you’re ready for employment when you graduate. We’re located at our City South Campus in Edgbaston, which has recently had a £41 million extension giving us excellent specialist facilities.\n\nOur aim for when you graduate is that you can think for yourself, critically and reflectively determining what’s best, not what’s easiest. Our graduates are very employable, with many taking jobs in the West Midlands. \n\nJoin us and let us empower you to inspire future generations.","trainWithDisability":"The University aims to provide an accessible environment and a range of support services to enable disabled students to participate fully in all\nactivities of the University. We believe a person is only disabled when confronted by negative attitudes and environmental barriers. We are working towards creating a positive, supportive and inclusive learning\nenvironment across all the University’s sites and faculties.\n\nOur Student Affairs team offers support and advice for prospective and current students with physical or sensory disabilities, specific learning difficulties (e.g. dyslexia), autism or chronic medical conditions. They also provide information about additional funding such as Disabled Students’ Allowances, run a Personal Assistance Scheme and offer a dyslexia screening and diagnostic service.\n\nOur campus is fully accessible with accessible toilets (having hoists), hearing loops in lecture theatres and networked assistive technology including Claro Read and Inspiration. In addition, we have PCs at our City South Campus which are designed to support students who may have difficulties with reading and writing, featuring specialised software with zooming/magnification and screen reading capabilities, which may also be customised for individual student needs.\n\nFor further information and advice, please visit: www.bcu.ac.uk/student-affairs","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"},"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:52:49.129Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-09T18:52:06.649Z"}
