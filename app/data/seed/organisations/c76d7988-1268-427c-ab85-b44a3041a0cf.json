We value diversity and the unique contribution that all their staff and trainees bring. If you have a disability, you shouldn’t be dissuaded from applying – we’ve put together some information on the support available while you train to teach. It’s a personal choice if you want to inform your school and/or university of your disability. The advantage of disclosure is that it enables support and reasonable adjustments to be put in place. In addition, specialist equipment, extra funding and support, can help you achieve your ambition of becoming a teacher.\nThe Equality Act 2010 and Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001, requires teacher training providers to ensure they are not discriminating against applicants with disabilities or special educational needs (SEN). We comply fully with this legislation\nThe Equality Act 2010 also sets out that disability is a ‘protected characteristic’. This means we will work with you to make reasonable adjustments. Common reasonable adjustments include:\nmaking modifications to buildings where possible\noffering flexible working hours\nproviding specialist equipment","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"accreditedBodies":[],"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:47:53.727Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-13T17:16:54.520Z"}
