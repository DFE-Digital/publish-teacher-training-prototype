During their time at Somers Park, we enjoy seeing our learners grow into independent thinkers who have a thirst for learning and great enjoyment of school. This comes as a result of an interesting and progressive curriculum delivered by skilled and caring teaching and support staff.\nOur Think. Know. Explain. Do. curriculum model flows through the school. Children are encouraged to challenge their own ideas and those of others, experiment and explore, they engage with experiences which support and develop the whole child.\nWe have enjoyed a highly successful partnership with The University of Worcester; 100% of our School Direct trainees have achieved 'Outstanding' (70%) or 'Good' grades. Our partner schools have been carefully selected and provide further experiences and opportunities to ensure you are fully prepared to successfully gain employment and take on responsibility for your own classes at the conclusion of the course.\nYou will work closely with, and be mentored by, an experienced high quality classroom teacher - we have received many comments from students on the high quality of mentoring and coaching they have received. We are split across two contrasting sites meaning a large supportive team and a wealth of experience.\nIf you require more information about the training programme or school, please contact the Deputy Head, Laura Edkins, ledkins@metacademies.org.uk","trainWithDisability":"At Somers Park, we are committed to ensuring equality of opportunity for all pupils, staff, parents and carers irrespective of race, gender, disability, belief, sexual orientation, age or socio-economic background, in line with the Equality Act 2010.\nSupport is given to students, when needed, with both academic and pastoral needs.
