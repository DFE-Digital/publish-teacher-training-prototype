The SCITT is committed to actively promoting equal opportunities in employment and to encouraging participation by disabled people in public life. If you would describe yourself as having a disability, in accordance with the Equality Act (2010), and need any adjustments made to promote equality of opportunity, please contact us, as soon as possible, so we can discuss your requirements. The best place for you to do this is on your UCAS form. However, you can also do it at any time during your studies, either by telling a member of SCITT Management.
