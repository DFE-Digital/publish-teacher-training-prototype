At St Bernard's School Direct Training we feel we have a responsibility to provide equality of access to the training programme as well as ensuring applicants have the health and physical capacity to teach. Every individual will have different circumstances and needs and so it is impossible to generalise about the likely impact a disability could have on a potential teaching career. For this reason it is important that you get in touch with St Bernard's School Direct Training early on into the process to discuss any special arrangements you may need, and to explore the options.\nSt Bernard's partners with The Sheffield SCITT who has a ‘Reasonable Adjustments Policy and Procedure’. This underpins our approach and is available on request by emailing kmcardle@sbch.org.uk","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"accreditedBodies":[],"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:56:56.993Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-04T16:32:41.770Z"}
