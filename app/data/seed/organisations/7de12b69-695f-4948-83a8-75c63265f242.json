They ask trainees to tell us how their disability may affect their learning and any adjustments they needed in order to access their studies.\n\nThese requests, with trainees' permission, are passed on to the relevant tutors, lecturers and schools so that they can accommodate all needs.\nTrainees can contact the School of Education's AccessAbility Tutor and the University's AccessAbility Centre for further advice or to report a problem.\n\nSome examples of how we support trainees with disabilities include:\n\n* Accessible school placements provided for trainees with a physical disability.\n* Tutors who are sensitive to the needs of trainees with mental health difficulties.\n* Slide presentations and resources are made available to all trainees at least 24 hours before a session takes place.\n* The AccessAbility Centre provides after hours appointments for PGCE trainees who are on placement and unable to attend during the day.\n* Disabled parking permits are provided to enable trainees with physical disabilities to park close to university buildings.\n* A variety of lesson planning templates is discussed with trainees with dyslexia to identify one that meets their needs and aids progression.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"yes","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"},"accreditedBodies":[{"id":"3e6c62a3-5d34-4a91-9c23-01c7409fd909","code":"L34","name":"University of Leicester","description":"The School of Education at the University of Leicester has a long and successful history of teacher training and a strong reputation for producing graduate teachers prized by schools.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe School of Education offers a PGCE via the School Direct training route, working in a close and collaborative relationship with Northamptonshire Teaching School Hub at Brooke Weston, so that our trainees benefit from the wealth of experience at the university and achieve consistently high quality outcomes."},{"id":"d4a65e61-defa-4861-b837-17ef2a1157c7","code":"N38","name":"University of Northampton","description":"The University of Northampton has over forty years of successful experience in initial teacher training, education and research.
