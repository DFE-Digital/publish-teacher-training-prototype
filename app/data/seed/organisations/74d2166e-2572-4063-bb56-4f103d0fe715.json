We know that trainees have a range of needs and we do everything in our power to ensure that they are successful. If a trainee has a disability or other needs we will create a plan to support them to ensure that they have full access to the training and support that we provide. This may be by making reasonable adjustments to deadlines, one-to-one coaching or more support where it is needed. We are a fully inclusive school that is committed to the success of all our students, staff and trainees, no matter what their starting point.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"accreditedBodies":[],"createdAt":"2021-10-12T20:57:02.605Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-18T21:09:08.467Z"}
