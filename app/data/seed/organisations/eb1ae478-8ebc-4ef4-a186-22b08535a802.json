Here at BGU we recognise that trainees may require additional assistance to engage fully with their studies due to a range of access needs. Student Advice plays a key role in co-ordinating services available to BGU’s disabled and sensory impaired students, and/or with specific learning differences or other access needs before and during their studies. In order to assess the level of support trainees may require, we use the legal definition of disability, which is wide ranging but includes:\n* Specific learning differences including dyslexia\n* Physical mobility difficulties\n* Hearing impairments\n* Visual impairments\n* Persons requiring personal care\n* Autistic Spectrum Disorders including Asperger’s Syndrome\n*Mental health difficulties\n* Medical conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes or asthma\nPlease note that this is not an exhaustive list – trainees may have access needs that are not listed above. If you are unsure whether you have access needs which are covered by disability legislation, please contact Student Advice – we will be happy to offer advice and guidance.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"accreditedBodies":[],"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:48:04.551Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-08T23:17:09.039Z"}
