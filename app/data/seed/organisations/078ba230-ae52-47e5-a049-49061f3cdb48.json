If you choose to train with Liverpool College and Birkdale High School Direct Alliance, you will participate in the PGCE programme offered by Liverpool Hope University, having your subject training delivered by Liverpool Hope tutors except in Classics which will be delivered by Classics teachers from Liverpool College, whilst your professional development will be provided in both Liverpool College and Birkdale High School by experienced teachers from the two schools. You will also have the opportunity to take part in PGCE conferences and other events organised by Liverpool Hope University. We feel that this mixture gives our trainees the best of both worlds – practical training led by professionals who really know the challenges of school life married with high quality academic input and the opportunity to mix with trainees from across the city region at Liverpool Hope University.","trainWithDisability":"X","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"accreditedBodies":[],"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:47:44.481Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-16T18:23:28.459Z"}
