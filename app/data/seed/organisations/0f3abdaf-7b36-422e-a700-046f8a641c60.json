Our management team, academic tutors, subject leaders and school-based mentors strive to ensure the best possible outcomes for all student teachers. Prior to the start of the course all student teachers undertake a health and physical capacity to teach check. \n\nFor those with additional learning needs, every student teacher receives bespoke support from a dedicated academic tutor who can provide support with assignment writing. Students can also access additional support through Student Finance's Disabled Learning Allowance Scheme. \n\nWe carefully select placement schools for those with physical needs to optimise any reasonable adjustments that may be required. Mentors and subject leaders can provide support to those with visual and hearing difficulties to develop impairment-friendly strategies within the classroom.\n\nOur personalised approach to learning allows those with mental health needs to develop their practice with support from the central management team. We offer an empathetic dialogue to provide an appropriate balance of support and challenge throughout the programme.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:56:16.957Z","updatedAt":"2021-08-05T17:01:49.587Z"}
