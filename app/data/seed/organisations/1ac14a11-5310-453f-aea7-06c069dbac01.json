We are proud to be recognised as a supportive partnership. Our schools, located across Devon, are highly aspirational and are committed to sharing very best practice and provide the highest quality of teaching and learning for our children. Collaboration is at the heart of our teaching training model. Fundamental to our principle is the development of excellent teachers and high-quality leaders. Through the development of ‘Leaders of Learning’ in every classroom and sustainable leadership within and across schools, we will be able to contribute to the growth of a world class education system. We believe that every child has the right to be taught by excellent teachers in excellent schools that nurtures, challenges and supports their potential. Our School Direct Partnership is an exciting training route for top graduates, in partnership with Plymouth Marjon University. Our programme uses a variety of school-based settings, enabling trainees to experience a wide range of learning environments and contexts. This ensures that trainees are fully prepared to take up posts in schools. We are offering School Direct places for those interested in teaching in EYFS, General Primary, Primary with Mathematics, Primary with English and Primary with SEND. Our programme awards both QTS and PGCE on successful completion. It is expected that as a reflective, highly developed, early career teacher, you will secure employment in one of our partner schools.","trainWithDisability":"We are very aware of, and sympathetic to, disabilities and different individual needs that the trainees may have and we work with our ITT partner to ensure that opportunities are the same for all.\nDisability and needs disclosure: If you have an illness or a disability which you think may benefit from support from the partnership, we encourage you to disclose this to your mentor.
