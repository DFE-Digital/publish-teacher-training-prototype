In addition to the time, resources and strategies provided by Course Tutors, trainees are encouraged and supported to apply for the Disabled Student Allowance. This is used to fund further study support which is organised with external agencies, such as Contacts Associates.\nDescribing the accessibility of the course as “amazing”, a trainee with autism commented that she “really enjoyed the course and [was] incredibly impressed with how adaptable and efficient it has been”. (Corrine, former trainee)\nThe course is highly personalised and supportive. Each trainee has a Personal Tutor (either the Director or Deputy Director) to provide pastoral and professional support throughout the course. This approach enables us to cater for individual needs with speed and flexibility, and is a key strength of the course. “The pastoral and professional support of DPSCITT staff is amazing, and a stand out feature of the course.” (Alannah, former trainee)\nRegular 1:1 meetings are timetabled with Personal Tutors to discuss each trainee’s needs and wellbeing, and trainees are encouraged to seek further support when necessary. Each week, School-based Tutors provide quality time to support each trainee, planning and coordinating their individual training programme. “Learning Conversations … are at the heart of this outstanding training programme. Skilled DPSCITT and school-based staff ensure each conversation is personal to that trainee and focused on their specific learning successes and areas for development.” (Ofsted, 2016)","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:48:18.170Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-06T21:11:45.374Z"}
