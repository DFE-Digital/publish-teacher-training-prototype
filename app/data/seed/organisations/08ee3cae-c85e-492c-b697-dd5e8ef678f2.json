We have an extensive proven track record in training students to become outstanding teachers. Our main ITT pathway is the School Direct with QTS & PGCE route with in excess of 80 places advertised in 15 different curriculum areas across the Wood Green ITT Alliance for 2022-23. It has always been our philosophy as a Lead School to give teacher training applicants the opportunity to specifically apply for the training school/campus of their choice; you are therefore able, from the start, to select your preferred training school. It is our belief that the opportunity to mutually assess both enhances the training experience and produces the best outcomes. Wood Green Academy has a long-standing reputation for achieving some of the best GCSE and Post 16 results in the local area, and in February 2020, under the new Ofsted framework, achieved an overall effectiveness rating of good. Furthermore, it is only one of few secondary schools nationally that achieved the grade of outstanding for behaviour and attitudes, something we are extremely proud of.\nOur subject mentors are extremely committed to your development and their vast experience will guide you to success. Wood Green ITT Alliance school direct trainees will benefit from a precious extra layer of support compared to core PGCE trainees. Our Alliance of schools enables more convenient arrangements for second school placements and greater opportunities for employment after the completion of your training.","trainWithDisability":"Wood Green ITT Alliance is committed to supporting applicants with disabilities and special needs.
