Our Partnership is based at and managed by the Lead School, Davenant Foundation School, in Loughton, Essex, and recruits for 23 secondary and 8 primary schools in the West Essex, Harlow, Havering and Chelmsford areas. All of our Partner schools are judged ‘Outstanding’ or ‘Good’ by Ofsted. Our unique blended learning programme combines school based training, on-line learning materials, a network of experienced subject specialists to deliver pedagogy, subject knowledge and off-site visits to special schools, primary schools and Leading Teacher days. All schools in our Partnership have a successful track record of working with trainee teachers and university PGCE providers. Each school provides trainees with a fully trained mentor, supported by a Pathway Tutor (subject specialist) from TES Institute who visits each half-term to monitor progress and to “Quality Assure” our programme. Our route has provided consistent employment for trainees within the Partnership on completion of their training. In the last 3 years, the vast majority of our trainees had been employed before the end of the course, almost all of these in the schools where they had trained.\nSuccessful applicants gain Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and most choose to complete a PGCE.\nWe provide excellent role models from within the teaching staff and opportunities to observe ‘outstanding teaching’. Each school aspires to engender an ‘appetite for learning’ within its pupil community, both in the classroom and within the range of extra-curricular activities it provides.","trainWithDisability":"TES Institute and Essex School Direct are committed to promoting access for people with disabilities and additional needs.
