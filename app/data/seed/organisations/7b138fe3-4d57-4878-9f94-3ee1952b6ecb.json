During the last academic year 100% of our students secured a teaching post within a special school. Training will allow you to develop a strong specialism in SEND.\nYou will be based in school for the full academic year with placements in two different settings. The first placement will be in a mainstream school in the Bradford area. The second placement will be in one of our primary special schools within Bradford. This provides greater experience and teaching practice, builds confidence and classroom excellence and will equip you well for the reality of your NQT year. The Yorkshire Special Education Partnership will provide a supportive and caring environment in which to train. All the partner schools involved in this programme have a strong inclusive ethos that cascades through all they do.","trainWithDisability":"We’re committed to ensuring that every student with potential, regardless of their background or circumstances, has the opportunity to benefit from higher education.
