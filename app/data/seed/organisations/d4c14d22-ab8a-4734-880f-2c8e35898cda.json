Our schools enjoy a highly valued reputation locally, many oversubscribed due to the competitive, high-performing profile of our borough. Student behaviour is generally excellent and results show that many students consistently out-perform their national peers.","trainWithDisability":"All school direct students have full access to the student services in our university provider partners. This includes support services for students with a range of physical and mental health needs. Their campuses have full disability access.\nStudents may also access well-being and counselling services and support services for specific learning needs, including dyslexia and dyspraxia, through academic achievement advisers.\nThe Institute of Education has a nursery available (run by University College London). However, for student teachers we recommend you look into childcare options near your place of residence or host teaching school. Our partner universities also offer accommodation for student teachers, although it may be better to find accommodation near placement schools.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"accreditedBodies":[],"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:53:44.503Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-04T18:37:36.238Z"}
