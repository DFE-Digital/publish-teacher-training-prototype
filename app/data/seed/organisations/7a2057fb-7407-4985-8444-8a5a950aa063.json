It's lead and founding school is Impington Village College (IVC), part of the Morris Education Trust. It was originally founded in the late 1930s as part of the ‘village college’ movement and we remain true to this vision of community education and learning. In recent years IVC has consistently achieved outstanding outcomes for its students and GCSE results place it in the top 5% of non-selective schools nationally. All children are valued as equally and IVC has pioneered work with inclusion and SEND. Alongside IVC are our partners who represent a cross-section of like-minded yet diverse schools who are all deeply connected with the communities they serve. Personal, social and cultural development matters as much as academic achievement for us. As a trainee, you would be placed in welcoming and caring schools and mentored in your development by a team of staff with a wealth of experience. A large number of our placement schools are in North Cambridge, East Cambridgeshire and Fenland.\nMany of the teachers who now work in our schools also trained in them - a testament not only to the ethos, values and experience enjoyed here but also the attractiveness of living within the area.","trainWithDisability":"Training with disabilities and other needs.\nTeachers with disabilities make an important contribution to schools both in the classroom and in shaping the wider culture and ethos of the schools they work in. Schools value diversity and the unique contribution that all their staff and trainees bring. If you have a disability, you shouldn’t be dissuaded from applying. If you are invited to attend an interview, and have any special requirements, please let us know beforehand so that we may make reasonable adjustments for you. We want all interview candidates to have an equitable and enjoyable experience, regardless of any disability. Full details are on the Department for Education website.\nAll trainees are required to complete a medical check when they receive the offer of a training place. This will identify if there are adjustments required. As a training provider, CTSN will make such adjustments in our training. We encourage all trainees to disclose all relevant information with their placement schools as this will enable them to make suitable provision. Schools have experience of making provisions for their own students and are therefore well placed to offer similar adjustments for trainee teachers. If you receive an offer, but have not yet disclosed a disability or other need, you can disclose at any time.","accreditedBodies":[{"id":"16075b74-df88-4bcc-b3ce-6e42f63261d5","code":"1WO","name":"The Cambridge Teaching Schools Network, CTSN SCITT","description":"CTSN SCITT offers school-centred teacher training across the Eastern Region:\\r\\n* All applicants are able to choose whether they attend the Core Training in Cambridge or Bury St Edmunds.\\r\\n* There is a wide range of placement schools.\\r\\n* Most trainees get jobs working in local schools. \\r\\n* Course tutors are expert teachers, meaning that our training is not only evidence-based, but also informed by current practice. \\r\\n* Non salaried (tuition fee) routes lead to QTS plus PGCE (University of Greenwich or Anglian Ruskin University). \\r\\n* Salaried routes are also available, leading to QTS.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease see [ctsn.scitt.info](https://ctsnscitt.info) for more information."}],"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:53:36.135Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-22T02:02:33.577Z"}
