We are a large Alliance of local schools firmly committed to the philosophy of improving outcomes for the children in our schools. We understand that the best way to achieve this is through quality teaching and it is this belief that led us to establish our highly successful ITT programme which has run now since 2014. All placements are organised by YSTA staff and take place in schools within the Alliance. Trainees can expect to spend 80% of their time in class gaining practical experience on how to provide challenging and meaningful teaching and learning opportunities. To complement this, there is regular theory based training delivered by Lancashire's Senior Consultants and other experienced practitioners. Our training programme ensures that trainees gain the skills and experience needed to become fully qualified and highly effective teachers able to take up a post in either Key Stage 1 or Key Stage 2.","trainWithDisability":"The Yarrow Schools' Teaching Alliance is committed to treating all applicants fairly and with respect, irrespective of their actual or assumed background, disability or any other protected characteristic.
