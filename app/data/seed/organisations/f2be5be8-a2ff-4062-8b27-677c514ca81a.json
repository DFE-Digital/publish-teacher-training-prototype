We have previously successfully supported trainee teachers with Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, Autism, Mental Health conditions and a range of physical, hearing and visual impairments.\nAll candidates complete an online health questionnaire administered by the University's Occupational Health Department in the summer before beginning the course. This is to establish mental and physical fitness for teaching. Following this, if you have a disability or health condition, you are then advised to register with the University Student Support service and an assessment is arranged to establish your needs and to identify additional support and adjustments needed to help you be as successful as possible on the course. At all stages we strongly recommend trainees fully disclose their individual needs so a support package can be tailored to each individual.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"accreditedBodies":[{"id":"4d4cceab-1516-4a6c-a9ab-5de0e32e1fe1","code":"S90","name":"University of Sussex","description":"Offering a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) in Primary (ages 5-11) and Secondary (11-16) with specialisms in over eight subjects.
