We believe in developing thoughtful, self-confident teachers who are comfortable questioning everything around them whilst simultaneously having confidence in everything they do. We focus on school student learning right from the start of the PGCE and this encourages our trainees to develop very quickly as teachers. You will be well supported by subject experts in both school and University and welcomed into a warm and friendly PGCE team who will challenge you to become the best teacher that you can be. In our latest Ofsted Inspection (2017), the inspectors found that we:\n•\tAre passionate about, and committed to, ensuring that pupils in the local area and beyond are taught by highly skilled and knowledgeable teachers so that pupils’ outcomes improve quickly. •\tHave extremely strong relationships between school mentors, trainees and the University based tutors, which is underpinned by effective communication and ongoing support. •\tHelp trainees understand how pupils learn, which has a positive impact on pupil progress over time.
