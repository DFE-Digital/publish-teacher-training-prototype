This is a course of 120 credits at Level 6. In December, student teachers may apply to be registered on the Postgraduate Certificate In Education (PGCE-M) where up to 60 M-level credits can be gained from subsequent work. Therefore the PGCE-M will result in 60 credits at Level 6 and 60 at Level M. All students completing the School Direct course will also gain NQT (Newly Qualified Teacher) status.\nOur accredited provider is the University of Winchester which is recognised by Ofsted as an 'Outstanding' provider of teacher education at both primary and secondary level and has a long history of training teachers.\nEducation should be fun, awe-inspiring, life-changing and life-enhancing: it should be borrowed and nurtured by a generation to pass on boldly and proudly to the next.\nThis is the ethos that underpins the Rural Schools.","trainWithDisability":"We are committed to supporting pupils and staff with specific needs and are committed to creating a community that recognises and celebrates difference within a culture of respect and cooperation.
