As soon as you have agreed the ISLP it will be sent to your Disability Coordinator and then, with your agreement, passed on to the relevant academic and support staff.\nAll trainees are encouraged to disclose any specific learning need that they experience, in order to make any adjustments, both at your home school and LJMU.

This is designed to ensure that arrangements are in place, from the outset, to support any students who may need additional support or reasonable adjustments to be made.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"accreditedBodies":[{"id":"ec34b77c-cba3-4598-93be-23f0471adff1","code":"L51","name":"Liverpool John Moores University","description":"Our accredited body, Liverpool John Moores University has an established reputation for high quality Teacher Training.
