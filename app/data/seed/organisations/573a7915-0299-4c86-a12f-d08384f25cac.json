The schools that we work with value diversity and the unique contribution that all their staff and trainees bring. Therefore, applicants with disabilities and other needs are encouraged to apply. The School Direct Route makes the most of in-school mentoring, offering close support for trainees. We recognise that trainees may require additional assistance to engage fully with their studies due to a range of access needs. If you are unsure whether you have access needs which are covered by disability legislation, please contact us – we will be happy to offer advice and guidance.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"accreditedBodies":[{"id":"1d95b6cb-0e08-4485-848a-0e304d71102a","code":"B38","name":"Bishop Grosseteste University","description":"The accredited provider for the Queen Elizabeth’s Grammar School School Direct programme is Bishop Grosseteste University (BGU). \\r\\n\\r\\nBGU has been educating students in the historic heart of Lincoln for over 150 years.
