We are an innovative partnership, which is continually developing its approaches to training and pedagogy. We invest greatly in the professional development of all our staff and those who choose to train alongside us. The South East Learning Alliance is a relatively small Alliance, but we pride ourselves on ensuring personal and bespoke training opportunities for all our trainees, which is reflected in the excellent success and retention rates we have achieved over the last seven years. Our size has added to our ability to provide a full and comprehensive range of support and ensures a variety of opportunities to work across a wide plethora of demographics and institutions. Ensuring our trainees receive the right support; in the most appropriate setting possible, is at the forefront of our ethos.","trainWithDisability":"We will make every effort to support any disabilities or additional needs candidates may have.
