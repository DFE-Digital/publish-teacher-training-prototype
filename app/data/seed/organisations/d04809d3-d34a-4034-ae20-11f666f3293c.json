Disabilities are catered for on a case by case basis. Any trainee with an impairment or health condition (physical or mental), which may affect their ability to train to teach, will be referred to occupational health and any reasonable adjustments will be made for their training year. We acknowledge that some of you might find the academic side of the course a little challenging, especially if you have been out of full-time education for a while or suffer from dyslexia, and provide a range of support to cater for this. In addition, we have a mental heath and well-being lead who works with you throughout your training year.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:48:26.802Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-19T17:47:12.946Z"}
