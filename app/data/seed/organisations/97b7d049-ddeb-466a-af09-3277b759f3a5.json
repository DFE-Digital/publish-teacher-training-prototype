All our partner schools have the expertise to support applicants with learning disabilities.\nIf required, any Trainees with additional needs are given extra, appropriate support through our own Risk Assessment system. This is a confidential support mechanism, tailored to the needs of the individual.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:50:23.603Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-04T16:12:56.294Z"}
