It is a requirement to have taught a minimum of two key stages in your training year.\n\nA requirement of the course is that trainees complete two days in a primary school. This provides an invaluable insight into the importance of transition from primary to secondary. Trainees will be allocated a tutor group to gain an understanding of the importance of the pastoral role in education.\n\nThe year is designed to help trainees build up to the equivalent teaching requirements of an Early Career Teacher (ECT). Trainees will have a mentor in both a base school and second placement. The mentor is there for day-to-day support, help with planning and suggestions for university tasks, and will conduct regular observations and provide structured feedback. Trainees will have a University Link Tutor who will conduct visits during the year and provide feedback and support. \n\nOver the last 5 years, 100% of Rutland Teaching Alliance trainees* have been in employment contracts as NQTs by the end of the course . 98% of trainees starting the course gained QTS in the last 3 years (National 90%).\n \n* those actively seeking employment","trainWithDisability":"The Rutland and District Schools' Federation are committed to promoting equality and diversity, providing an inclusive and supportive environment for all.
