Our aim is to ensure that every pupil enjoys their time at St Andrew’s and develops a lively and enquiring mind. We value each and every child as an individual and encourage their unique development whilst emphasising the importance of respect, team work, responsibility and hard work.","trainWithDisability":"Teaching London: LDBS SCITT has a degree of step-free access, but as the building was a Victorian school, we are unable to fully accommodate wheelchair access. We are always willing to discuss, and where possible, adapt to meet individual needs.\nThe well-being of our trainees is paramount, which is why you will be automatically enrolled into the Employee Assistance Programme with the Education Support Partnership. This provides 24/7 individual support and counselling, in addition to our in-house advice and support.\nWe also have experience in supporting trainees with a diagnosis of dyslexia and are able to offer specialist support on the course.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"accreditedBodies":[{"id":"720894da-360a-4f7a-9835-7ce7beb3c6de","code":"L59","name":"Teaching London: LDBS SCITT","description":"https://www.teachinglondon.org/"}],"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:52:18.727Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-14T19:53:44.433Z"}
