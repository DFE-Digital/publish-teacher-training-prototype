We create an environment in which staff, pupils and trainee teachers all feel valued and supported and this leads to a school culture of enthusiasm, commitment and outstanding achievement.\nThe wider partnership of schools comprises a mixture of large and small, urban and rural, and both secondary and primary schools. We provide a unique opportunity to experience a diverse and contrasting range of teaching and training experiences.\nOur staff have a proven track record in providing training and professional development. All our trainees receive the highest level of continual support throughout the programme and beyond. This covers all aspects of teaching life from behaviour management skills, subject knowledge, professional enrichment, AEN, inclusion and pastoral care (we uphold a specific focus on workload and well being across our partnership).
