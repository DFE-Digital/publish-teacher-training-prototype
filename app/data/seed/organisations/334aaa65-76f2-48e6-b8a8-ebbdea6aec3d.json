We have a dedicated and well-equipped training room specifically reserved for our trainee teachers. This provides you with a quiet and secure base where you can work, meet to exchange ideas and experiences with others or simply make a coffee and have a biscuit.\nIn addition to providing the highest standards and quality of training, Cromwell also provides all trainees with a laptop and a dedicated continuing professional development library. In addition to the Professional Studies course provided by our partners at the University of Bedfordshire, Cromwell delivers bespoke in house training from an experienced team of teachers and leaders.
