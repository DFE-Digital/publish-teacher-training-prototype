We want to train the most ambitious, enthusiastic and committed graduates who aspire to make a difference to the life chances and education of children and have a rewarding and challenging career. They will embrace all the opportunities we offer at the beginning of their journey to becoming outstanding teachers.\nWe work closely with The Diamond Learning Partnership Trust (DLPT), comprising 14 schools in the St Neots, Fenland and Royston areas (see website). Our partner schools are a mixture of large and smaller town schools, and small village schools. Our pupils are at the heart of all we do. We are focussed on providing the perfect balance between an excellent education, uncompromising pastoral care and the nurtured development of every individual childâ€™s qualities. We believe our staff are our greatest asset, so we invest in them to ensure they also reach their full potential. Professional development of staff is a key priority.\nDuring your training, you will experience teaching in different settings to deepen your understanding of a range of educational contexts. A large proportion of your training will be in classrooms learning from enthusiastic, highly skilled and experienced mentors. All of our previous trainees have gained QTS status and been employed, 75% within the DLPT.","trainWithDisability":"We support any trainees with disabilities and other needs.
