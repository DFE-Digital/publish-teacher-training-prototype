It is particularly suited for candidates with relevant experience of working with children who are wishing to find teaching jobs for autumn 2020 in the local area, as our schools prioritise recruitment from the Springboard Cluster and recommend their students to other schools in the local area. Our graduates are very successful at finding jobs in Leeds due to the quality of the course, school links in the area and the track record of Leeds Beckett University, our higher education partner. The Springboard Cluster is situated in north Leeds primary schools. It is led by Shire Oak Primary School in Headingley. One advantage of the Springboard Cluster is the diversity of its members and therefore the contrasting teaching experiences that student teachers benefit from on their two placements and on our enhancement days. We have small schools, three form entry schools, schools with high numbers of EAL speakers, schools with a very varied socio-economic profile and different cultural backgrounds. All are schools that are committed to meeting the needs of their young learners and supporting the next generation of teachers to do the same. Each school has an experienced tutor/mentor as well as supportive classroom teachers.","trainWithDisability":"Although you do not have to disclose any disabilities to us, if you do it can help us to support you fully. This could include choosing mentors with the right experience to help you, adjusting your working hours and finding placements in the most accessible buildings or asking schools to make reasonable adjustments to their environment.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"accreditedBodies":[{"id":"154509e2-743e-4f0b-9d99-396393aa57ff","code":"L27","name":"Leeds Beckett University","description":"Leeds Beckett University are one of the leading teacher training providers in England with an excellent track record in training teachers. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn campus, close to the cluster, trainees study in their new Carnegie Teacher Education Building which includes spaces which mimic real-life nursery and primary school settings.
