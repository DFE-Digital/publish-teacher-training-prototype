A large number of these trainees have been employed by their school and have gone on to start our Newly Qualified Teacher (NQT)programme.\nSchool Direct offers both a fee-funded and a salaried path. The salaried path is an employment-based route for high quality graduates who will be employed as an unqualified teacher for the duration of their training and receive a salary. The salary is expected to reflect subject priorities with Physics, Maths, Chemistry, MFL and Computing attracting the higher salaries. Other subjects which would attract a bursary are listed on the School Direct website below.\nAs well as a degree all ITT applicants must have English and Mathematics at GCSE Grade C or above (as well a grade C or above for Science for Primary Education trainees). Getting classroom experience will help you decide whether teaching is right for you. We encourage applicants to visit our partnership schools to gain classroom experience. The experience will support your application but we must state that school experience is not essential and that we do welcome applications from all interested candidates.","trainWithDisability":"TES Institute and St Clere's are committed to promoting access for people with disabilities and additional needs.
