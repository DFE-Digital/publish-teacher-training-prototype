Our expert practitioners assist local primary and secondary schools to support pupils with a wide range of disabilities and special educational needs. This extends to our student teachers, who we work very closely with to enable them to succeed.\nAs a special school, the Equality Act 2010 & SEN Disability Act 2001 are very important to us. Our training facility is fully accessible for wheelchair users, and we have access to in-house Hearing and Visual Impairment Specialists who would be able to provide a detailed report to assist us with making the necessary adjustments to meet an individual's needs.\nWe have experience of supporting students with Dyslexia. Two of our Specialist Teachers and course lecturers are both accredited Dyslexia Specialists. We are able to work with students on access arrangements for skills testing and assignments, in addition to ensuring that they have the tools they need to achieve.\nAll student teachers are assigned a personal tutor. If you are experiencing any mental health problems, we would advise you to discuss this with your personal tutor so that the correct support can be arranged. If you feel that you may require additional support, or need help with access arrangements, then please do get in touch to discuss your individual requirements and find out how we can work together. Of course, applicants are under no obligation to disclose, however, we cannot support individual needs if we are not aware of them.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"accreditedBodies":[{"id":"76c55af9-5232-41bd-a308-9fc5a4270cdd","code":"P38","name":"Pennine Lancashire SCITT","description":"The Pennine Lancashire SCITT is an Initial Teacher Training provider run by four East Lancashire Schools: The Hollins, Marsden Heights, Ribblesdale and Tor View giving graduates the opportunity to receive practical teacher training and to learn ‘on the job’.
