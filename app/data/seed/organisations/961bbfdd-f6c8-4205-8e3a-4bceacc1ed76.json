You will find out how these experts are able to change children’s lives through their role and develop the skills required to start doing so yourself.\n\nOur course provides holistic training, covering the areas you need to feel completely prepared to enter your NQT classroom. You will cover keys stages 2 to 5 and have an in-depth knowledge of how the practices develop through these age ranges. You will complete 5 placements and spend 186 days training to become an effective and impactful teacher. During this time, you will earn both your QTS (Qualified Teaching Status) and PGCE (Post Graduate Certificate in Education) and develop your knowledge of how academic theory underpins your classroom practice. The course is tailored to your needs and you begin teaching when you are ready. This bespoke approach allows you the time required to embed the theory learned into your practice and explore how an effective teacher utilises cognitive science, pedagogical teaching strategies and experience to refine their teaching.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"yes","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"accreditedBodies":[{"id":"554ca5b2-7f5a-4a4a-b9a4-956bc1e880de","code":"L33","name":"Leicestershire Secondary SCITT","description":"Teachers Training Teachers and Changing Children’s Lives...\\r\\n\\r\\nLeicestershire Secondary SCITT is a school-based teacher training provider.
