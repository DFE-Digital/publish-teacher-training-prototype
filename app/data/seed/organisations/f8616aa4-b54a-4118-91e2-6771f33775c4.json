All academies within our trust work closely with each other as a ‘family of schools’. The trust as a whole is not a separate body or group of people, but rather one single organisation made up of all our academies with one single vision and shared set of values. We work together to ensure that all children, irrespective of their starting point, receive an excellent education. Whether you are a new graduate, about to graduate or you are considering a career change, our school direct initial teacher training courses, will provide you with the foundation you need for your career in teaching.\nOur School Direct Programme\nOur route offers trainees an extended professional practice placement in one main school, supplemented by an additional placement (around 6 weeks) in another ALP school. Trainees will also spend time at Durham SCITT working in their purpose built training centre with their team of subject specialists, attending general professional study sessions and following a programme of enhancements. This ensures an experience of teaching in different settings.","trainWithDisability":"At ALP we pride ourselves on the personal approach and fully support candidates with disabilities during the interview process and throughout the course.
