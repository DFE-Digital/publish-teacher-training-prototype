We provide breakfast and after school clubs and offer additional support for any vulnerable groups of pupils.","trainWithDisability":"Bannockburn is a partial access school: High Street: 1 disabled toilet and no access between floors.\nManor Way: 1 disabled toilet on each floor and a lift that goes to the first floor but not all floors. Candidates with particular requirements are encouraged to get in touch.\nTeaching London: LDBS SCITT has a degree of step-free access, but as the building was a Victorian school, we are unable to fully accommodate wheelchair access. We are always willing to discuss, and where possible, adapt to meet individual needs.\nThe well-being of our trainees is paramount, which is why you will be automatically enrolled into the Employee Assistance Programme with the Education Support Partnership. This provides 24/7 individual support and counselling, in addition to our in-house advice and support.\nWe also have experience in supporting trainees with a diagnosis of dyslexia and are able to offer specialist support on the course.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"accreditedBodies":[],"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:54:39.043Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-27T23:51:34.686Z"}
