Our partnership schools are ones in which well-being and the principles of inclusion matter. All schools in the partnership are dedicated to achieving equality of opportunity where access hinges not on treating trainees in the same way, but on taking positive action to redress the inequalities faced by some trainees.\nHavering Train2Teach schools are located across the borough in a variety of buildings, all with different facilities allowing for a suitable placement for trainees with disabilities to be found. We have been able to accommodate trainees with mobility issues who have needed to be located on a ground floor or who have had trouble standing for long periods of time. Practical adjustments to physical environments are part of each school’s accessibility plan and will be considered in individual cases.\nBy working closely with TES, reasonable variations can be made to allow access to the training plan and the delivery of information. Each new trainee has an initial need assessment (INA) which leads to a more individualised program for all.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"accreditedBodies":[],"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:47:09.818Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-22T15:16:42.353Z"}
