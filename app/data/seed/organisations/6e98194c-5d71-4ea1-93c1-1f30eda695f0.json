All disclosures are treated with sensitivity and confidentiality. Making a disclosure means that we then have the opportunity to put in the support you require to enable you to succeed and reach your full potential during your initial teacher training course.\nAll our schools are equal opportunities employers. Our schools are actively involved in implementing mental health and well-being strategies.
