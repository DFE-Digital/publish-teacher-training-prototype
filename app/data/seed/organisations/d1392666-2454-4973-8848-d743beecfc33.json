These lectures will address the Standards for QTS and Subject Knowledge for Teaching and will involve assessment through assignments.\nWhat's in it for you?

With the help of the various disability assessments provided we always have a clear picture of the needs of every individual at the start of their training and can then tailor our lectures to ensure that we address these needs. Being a relatively small provider this is never a problem and we are always available to discuss any issues moving forward. The Office Manager meets every week with trainees when they attend Professional Studies so there is always an opportunity to check well-being.","visaSponsorship":{"canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"},"createdAt":"2021-07-06T17:51:31.470Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-14T20:16:32.161Z"}
