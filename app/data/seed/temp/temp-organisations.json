For those with an interest in working in special education we are able to offer placements in a special school context within certain subjects.\n\nThe partnership schools in our alliance offer a range of experiences, working alongside happy and friendly children and hardworking and ambitious staff. All the schools have experience of teacher training and are able to coach and mentor trainees through the programme, producing good and outstanding trainees. In addition to what is offered by MMU, we provide an extensive CPD programme delivered by Local, National and Specialist Leaders of Education. \n\nWe are proud that all BSA Graduates secured employment for their NQT year and a large majority remain within Bury schools.

The range of subjects offered across the partnership is exceptional and shows our commitment to continued growth in both traditional and creative subjects, reflecting the diverse wants, needs and talents of our students There is a long and successful history of teacher training within the partnership through involvement with universities and ITT providers, but also through national partnerships in which the schools have directly contributed to the training programmes. This experience helps us meet the needs of all trainees, from ECTs to Senior Leaders engaged in national professional programmes. There is a strong tradition of 'grow your own' within the school, with many trainees continuing in situ after their training and quickly taking management positions within the schools.

As a conglomerate of schools, we have considerable experience training teachers and both recognise and value the contribution these practitioners make to our respective communities. We offer School Direct salaried and unsalaried teacher training routes across the full range of curriculum subjects. The training programme is structured to allow trainees to develop the skills required by teachers to teach the subject that they are training in and to develop specific expertise for making a distinctive contribution in their settings. A Subject and Teacher Mentor directs the development of subject knowledge for teaching in school settings. All schools within 'The Partnership' employ a Professional Mentor to oversee and quality assure the provision of training within the school. The programme enables trainees to have a clear understanding of learning theories and child development and how this impacts on student learning and informs their own development as a teacher. Trainees will have the opportunity to spend time in at least one of the other partnership schools to ensure a contrasting and comprehensive experience. As well as first class mentoring in school, trainees will participate in full-day conferences and shared professional studies sessions. These sessions can be tailored to the strengths and development needs of each individual. Feedback from trainees is extremely positive with all trainees securing Newly Qualified Teaching roles for the following academic year.",

Schools within 'The Partnership' are committed to making reasonable adjustments for disabled staff and to ensure that the needs of disabled staff are accommodated in the school environment, as far as is reasonably practical. Throughout the trainee’s time at school the Teacher Mentor will provide professional support and guidance and will have weekly scheduled meetings with the trainee. This process will be overseen by the Professional Mentor. In addition to the more formal aspects of the training, however, it is hoped that the trainee will regard both the Teacher Mentor and the Professional Mentor as confidantes and that they will be able to turn to both should difficulties arise. Please contact the Lead Schools for further advice and guidance on an individual basis.",

This time in school is supplemented with a comprehensive training programme, again delivered by successful serving practitioners, and masters-level input from our partner university. At the end of the programme, trainees leave with both QTS and a PGCE.\nCDAT is a successful, growing multi-academy trust stretching across the Diocese of Chester - including schools in Cheshire East and West, the Wirral, Stockport and Tameside. Our schools provide varied training opportunities – from larger schools with 350+ pupils to smaller ones with fewer than 50, and from diverse, urban areas to village and rural locations. It is this great variety that gives CDAT’s School Direct programme a special flavour. While all of the schools in the trust itself are Church of England schools – another distinctive feature of our programme – CDAT works more broadly with other faith and community schools and a range of specialist providers.\nWe promise to provide:\nPlacements in schools that offer strong mentoring and support.\nHigh quality training delivered by expert current classroom practitioners.\nQuality Masters-level input from our university partner.\nTop quality support from experienced tutors and the programme team.",

Together they run a small but successful School Direct Salaried teacher training programme within its longstanding partnership of schools across Somerset. Trainees on salaried programme will have some prior experience of teaching and will be employed by a partnership school to fulfil a part time teaching post. The salary grant from the DfE pays for the trainees' course fees and also contributes to the trainees' salaries.\nThis is a tough training route and is only for those who are able to demonstrate their understanding of teaching in the state sector and the demands of the classroom.\nSalaried trainees will be timetabled up to 13 hours of teaching each week. This will start from the first week of the course and continue through out the training year. A mentor in school is at hand to offer advice and support to each trainee.\nTrainees are able to gain QTS and PGCE via this route. Assessment for QTS is through weekly lesson observation and portfolio tasks which are specifically designed to allow trainees to showcase their practice. Our PGCE is delivered through the MSC's Professional Training (accredited by Bath Spa University). Assessment is in the form of three written assignments at Masters' level. Salaried trainees wishing to take the PGCE will need to pay the accreditation fee as the DfE grant only covers the cost of QTS training.",

Each trainee has a Personal Tutor (either the Director or Deputy Director) to provide pastoral and professional support throughout the course. This approach enables us to cater for individual needs with speed and flexibility, and is a key strength of the course. “The pastoral and professional support of DPSCITT staff is amazing, and a stand out feature of the course.” (Alannah, former trainee)\nRegular 1:1 meetings are timetabled with Personal Tutors to discuss each trainee’s needs and wellbeing, and trainees are encouraged to seek further support when necessary. Each week, School-based Tutors provide quality time to support each trainee, planning and coordinating their individual training programme. “Learning Conversations … are at the heart of this outstanding training programme. Skilled DPSCITT and school-based staff ensure each conversation is personal to that trainee and focused on their specific learning successes and areas for development.” (Ofsted, 2016)",

We have a number of secondary schools and over thirty five primary schools in the association, these are all quality assured by us and are located in and around Nottinghamshire, South Yorkshire and Lincolnshire.\nWe pride ourselves on a personal, tailored approach. We are a small, committed team who get to know you as individuals to support your journey into teaching. The choice of training school is led by you - you select the school for your training year, are interviewed in that school and hold relationships with your future team before your training even starts. We have well established relationships with all of the schools we work with and we collaborate with the understanding that the right choice of school is an essential and important part of the process. We are proud that some of our original cohort are now mentors for our current trainees. The employment rate for our trainees is high, with over half of each cohort being recruited directly into our partner schools. Please visit our website for more information - https://www.diverseassociation.org.uk/get-into-teaching/pathways-into-teaching/",

We pride ourselves on the personal approach. We know there is no such thing as a “typical trainee” so we don’t provide a one-size-fits-all course. We will help you to grow and become a great teacher. Our secondary Subject Specialist programme (SSP) was recognised by Ofsted as outstanding and highly innovative practice.\nSecondary trainees will have the opportunity to gain experience in 11-16/11-18 comprehensive schools/academies; special schools (EBD); a school with BESD status; Sixth Form colleges and primary schools. Trainees undertake substantial placements in at least 2 Partnership Schools. On each main placement you will be allocated a Subject Tutor and a School Tutor who will support and guide you through the school based training. We have 2 primary hubs; 1 based in St Michael's, Bishop Middleham and 1 based in Benedict Biscop Academy, Sunderland. Primary trainees will be allocated a 'home school' but will also do a second placement in one of the other primary partnership schools. On each placement you will be allocated a Mentor who will support and guide you through the school based training. All trainees have access to our purpose built learning centre in Newton Aycliffe. High quality trainees, impressive employment rates and effective partnerships with schools, mean we are in the position to offer outstanding teacher training.",

(Rode Heath Primary is named as the lead school for application process)\nThis programme has been designed to ensure that our trainees have the skill set that schools are looking for in the future generation of teachers. A measure of the success of the programme can be seen by the employability of our trainees and the final grading of their learning and teaching. Last year all trainees completing the award had secured full time employment before their graduation and 68% of our trainees were judged to be outstanding by their school based mentors.\nThe programme is strongly rooted in a School and University partnership so Associate Teachers spend 3 days in their placement school and two days at University. This enables a constant reflection on practice and the opportunity to move their thinking across all areas. The core programme begins with a 2 week subject knowledge enhancement in Literacy and Mathematics. This is to promote the Associate Teacher's understanding of progression across the key concepts in these two core curriculum areas. From there the Associate Teacher moves into a carefully balanced theoretical and practical application of their understanding.

We want to provide this opportunity for trainees because we believe in the importance of collaboration with an emphasis on good primary practice. This is our 9th year running this programme, which receives consistently great feedback. Students are placed within a partner school, choosing their specialist key stages. Students also meet in partner schools on Thursdays while on placement to observe lessons, creating a peer group which students find incredibly valuable in addition to study and school placements.\nThis year's programme includes workshops on setting up inspiring classrooms, using literature to enthuse, curriculum as behaviour management, and essentials of effective maths practice.\nOur students benefit from excellent support from Caroline Heal (consultant and former IoE tutor of 30 years ), a lead partnership mentor, Rosie Thomson (Eleanor Palmer School Deputy), school mentors, class teacher mentors and the student peer group. As the year progresses, our students guide our programme and we base sessions on specific needs and requests. We survey participants after every session for feedback on session impact.\nOur partner Camden primary schools are: Holy Trinity & St. Silas, Kentish Town, Thomas Coram, Torriano, Primrose Hill, Christopher Hatton, Fleet, Netley, Brecknock, Brookfield, Gospel Oak, Brookfield and Rhyl.",

      "trainWithUs": "We are a large SCITT, working with schools of all kinds (primary, secondary, special, independent) in the London area and across southern England. We have rolling recruitment, meaning that trainees can start in September or later in the academic year. Our course suits those who are independent, self-motivated learners. An individual training plan guides each trainee; we have an extensive on-line library, and training days in central London complement the in-school training. Trainees are assessed every five weeks, which ensures that they know what they have done well, and what to focus on next. Each trainee has a visiting tutor who is a secondary subject, or primary, specialist. Tutors visit their trainees for a full day each half term. These visits include two lesson observations of the trainee, feedback on strengths and development points, and a check on progress overall.\nOur aim is that all our trainees become excellent teachers. Everything we do is focused on this. In each of the last three years, two-thirds of our trainees have been graded 'excellent' in the final assessment for QTS. Over 90% have been appointed to a teaching post in the school in which they trained or did a placement (a few take teaching posts in other schools).",
      "trainWithDisability": "Our course is designed to be flexible and responsive to individual needs. As a group of full-time trainees starts each term, trainees who aren't able to train on a full-time basis, or who become ill and need time off during the course, don't miss out on any training as they join in with the next group of trainees. Adapted tasks are available for students whose dyslexia makes it hard to write full essays for their assignments. Training day venues have wheelchair access, and cater for all dietary requirements. We ask trainees to let us know of any disability or other need, so that we and the partner schools can make appropriate arrangements.\nTrainees who wish to gain a PGCE as well as QTS can add the academic award through our higher education partner. As we do not have a compulsory integral PGCE we have great flexibility in meeting our trainees' individual training needs eg we can adapt coursework tasks for those who need individual arrangements, we don't have fixed coursework deadlines during the training, and our trainees can start the course when it suits them and their school during the academic year.",

We deliver high quality, school-based programmes, devised in collaboration with our headteachers. One of our great strengths is our ability to personalise training with a strong emphasis on work-life balance and 1:1 support. We offer a rich experience, having a contrasting mixture of schools for placements, consisting of secondaries, around 70 primaries, a hospital school, special schools and an FE College. The primaries offer great diversity, from schools of less than 100 pupils to more than 600, from urban sites to small villages. We demonstrate high employment rates and are recognised as providing well-trained, sought after ECTs. We pride ourselves on training top quality teachers who:\n* put pupil progress at the heart of everything they do\n* continuously develop themselves using the principles of deliberate practice\n* root their classroom practice in up-to-date and relevant research.\nThe major benefit of this route is that Trainees have the opportunity, right from the start, to join an effective school and build practical experience. Trainees come together for the taught elements of the course each week, which is delivered by highly skilled current teachers who work in our excellent schools. A strong and supportive peer group develops, and life-long friendships are forged. The Primary (3-7 and 5-11) programmes are offered in partnership with SWTT and Bath Spa University, an Ofsted rated Outstanding provider for ITT, who deliver the PGCE aspect of the course on site, here in Exeter.",

We provide confidential information, guidance and support to students who have additional educational needs or disability, or a medical condition. Support for trainees was recognised as a strength of our partnership in our recent Ofsted inspection: 'The personalised support that trainees receive means that trainees’ needs are met exceptionally well.' All successful applicants to the programme will be taken through an occupational health check, so that we can create an access plan to best support them. We will work with all applicants to make adaptations to support their access to the programme. For example, this can include using online resources, coloured paper and slides for students with dyslexia, offering additional planning support and considering the best placement schools to support students with accessibility issues and other disabilities. We offer additional coaching support for some trainees, nurture sessions to support in identified areas and will support schools in different ways in order to ensure that trainees have the best opportunities for success. We have built wellbeing training into our programme as we believe this is important for all our trainees. We have several layers of tutor support to ensure trainees have a comprehensive support package. Trainees also have access to a confidential counselling service which also offers 24hr mental health support, legal, financial and other kinds of advice to assist trainees, whatever their needs. Our trainees and ECTs consistently rate our pastoral support as excellent.",

The Forest is a rural area between the Rivers Severn and Wye, where 31% of the population live in four market towns, the remainder in small widely scattered settlements. However, this idyll masks the fact that some areas are in the 10% most deprived wards nationally for \"Education, Skills & Training\" and \"Income Deprivation Affecting Children\" and there is a real need to raise aspirations of Forest children at an early age to make an impact in their adult life.\nTo make this happen, Forest of Dean Schools Direct works in partnership with West Gloucestershire Schools Partnership and the University of Gloucestershire, to design and deliver our Schools Direct Programme. The emphasis on ‘partnership’ is fundamental in our intention to produce highly skilled confident teachers who can make a difference to the lives of children in our schools. This approach has led to 100% of our previous students rating our programme as Very Good /Good and 92% of our graduates employed in Gloucestershire schools.\nA quote from one recent student says it all: “I have loved this course and will be recommending it to so many people. Thank you for helping me grow and believing in me, even when I doubted myself. I have grown in confidence and self-belief and am now ready to teach!”\nSo - why go anywhere else?",

In addition, we can accommodate staff and students with physical disabilities in most of our schools.\nAs part of the Schools Direct Programme, our students receive support with well-being which puts the role of teaching into context and provides strategies to help them look after themselves and have a good work-life balance.",

At Future Teacher Training we have an unrelenting focus on producing trainee teachers of the highest calibre, characterised by their deep subject knowledge, and desire to become expert teachers and leaders.\nOur Initial Teacher Training curriculum is unique and is designed intentionally and sequenced iteratively, building upon what we know about cognitive science and the road to becoming an expert teacher. We deliver weekly training sessions where we aim to disseminate a research-informed aspect of training that links to our curriculum strands. Our training is rooted in exploitation of examples and non-examples to exemplify how to apply this to your teaching practice. We endeavour to bust lingering educational myths and ensure trainees have access to exemplar curriculum resources. These sessions are combined with practice-based, often subject-specific training to empower trainees to apply the pedagogical principles to their own subject and classroom, with the oversight of subject experts who can model best practice and give feedback, whilst working collaboratively with your subject/phase peers.",

We tailor the year to maximise your skills and ensure you have the best possible start to your teaching career.\nSecondly, because our trainees don’t have to attend University lectures, we have time to give them a broad and carefully sequenced curriculum in total synergy with their school placements. Our trainees teach in a wide range of settings and sequentially learn the skills and knowledge to teach pupils from all backgrounds and of all abilities. Finally, our programmes are competitively priced because we know graduates are already carrying huge university debts. All of our trainees complete trauma training. We also give our secondary trainees a free qualification alongside so they all leave as qualified teachers of PSHE Association [Personal, Social, Health and Economic Education].

An important part of putting this into practice is a commitment to prohibit discrimination on the grounds of disability in all training matters, to increase employment opportunities for people who have a disability and to ensure that its recruitment and selection processes are fully accessible.\nAt the point of application, we ask candidates if they need any adjustments for the assessment day or any extra time to complete the activities. We make it clear that any information will always be kept strictly confidential unless they agree to it being shared with schools or mentors.\nWe meet individually with trainees regularly about their needs. Trainees have different learning needs and are members of diverse communities: a trainee with dyslexia may also be a single parent and a trainee with depression may also be struggling with finance. Talking to trainees about their individual needs early, and ensuring all reasonable adjustments are in place before they begin their placements in schools, is crucial. In our Ofsted inspection report 2017, it states:\nBoth pastoral support and wrap-around, bespoke care across the partnership are outstanding. Every trainee teacher has access to the partnership’s life coach. He delivers regular sessions to individuals and to the cohort on developing resilience, maintaining a work–life balance and ensuring emotional well-being.

This training programme has been designed and reconfigured every year to suit the needs of the trainees and to compliment and support the central training provided by The University of Reading.

Trainees develop a strong understanding of the needs of individual pupils.\n5.\tWellbeing and support\nWe hope trainees build a career in our partnership schools and feel fully supported in doing so, developing effective strategies and habits to manage their workload and enjoy their teaching.\nGITEP SCITT works with the University of Bristol to offer the academic PGCE.

We have had trainees with hearing and visual impairments and have worked with placement schools to ensure suitable support.\nTrainees receive excellent support from mentors and training managers in schools, as well as their subject leader. Liaison between schools and the GITEP leadership is very strong and we are used to making reasonable adjustments to help trainees, both short term and over the whole course.\nAll GITEP PGCE trainees are registered as students with the University of Bristol and this gives access to the full range of student services offered by the University.

During our recent Ofsted Inspection, one of the findings was that: ‘Leaders pay close and extensive attention to the welfare of trainees. They respond rapidly and effectually to those needing support’ (Ofsted 2018). After recruitment, we ask trainees to complete a ‘Fitness to Teach’ questionnaire which asks if any adjustments are required, we also require trainees to be assessed by an occupational health specialist. If appropriate, a ‘Wellbeing Plan’ will be created which is bespoke to the trainee’s needs; this will be regularly reviewed. We will then work closely with the trainee to make adjustments where we possibly can (for example, PowerPoint presentations in advance or printed on coloured paper). Declaring any disabilities will not disadvantage trainees and their application; we make any appropriate adjustments and make sure that trainees are placed in a supportive training environment.\nWe regularly ensure that these adjustments are maintained and re-assessed, to ensure that needs are continually met. Disability access and provision are in accordance with legal requirements in all our settings. Some settings have further specialist provision and further details can be acquired by contacting the individual setting via their website contact details.",

Our Partnership includes a range of settings from semi-rural to inner city schools to provide our trainees with a diverse teaching experience. Our trainees cited that their host schools were supportive, always willing to help and \"were given all the tools they needed to ‘be a teacher’.\" Each trainee is provided with a highly experienced mentor, and also a personal visiting tutor to guide both trainee and mentor through the ITT process. The tutor will visit their trainee at least ONCE every HALF term to ensure they are thriving. The Partnership also provides weekly core training from facilitators who are ‘’inspirational’’ and that encourage our trainees to feel safe taking risks and to develop a fluent teaching style. We pride ourselves on our bespoke and ‘round the clock’ support for each individual trainee so they have the confidence and competence to flourish not only in their first year of teaching but in years to come. We consider that our trainees will be life changers and leaders of the future and we will support YOU beyond your training.",

      "trainWithDisability": "The University of Sussex Schools’ Partnership welcomes applications from any candidates who have the potential to make excellent teachers regardless of disability and additional needs. We have previously successfully supported trainee teachers with Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, Autism, Mental Health conditions and a range of physical, hearing and visual impairments.\nAll candidates complete an online health questionnaire administered by the University's Occupational Health Department in the summer before beginning the course. This is to establish mental and physical fitness for teaching. Following this, if you have a disability or health condition, you are then advised to register with the University Student Support service and an assessment is arranged to establish your needs and to identify additional support and adjustments needed to help you be as successful as possible on the course. At all stages we strongly recommend trainees fully disclose their individual needs so a support package can be tailored to each individual.",

We have an excellent reputation, both locally and nationally, and were ranked second overall in the UK for Education in the Guardian University Guide 2022. One of the key elements of our courses that students feel define their experience at Kingston is the excellent support they receive from tutors and school-based mentors on placement. We believe that this is a significant factor in the success students have in gaining their award of QTS and the PGCE, as well as finding employment. Our students become effective, creative, inclusive and evidence-informed teachers that are highly sought after by schools following graduation.\nOur courses are located on a spacious and beautiful site on Kingston Hill, set amongst natural woodlands adjacent to Richmond Park, yet within easy access of both Kingston upon Thames and Central London. This self-contained campus, with a range of facilities, is linked to other parts of the university by a free bus service and has free onsite parking for students.",

Our cohort (typically 12-14 trainees), is small enough to allow us to know each trainee’s individual strengths and developmental needs.\nOutcomes for trainees are exceptionally high: 97% of trainees have completed the course and achieved both their Post Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) and Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) since the course commenced in 2011. 98.5% of these have been graded as either outstanding or good.* *Figures do not include the 2019-20 cohort as these trainees were not graded at the end of their course due to Covid-19.\nKKS is part of the South Lakes Federation teaching school alliance.

After recruitment, we ask trainees to complete a ‘Fitness to Teach’ questionnaire which asks if any adjustments are required, we also require trainees to be assessed by an occupational health specialist. If appropriate, a ‘Wellbeing Plan’ will be created which is bespoke to the trainee’s needs; this will be regularly reviewed. We will then work closely with the trainee to make adjustments where we possibly can (for example, PowerPoint presentations in advance or printed on coloured paper). Declaring any disabilities will not disadvantage trainees and their application; we make any appropriate adjustments and make sure that trainees are placed in a supportive training environment.\nWe regularly ensure that these adjustments are maintained and re-assessed, to ensure that needs are continually met.

This means that our beginning teachers graduate with 120 Masters level credits. Many go on to complete a Masters in Education Practice during their early career.\nOur emphasis is on developing inclusive and reflective practitioners. We ensure that LJMU teachers develop a deep understanding of subjects, the curriculum, learners and learning. This enables them to provide the best and most appropriate learning opportunities for all children and young people, with a positive impact on their development and achievements. School-based experience takes place largely in a Home School, supported by expert teacher mentors. Shorter placements are also provided in contrasting school settings. This ensures that our students can confidently plan, teach and manage learning in varied settings and contexts.",
      "trainWithDisability": "LJMU is committed to Equality of Opportunity and proud of the help we offer. The Disability Advice Team will help you access the support you need. The best time to contact the Disability Advice Team is before you start your course. By contacting the team before you begin and discussing your disability, you'll be able to receive support from when you arrive. Email: disability@ljmu.ac.uk Tel: 0151 231 3164/3165.\nIf you need an Individual Student Learning Plan (ISLP) which sets out the type of support you may need and who is responsible for ensuring your support is in place, this will be put in place by an LJMU Disability Adviser once you have met to discuss your needs. Once finalised, your plan will be sent to you via email. As soon as you have agreed the ISLP it will be sent to your Disability Coordinator and then, with your agreement, passed on to the relevant academic and support staff.\nAll trainees are encouraged to disclose any specific learning need that they experience, in order to make any adjustments, both at LJMU and within our Partner Schools. As part of the enrolment process to Teacher Training Programmes all students are required to complete a Health Questionnaire and some may be asked to attend a screening appointment with our Occupational Health Unit. This is designed to ensure that arrangements are in place, from the outset, to support any students who may need additional support or reasonable adjustments to be made.",

We view your training year as the beginning of a fulfilling career, and as such, work with you to make your transition into teaching a positive, rewarding experience.\nAmongst the many strengths highlighted in EMTTP’s most recent Ofsted report were the excellent levels of pastoral care afforded to trainees, the shared, committed partnership ethos across all stakeholders, the quality of training and the responsiveness of course leaders to feedback received. All of these are crucial in supporting trainees to have a successful and enjoyable year of training. All of our trainees in 2017/18 reported that they felt that their training had prepared them fully for their first teaching position. Our trainees have a good record of securing employment within our partner schools. This potential for continuity, trainees tell us, provides a real incentive to train with us.",
      "trainWithDisability": "In line with the Equality act 2010, we ensure equal treatment of all applicants to our courses. We will give equal treatment in access to our courses regardless of the identified protected characteristics. Therefore, we welcome applications from all prospective teachers who are suitably qualified and demonstrate the potential and motivation to teach.\nIn order to support trainees with disabilities and other needs we ask all trainees to undergo an occupational health assessment. This will identify any additional support or adjustments that we can make to ensure that you have access to the best possible training. Our partner schools themselves will work with you to ensure that you have access to the experiences that you need to allow you to be successful in your training. We also have key staff within the partnership, such as SENCo’s and Inclusion Leaders who will work with training staff to ensure that we are putting in place the necessary support for all trainees. As a partnership we are committed to supporting all of our trainees to make their training year as enjoyable and successful as possible. The young people within our schools gain so many positives from being taught by teachers from a range of backgrounds. Through our training model, we have regular opportunities for all trainees to network. We know, from feedback, that this is seen, by trainees, as extremely valuable and supportive.",

With partner schools fully involved in all aspects of the programme design and delivery, a key strength is evidenced through the shared commitment and resolve held by all stakeholders’ to producing good and outstanding teachers capable of making a significant difference to the lives of the children in the local area. Acknowledged by Ofsted, Inspectors commented on how trainees were ‘well prepared and highly motivated to teach’ and how as ECTs they ‘approached their induction years with confidence and commitment.’\nThe Partnership’s strong commitment to supporting the development of a high performing local teacher workforce is clearly evidenced in the outcomes achieved by trainees. Approximately 20% of the current teacher workforce has been successfully ‘grown’ by the Partnership, many of whom have gone on rapidly into senior leadership positions. Over 90% of schools in North Lincolnshire have securing an Ofsted grading of good or better.\nRecruitment and retention rates are excellent: 92% of trainees secure ECT posts in their first year, with 69% recruited within the local area and 27% of these employed by partnership schools. The core programme benefits from this success as many ex-trainees become involved as mentors and training facilitators, enabling them to pass on the best possible advice and support based on their own experiences of school-centred training.",

For example, at the assessment phase of the recruitment process, applicants with dyslexia are offered longer to complete the written task, they are offered coloured sheets to help them access the texts, issues with spelling and grammar are taken into account. During training, materials are printed to make them accessible on coloured papers, using different fonts, different sizes, 1:1 help is provided with writing assignments and other tasks which they might struggle with. Applicants with physical disabilities are catered for according to their varying needs so access issues on to various sites would be reviewed and plans put into place to mitigate them, e.g. choice of school placements, ensuring central training took place in ground floor rooms, travel to different locations minimised.\nApplicants with hearing or sight needs, specialised equipment would be sourced to support them in school locations and in central training venues, e.g. use of microphones.\nAll trainees have access to Welfare and Counselling Services as part of the local authority responsibility so applicants with any mental health problems can be fully supported by expert practitioners.",

We view your training year as the beginning of a fulfilling career, and as such, work with you to make your transition into teaching a positive, rewarding experience.\nAmongst the many strengths highlighted in EMTTP’s most recent Ofsted report were the excellent levels of pastoral care afforded to trainees, the shared, committed partnership ethos across all stakeholders, the quality of training and the responsiveness of course leaders to feedback received. All of these are crucial in supporting trainees to have a successful and enjoyable year of training. All of our trainees in 2017/18 reported that they felt that their training had prepared them fully for their first teaching position.

A key part of our philosophy is that we ensure equality of opportunity and welcome, value and respect all who train with PLS.\nWe aim to build a learning community based on justice and a sense of personal responsibility. Central to our philosophy is promoting dialogue and cooperation with the wider community and encouraging a commitment to life-long learning.\nPLS is led by two East London schools, Sydney Russell in Dagenham and St Angela’s Ursuline in Newham both with long track records of outstanding teacher training. Now, as a SCITT, we're in the position to offer you top class training from outstanding professionals in a vibrant teaching atmosphere. The perfect start to your career.\nFrom the outset you will be part of the school staff. You will be seen by colleagues and students as a member of staff and not a ‘trainee’ who arrives later in the year. This seemingly small point makes a huge difference to your standing in school and provides a firmer platform from which you can develop your teaching skills. Our courses give you the very best of both worlds: theory, practice, professional development and placements with colleagues who really want to make you an outstanding teacher.",

You’ll spend over 24 weeks in your placement schools, meaning you’ll get to properly immerse yourself in school life with both pupils and colleagues.\nOur training network consists of primary, secondary and special schools spread across West and North Yorkshire, meaning there will always be a location and school type that fits with your own personal characteristics and circumstances.\nThe Red Kite approach is geared towards providing each of our trainees with the help and guidance they need at each stage of their journey into teaching, with a dedicated support structure in place from day one which includes experienced mentors and a dedicated Early Career Leader. Our courses are designed to give you the skills and experience most sought after by employers – evidenced by the number of trainees securing a teaching post.\nAll of our courses lead to Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and a PGCE (worth 60 masters credits) awarded by the prestigious School of Education at the University of Leeds.",
      "trainWithDisability": "At Red Kite we believe the teachers we train are important role models – both in their schools and in the wider community – and that they should reflect the diversity around them and help create a culture that promotes and celebrates inclusion in all its forms.\nIn response to this, we have built up a network of ‘Diversity Champions’, whose role it is to promote conscious inclusion and ensure that every one of our trainees, whatever their personal circumstances, feel welcomed, supported and valued.\nOver years we have worked with a number of individual trainees to tackle specific barriers they have faced, including:\n•\tWorking with a trainee with mobility issues to ensure their placement schools were able to arrange accessible parking, ground floor classrooms, bespoke pupil seating plans and a timetable that allowed them sufficient time to reach other areas of the school if required.\n•\tSupporting trainees with autism to clarify expectations with their schools and oversee any necessary modifications to classroom layouts, lighting and sounds.\n•\tMaking course adjustments for trainees with dyslexia, such as sending PowerPoint presentations in advance of the training and working with them to develop strategies to help turn any particular perceived weaknesses such as spelling and short-term memory into a strength.\n•\tEnsuring that all trainees learn about adult mental health awareness as part of their course.\nOur commitment to diversity in all its forms is evidenced by the fact that 15% of our trainees report having some form of disability.",

This is a view shared by current and ex-trainees, employers and partnership schools. We pride ourselves in developing strong relationships with individual trainees and schools. This means we are able to provide personalised training that meets the individual needs of each of our trainees. Each trainee is assigned a Professional Tutor who monitors their progress and well-being throughout the programme and is available to answer any queries through the year. The SCITTELS programme prepares trainees for teaching in diverse, urban environments. While the training programme covers all aspects of a teacher's role, inclusion and behaviour management are particular strengths. The skills you learn on the SCITTELS PGCE will prepare you for teaching whether you choose to stay in East London or move elsewhere. The SCITTELS PGCE is a one year, full-time course. Trainees can choose whether to specialise in Early Years and Key Stage one (ages 3-7) or Key Stages one and two (ages 5-11). It is assessed against 'M' level criteria leading to Qualified Teacher Status and 60 credits at Master's Level. Our PGCE is validated by the Goldsmiths University. We provide a range of employment support to ensure trainees are best-placed to gain their first teaching job. Many PGCE trainees are offered employment at one of their placement schools and almost all secure full-time employment after completing the programme.",

We offer support and professional guidance in making a transition from support roles in school into teacher training and employment.\nWe promote 'Excellence for All' by recruiting and training high calibre teachers for local schools. Our trainees have gone on to successful employment, mostly within our Partnership. The majority of our School Direct trainees have been formally assessed as 'Outstanding' by the time they complete their training.\nDunraven is part of the South Lambeth Schools' Partnership working with ten local primary schools and SL6, a post-16 collaboration with local secondary schools, which provides a wide range of training and development opportunities for our trainees. A significant building programme means the school now has purpose-built facilities.\nOur School Direct training partnership is a strong local network of Lambeth primary and secondary schools. It includes Corpus Christi Roman Catholic Primary School, Crown Lane, Dunraven, Sunnyhill, Goldfinch, Julian's, St Andrew's Catholic, Rosendale and Van Gogh Primary Schools.

      "trainWithDisability": "All our training programmes are bespoke and tailored to meet individual needs, reflecting applicants' skills and experience and any health or disability requirements. Where possible we collaborate with our training providers to adapt training provision to support trainees with disabilities and other needs. Feedback from previous trainees suggests high levels of satisfaction with the support we offer them, carefully co-ordinated between school and training provider. We recognise that teaching is a rewarding but demanding career and that there are times when even the best trainees will face challenges. We promote trainee well-being and resilience to enable them to make a long-term commitment to the teaching profession and this is at the heart of our training provision. The University of Roehampton offers an extensive range of student support and well-being services. There is a strong tutorial support system in the School of Education and during school placements. Trainees can apply for a Statement of Adjustment to ensure their needs are met.

Our vision is to nurture and develop resilient and passionate individuals who are skilled in critical thinking. We believe this will create effective teachers who are ready to continue their pursuit of excellence. All trainees on the Oak Partnership School Direct and SCITT Programmes have the opportunity to work towards a PGCE, in partnership with Somerset SCITT, judged Outstanding by OFSTED in 2017, and accredited by the University of Worcester. Trainees will learn on the job in a supportive environment with a mentor throughout their placements. Experience in school progresses from observing and working alongside the class-teacher, to taking full responsibility, initially for individuals and groups, and later, for a whole class. Throughout this experience, trainees will acquire the skills, knowledge and understanding of the range of elements which make an outstanding teacher, as specified in the Teachers’ Standards; from developing good relationships with children that promote learning, with other colleagues to working within a framework and national/school policies to deliver the Curriculum.

We work alongside a cluster of local primary schools to deliver our teacher training programme.

Training sessions provide practical strategies and techniques that will support you when you are teaching in school. There are also many opportunities for you to learn from and teach your fellow trainees through sessions that allow you to share your successes, ideas and challenges with each other and reflect on your school experiences. You will benefit from a mentor dedicated to supporting your development as well as a professional tutor who will oversee your development throughout the year.\nWe have a reputation for excellence, which is why more trainees than ever are choosing Stockton SCITT.

For example, in previous years, we have offered maternity and paternity leave, compassionate leave and temporary flexible training hours to manage a specific issue.\nThe well-being of all our trainees is very important to us. We continually monitor well-being through a number of mechanisms and individual support is put in place as required.

Our alliance is based in the North East and North Yorkshire and we work together to make the most of our collective experience for the benefit of our children. We create opportunities for postgraduates to train as primary teachers within our schools as either salaried or fee-paying trainees depending on the availability of places. Our programmes are specifically designed for postgraduates who would like to develop expertise in teaching children with special educational needs. Our vision is 'to equip all teachers working with special needs pupils with high quality expertise and to ensure that all children receive the education they deserve'.\nRoughly one in six children have recognised special educational needs. These include emotional and social difficulties, multi-sensory impairment and physical disabilities. Working with an extensive range of professionals, and through programmes of research and development, we have devised a range of workshops which demonstrate how strategies and therapies which will be unfamiliar to many mainstream schools are used to support the learning of children with special needs. The skills you will develop with us will consequently be valuable in a wide variety of educational contexts. Previous students completing our training have left us with the knowledge and expertise to confidently enter the profession – all have qualified and immediately secured teaching positions.",

Our school has developed systems and procedures for supporting disabled students and making sure they progress in their studies. As a provider working closely with Northumbria University we are able to signpost students requiring support for dyslexia/mental health issues and those requiring physical adjustments. We also have access to a mini-bus with a lift for those requiring transportation.\nIt would be important in the first instance to understand the additional support a prospective student may require, and as part of that process we would work closely with each student to gain information about any disability, health condition, or learning support needs they may have. This would include undertaking a joint risk assessment. By having as much detailed information as possible the right kind of support can be put in place.\nIt would be unlawful for Sunningdale to refuse an applicant a place on their teacher training programme or treat them less favourably because of a disability (Disability Discrimination Act since 2001, Equality Act 2010). We welcome all applicants whatever their ‘need’.",

There is a strong emphasis on understanding special educational needs and positive behaviour management. The programme is designed and led by outstanding school practitioners, giving trainee teachers practical training and advice based on classroom experience\nIn addition, our trainees are students of the University of Exeter who award Qualified Teacher Status and the Post Graduate Certificate of Education to trainees on successful completion of the training year.

Teach North East will allow you to become immersed in school life from the start, but offers you a safety net of the support needed to thrive as a new teacher.\nTeach North East is a partnership of 16 Secondary and Primary schools working in close collaboration with local providers to deliver high quality and innovative teacher training. The Lead School for the Partnership is Harton Academy, an OFSTED ‘Outstanding’ rated school (2013) and has been a successful Teaching School. Harton was one of the first 100 teaching schools in the country. A distinctive feature of the programme is the focus on carefully staged and appropriately supervised practical classroom experience within two contrasting schools, which is further supported by academic and professional study via central training.",

Harton Academy hosts a large number of pupils and students with a range of physical impairments and social, emotional and mental health conditions, and can use this expertise to help identify and provide any support agreed for trainees.

Both of our accredited providers have a Disability Support Team who will be able to provide advice, information and guidance to students with a disability; students with mental illness or mental health difficulties; students with Specific Learning Difficulty (SpLD) such as dyslexia. In relation to our partner schools where a school is unsuitable for a particular placement, we would seek to find an appropriate school which can accommodate successfully.

New members of staff comment frequently on how well they feel supported. The Academy enables trainee teachers and NQTs to make good progress during their first year of teaching with many becoming outstanding classroom practitioners.

We view your training year as the beginning of a fulfilling career, and as such, work with you to make your transition into teaching a positive, rewarding experience.\nAmongst the many strengths highlighted in EMTTP’s most recent Ofsted report were the excellent levels of pastoral care afforded to trainees, the shared, committed partnership ethos across all stakeholders, the quality of training and the responsiveness of course leaders to feedback received. All of these are crucial in supporting trainees to have a successful and enjoyable year of training. All of our trainees in 2017/18 reported that they felt that their training had prepared them fully for their first teaching position. Our trainees have a good record of securing employment within our partner schools. This potential for continuity, trainees tell us, provides a real incentive to train with us.",

Our partner schools themselves will work with you to ensure that you have access to the experiences that you need to allow you to be successful in your training.

As a partnership we are committed to supporting all of our trainees to make their training year as enjoyable and successful as possible. The young people within our schools gain so many positives from being taught by teachers from a range of backgrounds.

We view your training year as the beginning of a fulfilling career, and as such, work with you to make your transition into teaching a positive, rewarding experience.\nAmongst the many strengths highlighted in EMTTP’s most recent Ofsted report were the excellent levels of pastoral care afforded to trainees, the shared, committed partnership ethos across all stakeholders, the quality of training and the responsiveness of course leaders to feedback received. All of these are crucial in supporting trainees to have a successful and enjoyable year of training. All of our trainees in 2017/18 reported that they felt that their training had prepared them fully for their first teaching position.

The Sheffield SCITT aims to supply most of the Newly Qualified Teacher needs of our partnership of schools. Whilst we cannot guarantee jobs for all trainees at the end of the course, the vast majority of trainees secure jobs within our partnership. We remain small enough to know every trainee as an individual and give every partner school a voice in the running of the SCITT, but large enough to offer our trainees a diverse and bespoke experience of a different schools within the partnership - including Academies, Maintained Community Schools, Church Schools, those in multicultural inner cities, secondary schools with large sixth forms and primary schools with early years centres.\nOur Lead School is one of a small number of schools designated as part of the Research School network. This means that your training is informed throughout by the evidence base as to what makes the effective teaching.\nOur course includes the opportunity to study for a PGCE in Secondary Education (PGCSE) during your ITT year.

We encourage all our applicants to declare their disability on their application form and to discuss their requirements with us at interview. While disabled access to our schools is good we can only place trainees at the most suitable school to meet their needs if we know what those needs are.\nIn addition to one to one support from your mentors and subject leaders we currently provide all our trainees access to free access to the Westfield Healthy Extras which provides support throughout the year.

Our training room is accessible to people with a physical disability and there is a lift in the training centre to avoid the use of stairs, if necessary. Some of our schools are more accessible than others to those with a disability and this would be considered, as necessary, when deciding which schools to place you in. We use electronic portfolios of documents and this has supported applicants in the past with dyslexia. Dyslexic applicants still have to meet the course entry requirements, including assessment of your fundamental English and Maths skills, and you should check what special arrangements we can make, if this applies to you. We pride ourselves on our pastoral care and bespoke attitude to teacher training. You are an individual and we aspire to train you to take your individuality into the classroom. This, combined with the knowledge, skills and understanding you will gain during your study with us, creates a happy teacher which is what we all want to be! We believe that happy teachers are teachers for years to come and retention of our alumni in the teaching profession is high after 5 years. We devote curriculum and tutorial time to encouraging you to look after your wellbeing as a teacher and the experienced and expert team are there to support you.",

More than 300 students study on our higher education courses in Early Years/ Childhood Studies and 95% of our newly-qualified teachers are employed in a teaching role within six months.\nWe enjoy an excellent reputation for supporting students thanks to a team of highly experienced full-time lecturers who draw on their practical knowledge of working in the early years sector. Staff are a key resource to help your successful progression through the course.\nAdditionally we have worked closely for many years with local schools and other providers to train those who work within the primary sector. Key senior staff from these establishments have helped us put together the year's training. This important factor ensures the courses have been written to meet the needs of schools and will improve employability within this sector.\nBesides achieving Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) graduates will also work for a Post Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) which is accredited by the University of Birmingham. The work for your PGCE is integrated within the QTS programme.\nThe course particularly focuses on three separate themes:\n- Managing Behaviour\n- Working with children with special educational needs and/or disabilities (SEND)\n- Working with children who use English as an additional language (EAL)",
      "trainWithDisability": "We urge students to tell us about their disabilities or other needs so that we can put a support package in place. That help begins even before the course starts as we provide orientation support aimed at helping students get used to the UCB environment and finding their way around during induction sessions and taster days. We also provide mobility training for blind or partially-sighted people.\nThe help continues once the studies begin whether in the form of lecture notes and handouts provided in an alternative format, support workers or the loan of digital recorders to record lectures. We can also help manage the workload of studying with one-to-one mentor support sessions for students with autistic spectrum conditions, providing specialist equipment and software to enable independent learning and arranging alternative methods of assessment.\nWhen it comes to exams we can arrange for a number of solutions to help students from having extra time or rest/nutrition breaks to providing exam papers in alternative formats.\nUCB is committed to try and provide access for everyone to our facilities and our website now has a clear description of our premises which was carried out by an independent agency, DisabledGo.\nAlso. our Mental Health and Wellbeing Service is committed to helping students access the most appropriate support and information.",

It allows those who have just finished a degree, or have been working in a career for many years to combine teacher training at Goldsmith's with 'learning on the job'. Successful completion leads to a PGCE with Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).\n\nVita is Latin for ‘life’ and all the schools in our Schools Direct group are committed to lifelong learning, for our pupils, staff and any trainees who work with us. We look forward to supporting our School Direct trainees in their journey to becoming outstanding teachers. \n\nVita London is proud to provide individualised support and training. Our vision is for each School Direct candidate to feel part of the team from day one. It can be scary to start something new and we understand that providing personal support is the best way to mentor. Unlike some larger SD chains, we feel that high quality training starts with getting the attention and direction in a more intimate setting. This allows our candidates to feel part of their training and the school community from the start. We aspire to have our candidates join our schools or link schools after their successful training.",

We are a large Alliance of local schools firmly committed to the philosophy of improving outcomes for the children in our schools. We understand that the best way to achieve this is through quality teaching and it is this belief that led us to establish our highly successful ITT programme which has run now since 2014. All placements are organised by YSTA staff and take place in schools within the Alliance. Trainees can expect to spend 80% of their time in class gaining practical experience on how to provide challenging and meaningful teaching and learning opportunities. To complement this, there is regular theory based training delivered by Lancashire's Senior Consultants and other experienced practitioners. Our training programme ensures that trainees gain the skills and experience needed to become fully qualified and highly effective teachers able to take up a post in either Key Stage 1 or Key Stage 2.",
