The programme has been designed to ensure that you are expertly trained as a Primary teacher to take up your post as an outstanding NQT and is enhanced by attending training at the CLF SCITT. \r\n\r\nRight from day one, trainees are treated as a member of staff and take part in all aspects of school life including attending all staff meetings and other CPD opportunities. Trainees attend one days joint training a week and then put their learning into practice straight away back in school so it really is learning on the job. Trainees work with their school-based mentor, who is responsible for supporting and guiding their professional development, ensuring that they have the opportunities that they need both within the school and drawing on expertise from other schools. \r\n\r\nThe staff in our schools are our most valuable resource and have a proven track record for delivering high quality training and professional development. They have high expectations and are eager to share their skills, knowledge and practice with the next generation of teachers - they are in the best position to prepare trainee teachers for excellence in their own practice. They endeavour to support trainees in many different ways through coaching and mentoring, observations and feedback to ensure that they have the best possible preparation and training.\r\n\r\nTraining in school progresses from observing and working alongside an experienced teacher to taking full responsibility, firstly for groups, and later for the whole class as the academic year progresses. Progress is assessed through regular formal and informal monitoring of teaching competencies leading to profile reviews and assignments which link education/subject theory with the teaching and learning in the classroom. \r\n\r\nThe University aspect of the course brings together theory and practice and is carefully timetabled to ensure the work load dis not too high.\r\nTrainees have access to their extensive library, resources and tutor for support. \r\n\r\nWhen you qualify, you will achieve a PGCE with QTS.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Our aim is to invite applicants to interview who have the talent, commitment and enthusiasm to become outstanding Primary teachers. \r\n\r\nEarly application is recommended.

This will include working with a small group of children. During the interview, we will have an informed discussion with candidates on teaching and learning, subject knowledge, the curriculum and previous school and/or setting experience.
