Such scholarships are awarded in place of a bursary.","aboutCourse":"Our course ensures that you receive as much training as possible in our partner schools. \r\nYou will be allocated a HOME school placement from the first day of the school year, from September until February half term, and an AWAY school placement from February half term until July. A Key Stage 5 placement of at least two weeks will also be provided during the year.\r\nYou will attend subject pedagogy at Liverpool Hope University one day per week in your Home placement. Also, each week, one afternoon will be spent receiving Professional Development training with the rest of the WWLCSD cohort, at one of the ten partner schools. 15 Masters level days at Liverpool Hope will take place across the year, and you will also complete two modules of the Catholic Certificate in Religious Studies (CCRS) as part of your training. Training for the CCRS will be delivered at some of the school-run Professional Development sessions.\r\nYou will be assessed through the completion of two assignments at Masters level by Liverpool Hope University. This will ensure that you are awarded a PGCE, plus you will submit evidence of meeting the Teacher Standards to your placement schools at four review points through the year. To complete the double module of the CCRS, you will be required to submit two 1500 word assignments.\r\n","interviewProcess":"The interview process will involve you spending one day at St Mary's Catholic High School in Astley, which is where our administrative team is based.\r\nYou will be asked to deliver a twenty minute task to a group of five Key Stage Three pupils, on a topic which you will have been given to prepare in advance of the day. We will be observing how well you can engage with the pupils, and whether you are able to prepare an appropriate task, and resource it effectively, to ensure that they make some progress. We are not looking for an already competent teacher, we are looking for people who we believe have the necessary qualities to be \"trained\" to that level.\r\nAfter the teaching task, you will be asked to complete a twenty minute written task, where you will reflect upon the strengths and areas in need of development in your group teaching task, This is intended to assess your ability to evaluate a lesson effectively, and indicates the standard of your written English. \r\nAfter lunch, you will have a formal interview where the panel will be made up of the Director (and/or the Assistant Director) of the course, a Head Teacher and a Professional Mentor from one of our partnership schools.\r\nA representative from Liverpool Hope University will also attend some of the Interview Days as a Quality Assurance measure.\r\nWe will inform you of the outcome of the interview and offer feedback within the next five working days. ","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We are confident that, through our personalised, structured interview process, we get to know our applicants quickly, and strive to place them in the schools and departments within our programme where they would be able to flourish during their training year. Travelling distances from home are taken into consideration, wherever possible. \r\nWe do not usually place trainees in a school if they used to attend it as a pupil, since we feel it is important for the training year to provide as broad an experience as possible. Trainees can express a preference for a placement at a specific school in the partnership, although we cannot guarantee to meet their request.\r\nAll schools in the partnership have comprehensive intakes and you will gain experience of working with young people of all abilities across the age range from 11-18. \r\nYou will be assigned a Professional Mentor and a Subject Mentor in each of your two placement schools. Our mentors are outstanding teachers themselves, and they are all required to undertake a rigorous training programme to develop their mentoring skills. This includes coaching, effective classroom observation and feedback skills.","personalQualities":"We are looking for ambitious trainee teachers who are passionate and enthusiastic about making a difference to the lives of the young people that we serve. We want you to have a desire to share your passion with students of all abilities across the secondary age range.\r\nTrainees on our programme do not need to be Catholics themselves, but would be individuals who recognise the intangible extras which working as part of a faith-based community can bring to the lives of both staff and young people.\r\n","otherRequirements":"We do not require you to have done a set amount of classroom observations prior to the application process. However, meaningful experience of working with young people of secondary age in ways such as helping with a sports team, drama or youth group, or simply having spent some time in a secondary school, would demonstrate, at interview, a commitment to the application.\r\nAll trainees accepted onto the course require DBS clearance before commencing their training.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:51:03.947Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-16T08:22:37.039Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2024"}
