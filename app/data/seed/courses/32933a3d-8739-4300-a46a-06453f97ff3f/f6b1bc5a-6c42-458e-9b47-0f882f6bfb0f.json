This route enables you to draw on the expertise of your placement schools, the Alliance Training Manager, Specialist Leaders of Education (SLE) and the HEI (the University of the West of England) over a year of training.  Some sessions take place at Bishop Road Primary School in a small group setting, where you can benefit from bespoke input in a group of around 20. This is not a salaried route and so normal tuition fees apply.\r\n\r\nThis programme has an academic element, with a small number of assignments across the year, working at Masters' level. You will have a school-based mentor, university tutor and training with the Alliance Training Manager and outstanding class teachers from across the city.\r\n\r\nAssessment is ongoing while training at a school. This will include a weekly observation with feedback and also a weekly meeting with your mentor to discuss progress. \r\n\r\nDuring the year trainees will spend time in two schools (typically September to January & March to June). The first block placement will be in either Key Stage 1 or Key Stage 2, and the second block placement will be in the alternative Key Stage and a contrasting setting.\r\n\r\nOur PGCE programme offers a real range of experiences across the year to prepare you for your first teaching post. Join us and continue our impressive completion and employment rates on this route!\r\n\r\nApply via this link - https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-teacher-training ","interviewProcess":"If you are successful at the application stage and are subsequently invited to interview, the structure of the day consists of the following:\r\n\r\n- A welcome and introduction to the day\r\n- A 10 minute activity working with children (details of this will accompany an invitation to interview email)\r\n- A 5 minute micro-teach to other candidates  (details of this will accompany an invitation to interview email)\r\n- An interview which will last no longer than 30 minutes\r\n- A Maths & English task\r\n\r\nThe interview panel for the day usually consists of members of the Bristol Primary Training and Support Alliance and Partnership head teachers.\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We have strong relationships with a wide range of primary schools across Bristol, serving many different types of communities.
