Combining theory and practice, you will comprehensively investigate the structure of the mathematics curriculum, considering numbers and algebra, shape, space and measures, and handling data. You will be encouraged to provide evidence of your own development in teaching and learning.\r\n\r\nUniversity-based sessions will enable you to reflect on teaching methods, education theories, ideas and concepts, and will enhance your awareness of current educational issues and developments. During your school practice, you will become involved in designing, producing, teaching and evaluating a range of materials currently used to support Mathematics in the secondary school. You will work with experienced mathematics teachers and will benefit from their expertise and understanding of strategies to obtain the best outcomes in teaching Mathematics at all Key Stages, enabling you to achieve QTS in secondary mathematics and prepare to teach one of the most important subjects at secondary school.","interviewProcess":"If selected you would be required to attend an interview at the host school. This will include:\r\n\r\n* a tour of the school\r\n* literacy/numeracy tests\r\n* classroom/teaching exercise\r\n* panel interview\r\n\r\nYou may be asked to teach a short segment of a lesson, in which case full details will be provided in advance. Do not worry! This is an opportunity for us to see you in a classroom setting, and we are fully aware you may have had no previous teaching experience. The lesson may not go as planned, but it's important to be honest with your thoughts when we ask you about the lesson during the subsequent interview panel.\r\n\r\nFurther details of the interview structure will be emailed as part of your interview confirmation.\r\n\r\nIf you are successful at the Stage 1 (school interview), the university will call you for Stage 2 of interview at the university. This is an ideal opportunity for you to get to know the team at Middlesex University that you will be working with during your training year, and for them to get to know you.\r\n\r\nIf you are rejected at Stage 1 (school interview), we will contact you and upload the rejection to UCAS including reasons for the rejection that you (alone) would be able to see.\r\n\r\nIf you are rejected at Stage 2 (university interview), the university will get in touch to outline the reasons for their decision.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will undertake your training across two contrasting schools. Starting in ‘School A’ your first placement lasts from September until early January, then you move to ‘School B’ in early February through to late April, returning to ‘School A’ in early May, completing your training in late June.\r\n\r\nYour training will be predominantly based at the two host schools, other than one day a week when you will be at the university (throughout most of the year).\r\n\r\nThrough an initial programme of observations and research you will become familiar with the organisation and working of the school and department (pupil groups and pastoral systems, staffing, curriculum, resources, facilities, methods of teaching, lesson planning, and assessment).\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, you will be treated like a member of the teaching staff by fellow professionals. With your departmental mentor and Professional Coordinating Mentor (PCM), you will feel supported as you progress and become ready to teach. Our mentors are experienced teachers and undertake rigorous training to develop their mentoring skills to support your development as a teacher. Your time in school provides you with the opportunity to develop your teaching expertise and relationships with children and young people in a familiar environment.\r\nYour university tutor will visit you regularly throughout your training year to monitor your progress and discuss your development with you and your mentors and you will maintain close links with other trainees in your subject across the Harrow Collegiate, through networking and subject development days.","personalQualities":"You should be:\r\n* Enthusiastic about your subject;\r\n* Able to communicate clearly in written and spoken English;\r\n* Open to advice and positive professional criticism;\r\n* Diligent, organised, smartly dressed, punctual and committed to full attendance;\r\n* Able to shoulder individual responsibility and work collaboratively;\r\n* Committed to equal opportunities;\r\n* Willing to work with pupils beyond the school day.\r\n\r\nYou should also have:\r\n* Basic computing skills, with a commitment to developing these;\r\n* Good health, physical and mental;\r\n* A sense of humour;\r\n* A vision of teaching more than just giving information or crowd control","otherRequirements":"We strongly encourage you to undertake school experience observation in UK secondary schools before applying. Although this is not mandatory, this will enable you to explore your motivation to teach, and your understanding of what teaching is like, when you are discussing this at interview.\r\n\r\nThis school experience does not need to be in the school you are applying to, but should be in the subject you are planning to teach (or a closely-related discipline).\r\n\r\nAll teacher trainees will undergo an Enhanced Criminal Records check, Health checks and Prohibition to Teach checks. Further information can be obtained at interview.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:48:44.848Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-05T10:32:57.500Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2024"}
