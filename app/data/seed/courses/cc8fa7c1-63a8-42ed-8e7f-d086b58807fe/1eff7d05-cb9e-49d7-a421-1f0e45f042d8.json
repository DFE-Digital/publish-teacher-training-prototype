It can help make sense of the world in which we live and give you a deeper knowledge of contemporary local, national and international affairs, such as those relating to climate change, sustainability or migration. This course will develop your subject knowledge for teaching geography whilst also developing the skills and knowledge required to teach other humanities based subjects. It will explore the common pedagogies of humanities based subjects whilst providing opportunities for you to develop a strong subject specialism in geography so that you can become an outstanding teacher of geography.\r\n\r\nGeography is a subject which can fascinate and inspire children. It feeds their natural curiosity and supports them in developing a sense of space and place. As such, humanities teachers are in great demand and this course appeals to graduates who are passionate about geography but want to develop the skills and understanding to teach outside their specialism.\r\n\r\nThrough this Geography with Humanities course, you will gain the understanding and skills necessary to operate as a critically reflective Geography with humanities teacher in a secondary school setting. You will also develop the awareness and ability to transfer these skills and teach in subject areas across the humanities spectrum (such as history, government and politics, citizenship or religious education).\r\n\r\nThe course gives you a strong understanding of how and why to teach geography in secondary schools whilst also enabling you to appreciate the unique aspects of other subject specialisms in order to develop your confidence in teaching across the suite of humanities subjects.","interviewProcess":"If selected you would be required to attend an interview at the host school. This will include:\r\n\r\n* a tour of the school\r\n* literacy/numeracy tests\r\n* classroom/teaching exercise\r\n* panel interview\r\n\r\nYou may be asked to teach a short segment of a lesson, in which case full details will be provided in advance. Do not worry! This is an opportunity for us to see you in a classroom setting, and we are fully aware you may have had no previous teaching experience. The lesson may not go as planned, but it's important to be honest with your thoughts when we ask you about the lesson during the subsequent interview panel.\r\n\r\nFurther details of the interview structure will be emailed as part of your interview confirmation.\r\n\r\nIf you are successful at the school interview (Stage 1), our university partner will review your application and the interview paperwork before potentially ratifying the decision. Following a review of your application, the university may call you for Stage 2 of interview at the university if there are any aspects of your application that they wish to explore further (e.g. concerns over the extent of your subject knowledge).\r\n\r\nIf you are rejected at Stage 1 (school interview), we will contact you and upload the rejection to UCAS including reasons for the rejection that you (alone) would be able to see.\r\n\r\nIf you are rejected at Stage 2 (university interview), the university will get in touch to outline the reasons for their decision.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will undertake your training across two contrasting schools. Starting in ‘School A’ your first placement lasts from September until early January, then you move to ‘School B’ in early February through to late April, returning to ‘School A’ in early May, completing your training in late June.\r\n\r\nYour training will be predominantly based at the two host schools, other than one day a week when you will be at the university (throughout most of the year).\r\n\r\nThrough an initial programme of observations and research you will become familiar with the organisation and working of the school and department (pupil groups and pastoral systems, staffing, curriculum, resources, facilities, methods of teaching, lesson planning, and assessment).\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, you will be treated like a member of the teaching staff by fellow professionals. With your departmental mentor and Professional Coordinating Mentor (PCM), you will feel supported as you progress and become ready to teach. Our mentors are experienced teachers and undertake rigorous training to develop their mentoring skills to support your development as a teacher. Your time in school provides you with the opportunity to develop your teaching expertise and relationships with children and young people in a familiar environment.\r\nYour university tutor will visit you regularly throughout your training year to monitor your progress and discuss your development with you and your mentors and you will maintain close links with other trainees in your subject across the Harrow Collegiate, through networking and subject development days.","personalQualities":"You should be:\r\n* Enthusiastic about your subject;\r\n* Able to communicate clearly in written and spoken English;\r\n* Open to advice and positive professional criticism;\r\n* Diligent, organised, smartly dressed, punctual and committed to full attendance;\r\n* Able to shoulder individual responsibility and work collaboratively;\r\n* Committed to equal opportunities;\r\n* Willing to work with pupils beyond the school day.\r\n\r\nYou should also have:\r\n* Basic computing skills, with a commitment to developing these;\r\n* Good health, physical and mental;\r\n* A sense of humour;\r\n* A vision of teaching more than just giving information or crowd control","otherRequirements":"We strongly encourage you to undertake school experience observation in UK secondary schools before applying. Although this is not mandatory, this will enable you to explore your motivation to teach, and your understanding of what teaching is like, when you are discussing this at interview.\r\n\r\nThis school experience does not need to be in the school you are applying to, but should be in the subject you are planning to teach (or a closely-related discipline).\r\n\r\nAll teacher trainees will undergo an Enhanced Criminal Records check, Health checks and Prohibition to Teach checks. Further information can be obtained at interview.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-10-05T10:05:11.529Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-05T10:30:23.196Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2024"}
