It sustains thought, development and community. As an excellent written and verbal communicator, this is your chance to strengthen young people's English skills through writing, reading, speaking and listening. Whether chairing a lively debate or navigating a class through a complex Shakespeare extract, you'll be an inspiring influence for pupils from all backgrounds.\r\n\r\nWe are passionate about language and literature in all its forms. Combining your enthusiasm for literature and communication with the educational theory and practice offered on this course, our team of experienced English teachers will equip you with the skills and experience necessary to both educate and inspire secondary English pupils. Through interactive workshops, tutorials, lectures and debates as well as hands-on teaching practice at your placement schools, this one-year full-time course enables you to meet and exceed the national standards for the award of qualified teacher status.\r\n\r\nThe course includes interrelated elements that focus on the school and classroom, language, literature and communication. Key areas addressed during the course include the teaching of literature, media aspects of English; an exploration of support for language and learning needs; and the role of Drama within English.","interviewProcess":"If selected you would be required to attend an interview at the host school. This will include:\r\n\r\n* a tour of the school\r\n* literacy/numeracy tests\r\n* classroom/teaching exercise\r\n* panel interview\r\n\r\nYou may be asked to teach a short segment of a lesson, in which case full details will be provided in advance. Do not worry! This is an opportunity for us to see you in a classroom setting, and we are fully aware you may have had no previous teaching experience. The lesson may not go as planned, but it's important to be honest with your thoughts when we ask you about the lesson during the subsequent interview panel.\r\n\r\nFurther details of the interview structure will be emailed as part of your interview confirmation.\r\n\r\nIf you are successful at the Stage 1 (school interview), the university will call you for Stage 2 of interview at the university. This is an ideal opportunity for you to get to know the team at Middlesex University that you will be working with during your training year, and for them to get to know you.\r\n\r\nIf you are rejected at Stage 1 (school interview), we will contact you and upload the rejection to UCAS including reasons for the rejection that you (alone) would be able to see.\r\n\r\nIf you are rejected at Stage 2 (university interview), the university will get in touch to outline the reasons for their decision.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Your training will be predominantly based at the host school, your employing school other than\r\n\r\n* every other Monday you will be at the university throughout the year\r\n* your second placement at another school for approx. 6 weeks in the second term, i.e. after Christmas.\r\n\r\nThrough an initial programme of observations and research you will become familiar with the organisation and working of the school and department (pupil groups and pastoral systems, staffing, curriculum, resources, facilities, methods of teaching, lesson planning, and assessment).\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, you will be treated like a member of the teaching staff by fellow professionals. With your departmental mentor and Professional Coordinating Mentor (PCM), you will feel supported as you progress and become ready to teach as the placement progresses. Our mentors are experienced teachers and undertake rigorous training to develop their mentoring skills to support your development as a teacher. Your time in school provides you with the opportunity to develop your teaching expertise and relationships with children and young people in a familiar environment.\r\n\r\nYour shorter second teaching placement is intended for you to apply and develop your teaching skills whilst also widening your experience of the school system in a new context. We would endeavour to ensure that this second school is one of our HCTSA partner schools but cannot absolutely guarantee this. Please be assured that the quality of the training will be quality assured by the HCTSA and the university. You return to your host school after this placement.\r\n\r\nWhile in your main host school and during your second placement, your university tutor will visit to monitor your progress and discuss your development with you and your mentors. You will maintain close links with your host school throughout the programme.","personalQualities":"You should be:\r\n* Enthusiastic about your subject;\r\n* Able to communicate clearly in written and spoken English;\r\n* Open to advice and positive professional criticism;\r\n* Diligent, organised, smartly dressed, punctual and committed to full attendance;\r\n* Able to shoulder individual responsibility and work collaboratively;\r\n* Committed to equal opportunities;\r\n* Willing to work with pupils beyond the school day.\r\n\r\nYou should also have:\r\n* Basic computing skills, with a commitment to developing these;\r\n* Good health, physical and mental;\r\n* A sense of humour;\r\n* A vision of teaching more than just giving information or crowd control","otherRequirements":"We strongly encourage you to undertake school experience observation in UK secondary schools before applying.

Further information can be obtained at interview.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-10-17T09:21:01.545Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-18T07:42:18.251Z","canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","cycle":"2024","salaryDetails":"The successful candidate will be paid a full-time salary by the employing host school on the non-qualified teacher pay range, at a level depending on your qualifications and experience.\r\n\r\nThe tuition fee for this course will be covered by the employing school.\r\n\r\nTrainees on salaried programmes are not eligible for bursaries or scholarships."}
