The partnership works together to develop outstanding student teachers who are transformative and creative professionals, highly motivated and committed, autonomous and independent, enquiry based practitioners and self-reflective practitioners.\r\nThe programme delivers contemporary and highly relevant education and training which provides excellent opportunities for you to develop knowledge and understanding of your subject and wider educational issues.  You will be equipped to become an outstanding teacher and leader with strong subject knowledge and a clear professional identity.  You will be supported by experts in both university and schools to ensure that you have opportunities to learn about current classroom practice and develop deep subject pedagogy.  The programme combines school experience with taught sessions on subject knowledge and pedagogy which occur at university and also in partnership schools. Two academic assignments will need to be passed so you meet the programme aims and gain the PGCE award.  These modules will underpin your own rigorous understanding of pedagogy and will provide you with 60 Masters level credits, which you may wish to use towards a full Masters qualification in the future.\r\n\r\nThe Campus Stockton Teaching Alliance PGCE School Direct programme is a full time programme studied within one academic year (September - June) and covers the 11- 16 age phase with 16-19 enhancement.  You will be based within one school for the majority of your training where you will complete two placements.  There is also a 6-week contrasting placement in a different partnership school, either in the autumn or spring term.  During these three placements, you will observe teaching, work collaboratively with experienced staff and gradually increase the percentage of your independent teaching.  Induction is a key part of the programme and each placement as we feel it is important for you to feel welcome in the school community and valued as members of staff from the start. You will attend school meetings such as staff meetings, participate in school training days and other professional development events as appropriate. You are given the opportunity to participate in all aspects of school life and the wider school context.  ","interviewProcess":"The recruitment process is rigorous and thorough. It is designed to enable Campus Stockton Teaching Alliance and York St John University to assess the suitability of candidates for training and to appoint the best candidates for the places available.  \r\n\r\nSelection is based on evidence given throughout the application process and includes:\r\n•\tYour personal statement\r\n•\tReferences\r\n•\tDetailed breakdown of degree content\r\n•\tDetails of other academic, professional or vocational qualifications\r\n•\tCompletion of a practical task at interview\r\n•\tOverall performance at interview\r\n\r\nInterview days take place in one of our partnership schools. Typical activities include a short teaching activity and an individual interview with a panel made up of Campus Stockton Teaching Alliance teaching school staff and university staff.  Candidates may also have an interview with a pupil panel and take part in a group activity and literacy-based task.\r\nPlaces on the programme are limited and recruitment takes place regularly during the year.  If you are successful at interview you will be offered a conditional place.  Once the number of offered places meets the agreed programme numbers, the programme will be closed.  We therefore recommend that you apply as soon as possible to avoid missing out on the programme of your choice.\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"School placements involve opportunities to observe teaching, to work collaboratively, and to progressively increase the percentage of independent teaching.   You will also attend school meetings e.g. staff meetings, participate in school training days and other professional development events as appropriate. You are given the opportunity to participate in all aspects of school life and the wider school context.\r\n\r\nThere is strong support provided by school staff, mentors and university staff. Campus Stockton Teaching Alliance, partner schools and the university work together to ensure that trainees become creative educators in a supportive and encouraging environment.\r\n\r\nSchool experience will closely complement taught elements of the programme, ensuring that student teachers are able to deepen their pedagogical knowledge. Student teachers will have opportunities within their school-based practice to observe young people in different subjects and will be encouraged to reflect upon their observations and related tasks within their own studies.  \r\n\r\nA strength of the school-centred programme is that it draws upon the expertise of school-based practitioners in outstanding schools and outstanding departments to support you in developing your subject knowledge and pedagogical skills.  School-based staff have been involved in the development of the programme, alongside university staff and consultants and will also be involved in delivering sessions for both subject studies and professional studies.  \r\n\r\nPartnership is at the heart of the programme with Campus Stockton Teaching Alliance, York St John University tutors, school mentors and other education professionals successfully working together to secure outstanding student teacher progress.\r\n\r\nWhilst you will be allocated to one school for the majority of your training you will also have experiences in at least one other school within the Alliance.  The progressive nature of school experience and immersion into the life of the school (which is a distinctive part of the School Direct approach) will enable you to progress effectively by building upon your developing skills as beginning teachers.  The time in school will ensure the NCTL requirement for 120 days of school-based training on secondary postgraduate courses of one year’s duration.\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for trainees with an enthusiasm not just for their subject, but to teach it to pupils in the secondary age range and who have some recent knowledge and understanding of secondary education.
