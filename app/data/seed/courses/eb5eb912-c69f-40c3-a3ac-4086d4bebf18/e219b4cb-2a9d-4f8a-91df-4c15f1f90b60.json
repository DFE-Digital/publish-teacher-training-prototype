You will then apply these areas of understanding and skill to classroom practice throughout the year.\r\n\r\nIn broad terms, the assessed school placement requires trainees to:\r\n\r\n* know the structure and requirements of the National Curriculum as they relate to teaching at KS3 and KS4 (11-16)\r\n* be able to plan, teach, assess and evaluate lessons, meeting the level of practice expected of teachers according to the Teachers' Standards (DfE 2012)\r\n* identify professional strengths and areas for development\r\n\r\nUpon successful completion of the course you will be awarded a PGCE with recommendations for the award of QTS.\r\n","interviewProcess":"As Lead in our Alliance, Ringwood School will co-ordinate the recruitment process.  This will include planning and delivering a short teaching episode, presenting to a panel on an area of teaching and learning, followed by a formal interview exploring your subject knowledge with key leaders and a representative from The University of Winchester.\r\n\r\nApplicants for Initial Teacher Education (ITE) courses are longer required to complete Skills Tests for Numeracy and English.  It is the responsibility of the ITE provider to ensure that all trainee teachers have acquired and demonstrate an appropriate proficiency in English and Mathematics before they can be awarded Qualified Teacher Status at the end of their course.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the interview process will include fundamental skills tests in English and Mathematics in the form of a reflective written task to assess your written English and a Maths audit. \r\n\r\nCandidates will attend one interview and the venue will normally be Ringwood School (except for Primary where interviews will be held in a relevant primary setting).\r\n\r\nWhere possible, a pre-visit will support the selection process and is encouraged by all partnership schools. Where a placement is at another school, staff from that school will attend interview. We would recommend that following your notification of interview you make contact with the host (main) school so that a visit can be arranged prior to your interview date. \r\n\r\nIt is a rigorous and thorough process, designed to get the best match of applicant to the places available across our partnership of schools.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Ringwood School Alliance comprises of various secondary and primary schools across Dorset and Hampshire with Ringwood School as lead. Ringwood School is centrally located on the boarder of Hampshire and Dorset within a 20 mile radius of all alliance schools.\r\n\r\nApplicants are free to decide the subject, school and route they wish to apply for via DfE Apply under the Provider Code 1G3. Where multiple schools in our Alliance have same subject places candidates need only apply to one, but can request to be considered by other schools in the Alliance depending on preference and distance.  Upon consideration of applications, interested schools attend interview at one venue (usually Ringwood School). Following a successful interview IF more than one school wish to offer a place, candidates have the final decision on their chosen school subject to having made an experience visit to all interested schools.\r\n\r\nTrainees commence their one year 'main' placement in September at the beginning of the Autumn Term and are in the classroom from the start.  A second placement of 6 weeks in a different school environment takes place from January to February half term (normally in another school within our Alliance). \r\n\r\nTrainees are based in their main school 4 days per week, teaching a percentage of the timetable and being observed in lessons (on average around once a week).  Fridays are set aside for Professional theme training either at the University of Winchester or an Alliance school. Each trainee is allocated a subject mentor and time is allocated for weekly meetings.  There is also regular support from a Professional Mentor and admin support from the School Direct Coordinator. A tutor, in the appropriate subject field, is also assigned by the University of Winchester.  \r\n\r\nThe trainee is required to complete 3 termly Review Statements and an Interim Review where required.","personalQualities":"We are looking for ambitious trainees who are enthusiastic about teaching and have a desire to share their passion with young people of all abilities.
