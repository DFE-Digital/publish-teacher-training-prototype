It is the responsibility of the ITE provider to ensure that all trainee teachers have acquired and demonstrate an appropriate proficiency in English and Mathematics before they can be awarded Qualified Teacher Status at the end of their course.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the interview process will include fundamental skills tests in English and Mathematics in the form of a reflective written task to assess your written English and a Maths audit. \r\n\r\nCandidates will attend one interview and the venue will normally be Ringwood School (except for Primary where interviews will be held in a relevant primary setting).\r\n\r\nWhere possible, a pre-visit will support the selection process and is encouraged by all partnership schools. Where a placement is at another school, staff from that school will attend interview. We would recommend that following your notification of interview you make contact with the host (main) school so that a visit can be arranged prior to your interview date. \r\n\r\nIt is a rigorous and thorough process, designed to get the best match of applicant to the places available across our partnership of schools.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Ringwood School Alliance comprises of various secondary and primary schools across Dorset and Hampshire with Ringwood School as lead.

Where multiple schools in our Alliance have same subject places candidates need only apply to one, but can request to be considered by other schools in the Alliance depending on preference and distance.  Upon consideration of applications, interested schools attend interview at one venue (usually Ringwood School). Following a successful interview IF more than one school wish to offer a place, candidates have the final decision on their chosen school subject to having made an experience visit to all interested schools.\r\n\r\nTrainees commence their one year 'main' placement in September at the beginning of the Autumn Term and are in the classroom from the start.  A second placement of 6 weeks in a different school environment takes place from January to February half term (normally in another school within our Alliance). \r\n\r\nTrainees are based in their main school 4 days per week, teaching a percentage of the timetable and being observed in lessons (on average around once a week).  Fridays are set aside for Professional theme training either at the University of Winchester or an Alliance school. Each trainee is allocated a subject mentor and time is allocated for weekly meetings.  There is also regular support from a Professional Mentor and admin support from the School Direct Coordinator. A tutor, in the appropriate subject field, is also assigned by the University of Winchester.  \r\n\r\nThe trainee is required to complete 3 termly Review Statements and an Interim Review where required.","personalQualities":"We are looking for ambitious trainees who are enthusiastic about teaching and have a desire to share their passion with young people of all abilities.
