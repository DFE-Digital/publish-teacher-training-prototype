This will include planning and delivering a short teaching episode, presenting to a panel on an area of teaching and learning, followed by a formal interview exploring your subject knowledge with key leaders and a representative from The University of Winchester.\r\n\r\nApplicants for Initial Teacher Education (ITE) courses are longer required to complete Skills Tests for Numeracy and English.  It is the responsibility of the ITE provider to ensure that all trainee teachers have acquired and demonstrate an appropriate proficiency in English and Mathematics before they can be awarded Qualified Teacher Status at the end of their course.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the interview process will include fundamental skills tests in English and Mathematics in the form of a reflective written task to assess your written English and a Maths audit. \r\n\r\nCandidates will attend one interview held in the relevant primary setting.\r\n\r\nWhere possible, a pre-visit will support the selection process and is encouraged by all partnership schools.  We would recommend that following your notification of interview you make contact with the Primary school so that a visit can be arranged prior to your interview date, if time allows.  \r\n\r\nIt is a rigorous and thorough process, designed to get the best match of applicant to the places available across our partnership of schools.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Ringwood School Alliance works with primary schools in Bournemouth and is located on the boarder of Hampshire and Dorset within a 15 mile radius of all Primary alliance schools.\r\n\r\nCandidates should apply via the DfE Apply system using our unique Provider Code 1G3, indicating the Primary school they wish to apply to by using the appropriate Course and Campus code.  Upon consideration of applications, interested schools attend interview at one venue. Following a successful interview IF more than one school wish to offer a place, candidates have the final decision on their chosen school, subject to having made an experience visit to all interested schools.\r\n\r\nTrainees commence their one year 'main' placement in September at the beginning of the Autumn Term and are in the classroom from the start.  A second placement of 6 weeks in a different Primary school within the Alliance takes place from January to February half term.\r\n\r\nTrainees are based in their main school 4 days per week, teaching a percentage of the timetable and being observed in lessons (on average around once a week).  Fridays are set aside for Professional theme training either at the University of Winchester or in an Alliance school. \r\n\r\nEach trainee is allocated a subject mentor and time is allocated for weekly meetings.  A tutor, in the appropriate subject field, is also assigned by the University of Winchester.  \r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for ambitious trainees who are enthusiastic about teaching and have a desire to share that with young people of all abilities.  We will look for evidence of a commitment to the teaching profession, an understanding of professional requirements, and an awareness of current educational issues in an application. Prior experience in a school is not required, however prospective students may find experience in a school useful for obtaining insights into the primary education classroom. Experience in a school or similar setting may also provide reassurance to prospective students that teaching is the right choice for their career.","otherRequirements":"If you accept an offer of a place you will be required to complete a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) criminal records check and Prohibition Order check.
