This will enable you to experience two different contexts where you will be able to immerse yourself in school life, working alongside established professionals to develop and build on your expertise as a teacher. \r\n\r\nThis on-the-job training will be backed up by the theoretical, pedagogical learning at University and in school-based bespoke ‘Mercia Training Days’ with the rest of the School Direct cohort. The course has been designed so that students' professional learning in the craft of teaching is grounded in sound theoretical understanding, alongside an active and practical application of that understanding within a school setting. \r\n\r\nThe course is a Postgraduate Diploma in Education (PGDE) which offers exactly the same teaching experience as a PGCE, but with additional Masters Credits, meaning that you will be able to complete your Masters as soon as you qualify as a teacher. \r\n\r\nTo complement your development as a teacher you will complete four assignments at Masters level, exploring key issues relating to your subject and your role.\r\n\r\nKey Features of the course:\r\n\r\n* A dedicated team of tutors and school based mentors who provide excellent support for all students.  \r\n* Excellent school partnerships. Our longstanding relationships with our partner schools enable us to ensure continuity for students.\r\n* A strong subject-specific cohort. You will have chance to develop working relationships with your peers whilst at Mercia training days and in university, which provide you with a support network once out on placement.\r\n* The chance to reflect. Teaching is an intensive profession, and at the start of your career it is essential that you have the opportunity to develop skills as a reflective practitioner. During your first placement, for example, you will spend every Friday in University sharing your experiences and considering ways in which you can develop your teaching.\r\n\r\nAssessment\r\nFor information about course assessment please click [here](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/education/pgde/pgce-assessment)\r\n","interviewProcess":"Upon receipt of your application, it will be looked at closely by the School Direct Lead for Mercia Learning Alliance and the Admissions team at the University of Sheffield along with your references and consider the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Do you demonstrate a clear interest in becoming a teacher?\r\n* Do you have strong references that suggest you have the capacity to train to be a teacher?\r\n* Do you have strong subject knowledge, or an awareness that you need to develop this further?\r\n* Have you written a strong personal statement, demonstrating your commitment to teaching, your passion for your subject and an understanding of the realities of the profession?\r\n\r\nWhilst school experience is not a requirement prior to interview, we tend to find that candidates are more confident during the selection process if they have spent at least some time in schools beforehand.  However, if this is not possible, you are strongly encouraged to apply for the course and arrange school experience following the selection process.  \r\n\r\nYour selection day will take place remotely using Google Meet, and will consist of the following elements:\r\n\r\n* Introduction to the course\r\n* A task designed to ensure that your subject knowledge is strong\r\n* A chance to interact with other candidates (where possible), and to reflect on this experience\r\n* A written task\r\n* A formal interview, carried out by a University tutor and a school representative\r\n\r\nYou will be sent relevant materials for the day in advance.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will undertake four periods of school experience:\r\n\r\n* One week in a primary school early in the programme\r\n* An eight-week placement between October and December\r\n* A 13-week placement between January and May\r\n* A 2-week enrichment/enhancement placement in June\r\n\r\nIn all curriculum areas you will also have the chance to visit a number of schools as a part of the University-centred parts of the PGDE. These visits will focus on specific themes such as working with pupils with EAL or supporting examination groups and will give you the opportunity to gain experience of schools beyond your main placements.\r\n\r\nWe work with a small number of partner schools in Sheffield, including:\r\n\r\n* King Ecgbert School (Lead school in Mercia Learning Alliance)\r\n* Newfield School\r\n* Wales High School\r\n* Firth Park Academy\r\n* Forge Valley School\r\n\r\n\r\nThis range of inner-city, suburban and rural contexts provides rich opportunities for diverse and balanced experiences in schools, and we work hard to secure you two contrasting placements.\r\n\r\nWhen arranging placements, personal circumstances such as child-care and additional needs are taken into account as much as possible.\r\n\r\nPlease note that although we will try to take preferences into account where possible, we cannot guarantee which of our partner schools trainees will attend until placements are finalised towards the start of the course. In applying to Mercia Learning Alliance, you are agreeing to train in any of alliance schools. \r\n","personalQualities":"At Mercia Learning Alliance we are looking for candidates to join our highly successful and aspirational, but also caring and supportive team; candidates who will deliver fresh subject expertise, energy, and new perspectives.
