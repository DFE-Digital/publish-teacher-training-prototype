This is largely provided by following the same PD programme as our school-direct trainees at College but can include other training based at your school.\r\n\r\nAfter successfully gaining QTS, you will be put forward to complete your End Point Assessment (EPA), in agreement with your employer. The EPA involves a formal observation and professional discussion conducted by an external assessor.
