The course is designed to help trainees demonstrate they have met the curriculum through planning, preparation and assessment of pupils. The programme is assessed through continual course work; there are no final exams.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Candidates take part in a selection and recruitment process designed to assess their suitability to train to teach. \r\n\r\nThe aim of the interview process is for candidates to demonstrate why they have chosen teaching as a career, demonstrate their subject knowledge and allow us to see their potential to work in in the classroom setting.\r\n\r\nIf successful, candidates will be made a conditional offer of a place on the TKAT SCITT programme, subject to all course requirements being met.\r\n\r\nCandidates will be invited to attend an interview.
