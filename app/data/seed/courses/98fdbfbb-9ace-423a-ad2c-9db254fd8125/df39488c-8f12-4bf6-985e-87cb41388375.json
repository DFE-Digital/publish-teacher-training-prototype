The programme is assessed through continual course work; there are no final exams.\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Candidates take part in a selection and recruitment process designed to assess their suitability to train to teach. \r\n\r\nThe aim of the interview process is for candidates to demonstrate why they have chosen teaching as a career and allow us to see their potential as a teacher.\r\n\r\nThe interview will take place online and the administration team will take you through a step-by-step process.\r\n\r\nIf successful, candidates will be made a conditional offer of a place on the TKAT SCITT programme, subject to all course requirements being met.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Applicants apply for their preferred school (A) placement where they will spend the majority of their training year. \r\n\r\nTrainees are required to complete a second (B) placement as part of training. \r\n\r\nThe second placement (B) will be a minimum of four to six weeks in a contrast setting. This enables us to ensure that we offer trainees a breadth of experience in their training year. Every effort is taken to place trainees in a school geographically convenient for them, without compromising their training needs.\r\n\r\nOur programme is full-time (term time only). Trainees spend four days a week in school and one day a week at their regional training hub (The Atkins Centre, Sidcup) or via online training sessions. \r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"We are seeking  well-qualified graduates who have a passion for learning and a commitment to helping children be the best that they  can be.","otherRequirements":"* Disclosure Barring Service (DBS) Enhanced clearance;\r\n* Two satisfactory references;\r\n* Recommended as medically fit to teach.\r\n\r\n(TKAT SCITT meet the cost of the Enhanced DBS, however, if an overseas check is necessary, the additional cost will be met by \r\nthe trainee).\r\n\r\nTKAT is committed to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of our students, and expects all staff, trainees and volunteers to share this commitment.  \r\n\r\n","status":2,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:53:12.312Z","canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","cycle":"2023","salaryDetails":"Trainees on the salaried route will be paid on an unqualified teachers' pay scale 1 (minimum) at the discretion of each individual employing school, and as advertised.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) fee is met by the employing school.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the Post- Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) with 60 Masters Credits (optional) is £2,000 and is met by the trainee.\r\n\r\n* Please note that salaried trainees are not eligible for student finance and therefore would need to self-fund their PGCE fee.\r\n"}
