These are supported by specially trained mentors and designated Early Career Leaders.\r\n\r\nThere is a comprehensive programme of professional development days, hosted by practicing teachers, that take place in local training venues across North, South, East and West Leeds, Harrogate, Skipton, Richmond and Northallerton. There are also mini placements spread across the year, which give trainees the opportunity to broaden their experience in a range of schools and contexts. \r\n\r\nThe main focus of the SCITT course is the in-school placement, punctuated with university sessions, professional development training sessions, mini placements for enrichment in curriculum focus areas and subject knowledge and pedagogy training. Subject specific days are taught by practising teachers in their own school.\r\n","personalQualities":"Through our selection process we look for people who are:\r\n* Passionate about making a difference to the lives and development of young people\r\n* Independent, resilient and adaptable\r\n* Friendly and approachable, with the ability to engage young people\r\n* Enthusiastic about their subject and are continuing to develop their subject knowledge\r\n* Creative and imaginative\r\n* Organised and have excellent time management skills\r\n* Reflective and strive to improve their own practice\r\n* Confident in spoken and written English to a high standard\r\n* Professional and have made a considered and informed decision to train to teach\r\n","otherRequirements":"Experience of being in a school and/or working with young people is not essential, however, it will be beneficial during the application process.
