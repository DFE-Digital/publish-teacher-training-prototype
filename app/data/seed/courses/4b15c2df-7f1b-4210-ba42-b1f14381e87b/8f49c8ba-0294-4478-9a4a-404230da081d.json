Additional financial support may be available if you’re a parent or have a disability.\r\n\r\nRed Kite offers a monthly payment schedule for those planning to self-finance.

You’ll develop your teaching skills in the classroom, enhancing your linguistic skills and knowledge of your country, its people and its culture.\r\n\r\nYou’ll learn what is assessed at each key stage; what to teach when in the curriculum and what to look for during MFL observations.\r\n\r\nWhat influences behaviour? How do you give feedback using target language? How do you re-engage disengaged students? You’ll discuss questions like these with fellow trainees and your specialist language teachers.\r\n\r\nHealth and safety on MFL school trips will be explored in detail, so that you’re confident to accompany, and lead, a group of students during one of the highlights of their school life.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Interviews are conducted on MS Teams by representatives from Red Kite Teacher Training and senior leaders from partnership schools. \r\n \r\nA plan for a pupil activity and a workload prioritisation activity will need to be prepared for the interview.\r\n\r\nYou will be given the opportunity to meet current trainees, course leaders and be offered a school experience day before or after your interview. \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Red Kite Teacher Training is one of the largest school-based providers of teacher training in North and West Yorkshire, with a partner network featuring urban and inner-city schools in places such as Harrogate, Bradford and Leeds, as well as schools in more rural parts of Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nThis ensures that travel needs can be accommodated and also that trainees can explore how their own personal skills and attributes suit different educational settings and challenges.\r\n\r\nAll trainees undertake two main placements – the first running from the Autumn term until December and the second, in a contrasting school environment, running from January until late June. These are supported by specially trained mentors and designated Early Career Leaders.\r\n\r\nThere is a comprehensive programme of professional development days, hosted by practicing teachers, that take place in local training venues across North, South, East and West Leeds, Harrogate, Skipton, Richmond and Northallerton. There are also mini placements spread across the year, which give trainees the opportunity to broaden their experience in a range of schools and contexts. \r\n\r\nThe main focus of the SCITT course is the in-school placement, punctuated with university sessions, professional development training sessions, mini placements for enrichment in curriculum focus areas and subject knowledge and pedagogy training. Subject specific days are taught by practising teachers in their own school.","personalQualities":"Through our selection process we look for people who are:\r\n* Passionate about making a difference to the lives and development of young people\r\n* Independent, resilient and adaptable\r\n* Friendly and approachable, with the ability to engage young people\r\n* Enthusiastic about their subject and are continuing to develop their subject knowledge\r\n* Creative and imaginative\r\n* Organised and have excellent time management skills\r\n* Reflective and strive to improve their own practice\r\n* Confident in spoken and written English to a high standard\r\n* Professional and have made a considered and informed decision to train to teach\r\n","otherRequirements":"Experience of being in a school and/or working with young people is not essential, however, it will be beneficial during the application process.
