These are supported by specially trained mentors and designated Early Career Leaders.\r\n\r\nThere is a comprehensive programme of professional development days, hosted by practicing teachers, that take place in local training venues across North, South, East and West Leeds, Harrogate, Skipton, Richmond and Northallerton.
