Additional financial support may be available if you’re a parent or have a disability.\r\n \r\nRed Kite offers a monthly payment schedule for those using their bursary or planning to self-finance.\r\n","aboutCourse":"The new Part-Time Maths course is an innovative, flexible, two-year part-time training programme aimed at those with family commitments who are ambitious to train in the classroom but need the flexibility to remain in work.\r\n\r\nAltogether, over the two years, trainees will have more than 120 days in school for each option. Professional learning days are included in the training days, although there may be an occasional day when Trainees are required to attend an event such as an Employment conference with peers across all programmes.\r\n\r\nOur hybrid approach to learning combines traditional classroom experiences and digital course delivery. All sessions are taught by practising teachers.\r\n\r\nTrainees follow a carefully designed plan to support their learning. The course is structured to make sure that Trainees take on classroom responsibility in a systematic manner. The programme will build your confidence, pedagogy and subject knowledge to give you the necessary skills to become an effective classroom practitioner. Trainees will become proficient in their ability to plan, deliver and assess their subject across two key stages whilst developing generic principles such as behaviour management, the use of metacognition and meeting the needs of all learners.\r\n\r\nThe part-time Maths course is QTS only. This is because the programme has extra subject-knowledge input and additional focus on practical teaching application.\r\n\r\nThis course covers curriculum design, development of teaching materials, planning classroom activities and classroom management. Trainees will work with tutors and fellow Trainees to develop innovative and exciting ways of delivering your knowledge of Maths in the 11-16 context with post 16 enhancements.\r\n\r\nThe subject specific sessions will extend subject knowledge and give Trainees the skills needed to teach Maths throughout the curriculum.\r\n\r\nThe subject specific training will cover:\r\n\r\nKS2:3 progression\r\nLesson planning\r\nMetacognition\r\nMisconceptions and effective questioning strategies\r\nAdaptive teaching strategies\r\nAssessment\r\nKS3 and GCSE curriculum planning\r\nA post-16 curriculum overview\r\nSchool.","interviewProcess":"For the foreseeable future, interviews will be held virtually on Microsoft Teams.

Our trainees can also benefit from the placements our partners can offer, which can vary from rural settings to the buzz of the city. \r\n \r\nWhen allocating main placements, we consider trainee preferences, transport and location. Our dedicated team work hard to organise placements early, giving you as much time as possible to make arrangements.\r\n \r\nAll trainees undertake two main placements. These take place in contrasting school environments. \r\n \r\nTrainees will also take part in mini placements during the course, which give trainees a unique opportunity to broaden their experience in a range of schools and contexts.\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"\r\n* Passionate about making a difference to the lives and development of young people\r\n* Independent, resilient and adaptable\r\n* Friendly and approachable, with the ability to engage young people\r\n* Enthusiastic about their subject and are continuing to develop their subject knowledge\r\n* Creative and imaginative\r\n* Good organisational skills and excellent time management skills\r\n* Reflective and strive to improve their own practice\r\n* High standards of spoken and written English\r\n* Demonstrate a professional attitude\r\n* Have made a considered and informed decision to train to teach\r\n","otherRequirements":"Experience of being in a school and/or working with young people is not essential, however, it will be beneficial during the application process.
