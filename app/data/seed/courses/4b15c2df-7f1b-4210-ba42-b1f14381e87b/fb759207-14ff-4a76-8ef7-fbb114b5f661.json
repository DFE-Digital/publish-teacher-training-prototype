Additional financial support may be available if you’re a parent or have a disability.\r\n\r\nRed Kite offers a monthly payment schedule for those planning to self-finance. For full time courses, this is £1,250 in October followed by 8 further monthly instalments of £1,000. For part time courses, for each year, an initial payment of £700 in October is due followed by 8 monthly instalments of £600.\r\n\r\n","aboutCourse":"The Primary SCITT 5-11 course provides a broad range of teaching experience across Key Stages 1 and 2. As with the 3-7 and 7-11 courses, you’ll develop the skills to teach any Primary age group once you’re qualified, but this course will give you the opportunity to experience teaching within the different Key Stages during your placements.\r\n\r\nIn the Primary year groups, creativity is at the heart of our teaching, both in the core subjects of English, Maths and Science, and across the full breadth of National Curriculum Primary subjects.\r\n\r\nYou’ll enjoy working with many inspirational teachers from across the partnership, showing you how they continuously strive to improve practice in the classroom, and enable progression across the full range of Primary year groups. You’ll also develop inspirational and innovative techniques to enthuse and engage young people.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Interviews are conducted on MS Teams by representatives from Red Kite Teacher Training and senior leaders from partnership schools. \r\n \r\nA plan for a pupil activity and a workload prioritisation activity will need to be prepared for the interview.\r\n\r\nYou will be given the opportunity to meet current trainees, course leaders and be offered a school experience day before or after your interview. \r\n\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Red Kite Teacher Training is one of the largest school-based providers of teacher training in North and West Yorkshire, with a partner network featuring urban and inner-city schools in places such as Harrogate, Bradford and Leeds, as well as schools in more rural parts of Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nThis ensures that travel needs can be accommodated and also that trainees can explore how their own personal skills and attributes suit different educational settings and challenges.\r\n\r\nAll trainees undertake two main placements – the first running from the Autumn term until December and the second, in a contrasting school environment, running from January until late June. These are supported by specially trained mentors and designated Early Career Leaders.\r\n\r\nThere is a comprehensive programme of professional development days, hosted by practicing teachers, that take place in local training venues across North, South, East and West Leeds, Harrogate, Skipton, Richmond and Northallerton. There are also mini placements spread across the year, which give trainees the opportunity to broaden their experience in a range of schools and contexts. \r\n\r\nThe main focus of the course is the in-school placement, which is where trainees spend the majority of their training year. Subject knowledge is supported by expert colleagues from across the partnership of schools as well as sessions delivered by the University and curriculum hubs in the region. These include the Computing hub, STEM learning hub, the English hub and the Maths Hub.\r\n","personalQualities":"\r\n* Passionate about making a difference to the lives and development of young people\r\n* Independent, resilient and adaptable\r\n* Friendly and approachable, with the ability to engage young people\r\n* Enthusiastic about their subject and are continuing to develop their subject knowledge\r\n* Creative and imaginative\r\n* Good organisational skills and excellent time management skills\r\n* Reflective and strive to improve their own practice\r\n* High standards of spoken and written English\r\n* Demonstrate a professional attitude\r\n* Have made a considered and informed decision to train to teach\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"Experience of being in a school and/or working with young people is not essential, however, it will be beneficial during the application process.
