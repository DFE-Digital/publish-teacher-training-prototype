The latter will also lead your university sessions, ensuring there is continuity of support throughout your training. By working in both environments, you will reflect on the links between your own teaching theory and practice. \r\n\r\nLMU training is highly rated by Ofsted, who praised the 'inclusive, welcoming and open ethos and culture created by course leaders.
