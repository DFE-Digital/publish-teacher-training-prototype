You’ll develop your subject specialist knowledge alongside hands-on classroom experience. Successful completion of your PGCE course prepares you to start your first teaching post within a secondary school setting. Our course is designed to prepare you to teach pupils in the 11-18 age range.\r\nThe course programme is divided into two main themes:\r\n•\tDeveloping Specialist Subject Knowledge\r\nYou’ll have the opportunity to develop your subject teaching in a stimulating way, using different methodologies and new technologies to inspire and engage young people. We’ll help develop your understanding of the History curriculum; how learners make progress in MFL; planning and curriculum development in MFL; examination requirements and inclusion issues in MFL.\r\n•\tSupporting Learning and Progress in the Secondary School\r\nWe’ll prepare you for the classroom, allowing you to develop your teaching skills and understanding of how to meet the needs of all learners. Themes include how young people learn, teaching and learning techniques to support pupils’ progress; behaviour management, assessment, inclusive, creative and innovative teaching methods and how to plan lessons and sequences of lessons. You will research evidence based learning theories, gain a greater understanding of current professional issues in secondary schools and begin to develop your own educational philosophy.\r\nYou’ll learn in small, friendly and supportive groups, designed to give you the confidence to succeed. Course tutors are experienced teachers and you’ll have a personal academic tutor to support you through your studies. Teaching is through workshops, tutorials and lectures, some with guest speakers, and through group work.\r\nTwo of the PGCE modules are at Master’s level and you’ll have the opportunity to continue your studies further to complete a Master’s degree, supporting your NQT year and early professional development.\r\nAssessment is typically through the completion of a range of classroom activities, written assignments, reports, personal subject audits and the development of portfolios of evidence. There are no formal examinations and the assignments are carefully designed to help you to develop your teaching practice further.\r\n","interviewProcess":"You will be shortlisted for interview based on your application.

You’ll benefit from being able to observe experienced teachers, from practical hands-on experience and from supportive mentoring to help you develop into an outstanding and successful teacher.\r\nYou’ll experience the wider role of a teacher in secondary education.
