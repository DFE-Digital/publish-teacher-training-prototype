We also have links to a local 6th form college and often arrange full or partial placements there. Trainees are placed in the schools which have capacity to offer an experienced mentor and a range of suitable classes across key stages. We take note of candidates' transport needs and, where possible, seek to place them in schools which are conveniently located based upon their individual circumstances. All trainees will have a minimum of two placement schools with a lead school which trainees return to in the summer term. We provide a Link Tutor as an additional  point of contact from the partnership. Your Link Tutor will visit you during each placement and assess your progress along with your mentor.","personalQualities":"We are looking for ambitious and committed individuals with a passion for their subject and a desire to share their enthusiasm and inspire young people.
