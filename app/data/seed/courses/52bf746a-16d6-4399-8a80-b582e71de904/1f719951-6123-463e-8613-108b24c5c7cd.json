You will have two placements in two contrasting schools across the alliance. Each placement will be in a different Key Stage. The course runs from September to June.","interviewProcess":"Your interview will take place at Castleford Academy or one of our partner schools. You will be invited to teach a small group of students using a text as stimulus, complete a series of brief literacy and numeracy tests and participate in a formal interview. The whole process will take approximately two hours. ","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Trainees follow a primary course and working with the 5 - 11 age range. Trainees are placed in the schools which have capacity to offer an experienced mentor and a range of suitable classes across two key stages.

All candidates will have two placement schools with a lead school which trainees return to in the summer term.","personalQualities":"We are looking for ambitious and committed individuals with a passion for their subject and a desire to share their enthusiasm and inspire young people. If you have these qualities coupled with a relentless focus on securing the best outcomes for young people, we would encourage you to apply to train with us.

Preferably this would be across KS1 and KS2 in a UK Primary School / setting and would equate to about 10 days in total. In addition, we value experience of working with children in contexts other than school and will take these into consideration.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:51:11.280Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-27T15:04:48.286Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2023"}
