Trainees completing this route will be qualified to teach in mainstream Primary schools or special provision schools.\r\n\r\nOver 125 days of the course will be spent in schools working alongside highly professional and well-qualified colleagues. Specific subject knowledge training will enable you to build up a strong knowledge of the full primary curriculum for Key Stage 1 & Key Stage 2.\r\n\r\nTrainee timetables are progressive in design, however, trainees are supported at all times to ensure a balance between challenge and support. \r\n\r\nProgress is monitored with your planing, teaching and assessment being observed weekly by your school-based mentor. During each placement you will also have at least one joint observation with your professional mentor. Trainees reflect on progress on a weekly basis, culminating in termly written reports produced jointly with mentors. Trainees are supported on this journey through a series of school based tasks to enable a thorough understanding of the Core Content Framework and  Teachersâ€™ Standards.\r\n\r\nThroughout the course, trainees engage with professional development training. This training takes an evidence-informed approach to teaching and learning and is delivered by lead practitioners and specialist leaders of education. \r\n\r\nCan I refresh my subject knowledge?\r\n\r\nNot everyone feels confident in teaching every subject from the outset. As a Trainee Teacher, you should identify parts of your subject knowledge you need to refresh or deepen. \r\n* We will provide free access to our online learning platform which will tailor learning around your needs.\r\n\r\nHow do I become a qualified teacher?\r\n\r\nThe award of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) is given based on how well you have met each of the Teacher Standards. Evidence gathered to substantiate each of the standards comes from all assignments, teaching files, reflections and observations completed during your training. A PGCE is awarded from the University of Manchester.","interviewProcess":"Following a successful application that meets our entry criteria, an interview will be arranged by Co-op Academies Trust which could be in person within a trust setting, or via an on-line platform.\r\n\r\nThe interview will include the following elements:\r\n -  A short pupil-based activity where we ask you to prepare a lesson walk through to discuss with the interview panel.\r\n\r\n - A hidden task revealed during the interview\r\n\r\n - A written task to assess your written communication skills\r\n\r\n - A formal interview with staff from Co-op Academies Trust","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The Primary with SEND specialism route offers placement experience in Key Stage 1, 2 and a further placement in a Special Provision school.
