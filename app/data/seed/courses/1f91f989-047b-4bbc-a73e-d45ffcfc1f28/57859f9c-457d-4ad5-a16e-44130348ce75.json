Throughout your training year you will encounter and explore different methods for using your knowledge and enthusiasm of Mathematics in order to grow into a teacher whose work inspires young minds.\r\n\r\nWe will involve you in developing your own understanding of the structure of the secondary curriculum, and you will learn how to use this as the basis from which to build consistently strong lessons.  You will learn the craft of lesson planning, creating learning-centred activities alongside a clear vision for how young minds learn.  You will be supported in learning how to assess pupil progress and how to use the results of your assessments to refine your lessons.  All our programmes help trainee teachers to channel their enthusiasm for their subject specialism into lessons which are grounded in key principles of the curriculum and a commitment to see pupils achieve.  You will explore how data is used in education to monitor and plan for progress.\r\n\r\nIn addition, you will learn how different examination boards structure their GCSE and A level papers, develop an understanding of how these are marked and model your own teaching to prepare pupils for the rigours of exams.  Importantly, you will also come to share our vision of how your subject contribute to the whole curriculum and have opportunities to explore cross curricular links working with colleagues.\r\n\r\nYour school-based experience will be underpinned by a professional development programme.  You will grow your understanding of the teaching profession and the key issues which shape educational provision for young people.  The programme provides you with constant opportunities to reflect on your professional practice and to acquire a depth of professional understanding of teaching, learning and assessment. We will ensure our high-quality NTTC curriculum will ensure you have covered the Core Content Framework for Teacher training and at the end of the course can produce a portfolio of evidence against the Teachers’ Standards to achieve QTS. \r\n\r\nYou will be supported by your mentor who will be a Mathematics specialist who understands your needs and with whom you can work in partnership to ensure you have a fantastic and fulfilling year.\r\n","interviewProcess":"What are we looking for?\r\n\r\nWe are looking for resilient people who can show that they are committed to working with young people and joining the teaching profession. We will carry out a check against the Children’s Barred list and if you are successful in your interview a full DBS check. \r\n\r\nWe are particularly interested in talking to people who have a proven track record in another industry or profession and wish to re-train as teachers.\r\n\r\nIf your previous professional experience is directly related to the subject you would like to teach, we want to hear from you.\r\n\r\nHow we select our trainees\r\n\r\nNormally, Interviews will be held at one of our academies and will involve candidates in a full day of activities designed to test suitability to teach. Candidates will be asked to take part in structured lesson observations, group exercises and have a one to one interview.  You will receive a brief from us so you know what to prepare for your interview. If we are unable to have face-to-face interviews due to Covid19 restrictions we will have online interviews. You will be asked to prepare a 10-minute activity which you will present. We will then interview you to evaluate whether you are suitable for Teacher Training.  We strongly believe that interviews should be a two-way process, so we aim to give you as much information on NTTC as possible and answer the questions we know you will have.\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We work with over 45 schools in our region, so it is vital that we make the right match between school placement and trainee.  Placements are based on where we know we can offer excellent mentoring and great opportunities to develop subject knowledge.  \r\n\r\nAll trainees follow a programme of 4 days per week in school and 1 day at college.  You will be placed at a minimum of two schools during the year which will offer you contrasting experiences of education in our region.\r\nAll trainees will gain experience teaching 11 to 16-year olds.  For those who want to develop their post 16 teaching experience we can facilitate a range of bespoke options for you to follow from 6th Forms, to a FE College.\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"Most importantly, you will be able to demonstrate why you want to work with young people and prove your commitment to your subject.\r\n","otherRequirements":"Most candidates will be able to demonstrate experience working with young people. However, we evaluate each application on a person-by-person basis and we are keen to take all your experience into account.
