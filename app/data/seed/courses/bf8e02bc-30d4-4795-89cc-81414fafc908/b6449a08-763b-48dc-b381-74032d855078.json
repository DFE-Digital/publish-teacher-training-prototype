This approach allows you the time required to embed the theory learned into your practice and explore how an effective teacher utilises cognitive science, pedagogical teaching strategies and experience to refine their teaching.\r\n\r\nAs a school-based provider, you are working with practising teachers modelling the latest effective teaching methods. You are supported, every step of the way. \r\n\r\nIn school, you will be working with your subject mentor and initial teacher training (ITT) coordinator, who ensure you have the exposure required to gain a broad understanding. \r\n\r\nA key feature of our course is the lead subject tutor (LST) role. These are experts within your subject, who work with you to build upon the introductory theory and deliver advanced sessions, really focusing your training on what excellence means, within your subject specialism. In addition to these features, you will also become a full member of the University of Leicester and have access to the full support of this establishment.\r\n\r\nOur core learning programme is delivered by current practising teachers who are experts in their field.

Your main two teaching experiences will be in two complementary secondary schools (ages 11 to 16/ 18) from across our alliance. \r\n\r\nEach placement is tailored to meet your needs and you begin teaching when you are ready. Initially, you observe a range of teachers and identify how they deliver effective lessons to a diverse range of students. Following this, you will begin completing some group work and deliver some starters and plenaries with your mentor. When you are ready, you begin team-teaching or delivering your lessons. The build-up is gradual with you teaching 7 lessons by Christmas. By the end of the course, you are delivering 12 lessons. As the course is school-based, you spend much longer in the classroom and develop at a pace that suits you. Our lead subject mentors are also on hand to provide additional support, to help you develop into the teacher you aspire to be.\r\n\r\nThe theory is drip-fed, throughout the year, with you spending 4 days in schools and 1-day learning academic theory. This allows you time to apply and embed your learning before moving on. \r\n\r\nYour subject mentor will guide and support you, as you try new ideas and see what teaching strategies work for both you and your classes. The breadth of placements provides you the opportunities, skills and experience required to become an effective practitioner who changes children’s lives.\r\n","personalQualities":"The Achieve School Direct programme is a challenging course and we aim to recruit the best.
