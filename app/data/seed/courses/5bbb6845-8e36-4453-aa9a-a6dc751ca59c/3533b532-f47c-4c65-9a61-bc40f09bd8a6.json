You can help them understand how physics is fundamental to everyday life and that it isn’t as hard to understand as its reputation might lead them to believe!\r\nYou’ll look at strategies and techniques to make the subject accessible, whether you’re leading practical experiments in electricity or introducing topics like astrophysics and nuclear physics.\r\nThis relationship, between theory and practice, alongside a variety of contrasting school experiences, ensures that you are offered a well-rounded teacher education preparing you to work in any school setting.\r\nYour course will feature a range of modules and the opportunity to get plenty of hands-on practice in local schools with support from colleagues in the school partnership and experienced University tutors. So while the PGCE is an academic qualification, the emphasis is very much on practical experience, with around two thirds of the course spent in school.\r\nThe course is taught by experienced practitioners, all of whom have been exceptional teachers and senior managers within schools.\r\n","interviewProcess":"You will be required to attend one interview at Holte School. The interviewing panel will be made of the Lead School Direct Person at Holte School, The Head of Department and a representative from BCU. Interviews include:\r\n•\texploration of curriculum knowledge\r\n•\tdiscussions about relevant experiences\r\n•\ta presentation or small teaching exercise \r\n•\twritten task\r\n\r\nWe also look for: \r\n•\tgood communication skills\r\n•\tpotential / suitability to be a good teacher\r\n•\trobustness to cope with the demands of the course\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will spend two-thirds of your time – at least 120 days – working in the main school with another short placement (5 weeks) on a second placement gaining valuable real-life experience in schools. The 120 days will be split over a minimum of two placements in art and design departments. You will gain direct teaching experience and work with experienced practitioners in the classroom. School placements are predominantly in West Midlands secondary schools in one of our school alliance. You will be assigned a trained mentor and/or a tutor while on placement, who will support and guide your work, as well as provide training and feedback.\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"Add anything relevant that relates back to your chosen course and shows how your skills will contribute towards your learning. What extra-curricular activities have you taken part in? What awards have you won? What employment or voluntary experience do you have that has helped you develop transferable skills?","otherRequirements":"Applicants must meet the Department for Education’s Initial Teacher Training criteria, which means being medically fit and successfully completing an enhanced disclosure via the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) and satisfying all other safeguarding checks required for this course.\r\nWhile not essential, you may wish to gain some school experience before attending interview.\r\nIf you are a graduate and wish to train as a teacher but your degree did not provide enough subject specific content for you to gain automatic entry, you may be required to complete a Subject Knowledge Enhancement (SKE) course.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:52:42.242Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-06T14:34:04.509Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2024"}
