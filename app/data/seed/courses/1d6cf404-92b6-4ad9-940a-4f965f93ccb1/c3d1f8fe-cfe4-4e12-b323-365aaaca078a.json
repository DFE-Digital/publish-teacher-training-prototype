Our school-centred (School Direct) PGCE primary programme is a community of learning with partnership at the heart of the programme. The partnership works together to develop outstanding teachers who are transformative and creative professionals, highly motivated and committed, autonomous and independent, enquiry-based and self-reflective practitioners. The programme delivers contemporary and highly relevant education and training which provides excellent opportunities for you to develop knowledge and understanding of primary education and wider educational issues. You will be equipped to become an outstanding teacher with strong subject knowledge and clear professional identity. You will be supported by experts in both university and schools to ensure that you have opportunities to learn about current classroom practice and develop deep subject pedagogy. The programme combines school experience with taught sessions on subject knowledge and pedagogy which occur at university and also in partnership schools. Two academic assignments will need to be passed so you meet the programme aims and gain the PGCE award. These modules will underpin your own rigorous understanding of pedagogy and will provide you with 60 Masters level credits, which you may wish to use towards a full Masters qualification in the future.\r\n\r\nYou will normally be located in one of 2-5 schools for your placements. Training takes place at the university, the Alliance and some joint training with partner Alliances.\r\n\r\nSt George's is ranked in the top 3% in the country.","interviewProcess":"You will be invited to interview at St George's Academy. The interview will generally take between a morning and a whole day, during which you will be taken through a number of elements:\r\n- a presentation\r\n- a drop in session with children\r\n- a group task\r\n- a written reflection task\r\n- an individual interview\r\nThe recruitment process is rigorous and thorough. It is designed to enable St George's and York St John University to assess the suitability of candidates for training and to appoint the best candidates for the places available.\r\nInterview days take place in one of our partnership schools. Typical activities include a short teaching activity and an individual interview with a panel made up of St George's staff and university staff. Candidates may also take part in a group activity. Places on the programme are limited and recruitment takes place regularly during the year. If you are successful at interview you will be offered a conditional place. Once the number of offered places meets the agreed programme numbers, the programme will be closed. We therefore recommend that you apply as soon as possible to avoid missing out on the programme of your choice.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The general structure is that you will be placed in a home school in term one, during which you will have a six week assessed teaching placement in the appropriate age range and class.\r\nThis will be followed by a second placement in a partner school in the spring term, where you will have a second assessed teaching placement.\r\nYou will return to your home school and have a third assessed placement during the summer term.\r\nTraining continues throughout the year, both at the university and more regularly within the Alliance.\r\nSchool placements involve opportunities to observe teaching, to work collaboratively, and to progressively increase the percentage of independent teaching. You will also attend school meetings e.g. staff meetings, participate in school training days and other professional development events as appropriate. You are given the opportunity to participate in all aspects of school life and the wider school context.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n","personalQualities":"You need commitment to, and a sense of excitement, and energy to work with children.
