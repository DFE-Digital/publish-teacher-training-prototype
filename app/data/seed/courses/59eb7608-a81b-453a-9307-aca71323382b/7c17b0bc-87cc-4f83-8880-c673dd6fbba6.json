This course aims to develop your pedagogical skills and knowledge in all aspects of the relevant curriculum, ensuring you have the very best start on your journey to becoming an outstanding teacher. Your studies will consider all aspects of teaching including: educational theory, behaviour management, assessment, pedagogy, pastoral care and a host of other areas specific to your teaching phase and discipline.\r\nThe programme aims to develop your skills progressively over the year. The training starts with observations of expert teachers over the first half term, progressing to you taking greater and more responsibility for classes as your confidence develops. Over the three terms you will go from observing lessons, to leading your own classes, guided and supported at every stage as you develop your skills. By the summer term you will be delivering up to 80% of an NQT's timetable fully prepared for your first job!\r\nYou will have two contrasting school placements during your training year. Each trainee teacher will have their own experienced classroom practitioner within both schools, who will be assigned as their individual mentor. A Professional Tutor responsible for school based pedagogical training will be based in all partnership schools. Central training will take place at Sacred Heart and at Newcastle University both of which provide an extremely high standard of facilities, including resources and IT provision. Each trainee will also be assigned a centrally based SCITT Tutor who will visit them in their school setting on a half termly basis and assess their progress.\r\nAt St Thomas More we have a lively and active drama department. We currently offer Drama from Year 9 to Year 13 and deliver both AQA GCSE and A-level courses. Students are the epicentre of the department, taking on much responsibility in leading and participating in multiple extra curricular activities including the Shakespeare Schools Festival, Whole School Musical and Performance Festivals. Many of our students go on to study drama, theatre and dance at further educational institutions, drama schools and conservatoires. ","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will spend the majority of your training year in one school placement. Here you will have the opportunity to establish yourself as part of the team within the department and the school, as well as building rapport with the students as you build up a teaching timetable. You will be supported in organising a short second school placement at another school, ensuring that the mentoring will be of equal quality. \r\nYou will begin by observing lessons, supporting the classroom teacher and you will slowly build up a teaching timetable, with free periods for reflective practise and feedback.\r\n","personalQualities":"Applicants need to be hard working, enthusiastic and self-motivated. Applicants should demonstrate their ability to motivate and enthuse students. A passion for the performing arts is essential.","otherRequirements":"Pass the professional skills tests. \r\nWhilst we would not wish to be prescriptive in the amount of experience an applicant must have spent in schools before applying, no application will be accepted where no recent, relevant experience has been gained. As a guide, 10 school 'days' may be taken as sufficient.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:14.958Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-30T14:42:15.728Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2024"}
