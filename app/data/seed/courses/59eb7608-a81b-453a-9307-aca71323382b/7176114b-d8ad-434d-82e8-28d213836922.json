This course aims to develop your pedagogical skills and knowledge in all aspects of the relevant curriculum, ensuring you have the very best start on your journey to becoming an outstanding teacher. Your studies will consider all aspects of teaching including: educational theory, behaviour management, assessment, pedagogy, pastoral care and a host of other areas specific to your teaching phase and discipline.\r\nThe programme aims to develop your skills progressively over the year. The training starts with observations of expert teachers over the first half term, progressing to you taking greater and more responsibility for classes as your confidence develops. Over the three terms you will go from observing lessons, to leading your own classes, guided and supported at every stage as you develop your skills. By the summer term you will be delivering up to 80% of an NQT's timetable fully prepared for your first job!\r\nYou will have two contrasting school placements during your training year. Each trainee teacher will have their own experienced classroom practitioner within both schools, who will be assigned as their individual mentor. A Professional Tutor responsible for school based pedagogical training will be based in all partnership schools. Central training will take place at Sacred Heart and at Newcastle University both of which provide an extremely high standard of facilities, including resources and IT provision. Each trainee will also be assigned a centrally based SCITT Tutor who will visit them in their school setting on a half termly basis and assess their progress.\r\n\r\nThe Music Department has a highly innovative approach to music teaching.  The subject is taught on a wholly practical basis with all pupils given an instrument to play through Years 7-9.  Pupils rehearse as String, Wind and Brass ensembles in their music lessons.  We have a very high success rate at GCSE and A Level, offering both Music and Music Technology in KS5.  In recent years a high proportion of our 6th form pupils have gone on to study Music either at University or Conservatoire.  \r\nAll department members are actively involved in Teaching and Learning research, with the current HoD currently completing PhD studies in motivation and musical learning.  We are therefore ideally placed to support both the practical and academic side of music teacher training.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will spend the majority of your training year in one school placement. Here you will have the opportunity to establish yourself as part of the team within the department and the school, as well as building rapport with the students as you build up a teaching timetable. You will be supported in organising a short second school placement at another school, ensuring that the mentoring will be of equal quality. \r\nYou will begin by observing lessons, supporting the classroom teacher and you will slowly build up a teaching timetable, with free periods for reflective practise and feedback.\r\n","personalQualities":"We have extensive extra-curricular provision.  There is a large orchestra, jazz band, a number of student run chamber ensembles, including an auditioned Chamber, Senior and Junior Choir.  We put on at least 7 concerts per year.  We work closely with the Drama Department and each year stage a whole school production; this year’s is Oliver!, and in recent years we have produced Chicago, Les Miserables and Fame.  Trainee teachers are actively encouraged to get involved in leading these ensembles, and with all members of staff highly experienced conductors we can offer strong support in this area of music teaching.","otherRequirements":"Pass the professional skills tests. \r\nWhilst we would not wish to be prescriptive in the amount of experience an applicant must have spent in schools before applying, no application will be accepted where no recent, relevant experience has been gained. As a guide, 10 school 'days' may be taken as sufficient.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:15.241Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-30T14:49:12.603Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2024"}
