We offer the School Direct route to PGCE. Further information can be found at [OAT](https://www.olympustrust.co.uk/Careers/Get-Into-Teaching/) \r\nAt Cabot Learning Federation (CLF) you will attend sessions on how to teach all the National Curriculum subjects at KS1 and KS2. You will be taught how to teach literacy (including phonics) and numeracy to all years. You will learn how to plan lessons and employ the main pedagogical and developmental theories relating to the delivery to primary age pupils. You will learn in a group with other trainees who are following CLF SCITT route or training with other school-based providers allowing you share your own experiences and to learn from their experiences in other schools. These are supportive and practical sessions.  \r\nAt OAT you will attend sessions focused on Professional Development, learning all you need to know as a teacher about e.g. safeguarding; behaviour management; how to meet the needs of pupils with Special Educational Needs; assessment, marking and giving good quality feedback; lesson planning; working with parents and other professionals; how to manage workload and keep healthy etc. These sessions and lively, interactive and delivered so you also pick up ideas to use in your lessons in school. They are taught by teachers with many years of classroom experience. \r\nYou will teach for a minimum of 120 days in two of our schools, although in reality, this is often in excess of 130 days, as we organise our course to maximise your learning in our school settings. You will begin with observing teaching and work your way towards a full 80% teaching load over the year. However, it is not a race! We encourage you to develop at your own speed, focusing on delivering outstanding teaching as you slowly increase your contact time. \r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"If your academic qualifications are appropriate, your personal statement is convincing (and accurate in terms of grammar) and your references supportive, you will be called to interview.  Interviews will take place in one of our schools*. \r\n\r\nTypically, an interview day consists of:\r\n- working with groups of students\r\n-the opportunity to talk with students/staff\r\n-interview tasks to complete\r\n-an individual interview\r\n-the opportunity to demonstrate subject knowledge \r\n\r\nWe also include:\r\n-a tour of the school \r\n-a group discussion\r\n-a presentation\r\n\r\nYou will be interviewed by one of our ITT co-ordinators and either the Headteacher or Head of Department from the school you are interviewed at. If you need to prepare any materials you will be informed of this beforehand, however, we make no apologies for asking you to sometimes ‘think on your feet’; this is an essential skill you will need for teaching! You will be told if you are going to be offered a place as soon as we have decided – often by the following day.\r\nIt is a rigorous process, but we want to choose the best candidates to train at the Olympus Academy Trust.  We want prospective teachers who are enthusiastic and passionate about their subject, committed to a career in teaching and ready to face the challenges of the training year.\r\n\r\n*During these unprecedented times – we may face  further restrictions on entry into schools or  further lockdowns. If this is the case, we will continue to recruit, but will run interviews remotely.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We select your teaching placements by considering your strengths, attributes and skills for your first placement. When we have got to know you a little more we then carefully select your second placement to allow you to develop still further. \r\nAll our schools are within South Gloucestershire, the furthest being 16 miles from our lead school, Bradley Stoke Community School, however, most are within 15 minutes travelling time. They vary from urban, suburban to rural in nature.\r\nAll schools are comprehensive and mixed schools with our primaries covering Early Years to Y6 and all our secondaries are 11-18 and almost all have Post 16 provision. We have 11 secondary schools and 9 primary schools. You will spend at least 120 days in school over the year – often very much more than this as we are deeply committed to a schools-based training programme. \r\nYou will be placed in two schools over your training, generally in two separate, consecutive blocks of time.\r\nThese are the schools we work with at Secondary– links to their websites and a brief description of each school is available on our website [OAT](https://www.olympustrust.co.uk/Careers/Get-Into-Teaching-18072017113556/) \r\n","personalQualities":"","otherRequirements":"","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:52:31.793Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-07T11:47:54.261Z","canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","cycle":"2024","applicationsOpenDateOther":"2021-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","salaryDetails":"This will be arranged with your school."}
