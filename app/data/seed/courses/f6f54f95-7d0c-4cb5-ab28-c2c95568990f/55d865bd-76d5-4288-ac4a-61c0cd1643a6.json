Humanities subjects give an insight into everything including the past, places and people's beliefs and Religious Education is a big part of this of this. As a Religious Education teacher you will cover a range of beliefs and values, alongside the development of skills and strategies central to the study of RE. As a trainee RE teacher, you'll develop the skills to devise and deliver lessons that excite and intrigue pupils. These will intertwine with their wider learning in other subjects, as well as their understanding of society, culture, and what it means to be human. A career in teaching RE offers you the chance to tackle challenging, thought-provoking topics with young people. You can use your creativity and passion for the subject to develop lessons that help your pupils collaboratively discuss and answer the most fundamental questions. \r\n\r\n[Woodrush TC](https://www.woodrush.org/page/?title=About+School+Direct&pid=187)","interviewProcess":"Application forms are considered by both the university and the individual schools involved with Woodrush Training Consortium. \r\nAll successful applicants will have an interview and although this normally takes place at Woodrush Training Consortium, due to COVID interviews are being conducted online.
