The programme combines the theories of learning and teaching, alongside developing practical insights and skills in the effective teaching and assessment of young students in Drama. The course will help you to develop and refine the skills which you will need to become an effective Drama teacher, to inspire the next generation of students to reach higher levels of attainment. \r\n\r\nDrama involves a variety of skills and theories in every lesson. Drama not only inspires students, it allows them to feel comfortable and confident in their surroundings, and thus is a key part of education. It is imperative that all teachers are able to provide a safe and effective learning environment as well as producing innovative and creative ways of teaching Drama. \r\n\r\n[Woodrush TC](https://www.woodrush.org/page/?title=About+School+Direct&pid=187)","interviewProcess":"Application forms are considered by both the university and the individual schools involved with Woodrush Training Consortium. \r\nAll successful applicants will have an interview and although this normally takes place at Woodrush Training Consortium, due to COVID interviews are being conducted online.
