Here at Woodrush we teach Fashion & Textiles, Product Design and Food & Nutrition. \r\n\r\nAs a D&T teacher, you'll nurture pupils' creativity and teach them the skills to not only come up with brilliant ideas, but to turn them into a reality. By doing so, you'll be teaching a subject that complements their wider learning and brings it to life in practical terms from maths and science to computing and art. \r\n\r\nYou'll encourage pupils to be resourceful, innovative and enterprising as they solve real and relevant problems. This means developing the essential skills young people need for everyday life, and unlocking their ability to be the designers and innovators of tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThere are 4 assignments across the year which are assessed in a variety of ways.  Assignments at Level 6: writing and acting on a series of Action Plans and a written assignment reflecting on first experiences in school.  Assignments at Level 7: Creating, implementing and evaluating a resource used in the classroom, and, researching an aspect of teaching and learning and presenting the findings.\r\n\r\n[Woodrush TC](https://www.woodrush.org/page/?title=About+School+Direct&pid=187)\r\n","interviewProcess":"Application forms are considered by both the university and the individual schools involved with Woodrush Training Consortium. \r\nAll successful applicants will have an interview and although this normally takes place at Woodrush Training Consortium, due to COVID interviews are being conducted online.
