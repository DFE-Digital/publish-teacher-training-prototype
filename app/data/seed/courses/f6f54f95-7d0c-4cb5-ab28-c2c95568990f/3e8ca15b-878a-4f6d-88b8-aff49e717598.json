It brings us a knowledge of the world around us from the smallest features inside atoms to the enormous distances between far-off galaxies. Teaching Physics requires not only a high level of subject knowledge, but also the ability to communicate the elegant theories of Physics to a wide range of ages and abilities. In addition, there is tremendous scope for both practical demonstration and investigation to bring to life in the classroom the ideas which are covered on the pages of the text books. \r\n\r\nThe course will help you to develop and refine the skills which you will need to become an effective Physics teacher, to inspire the next generation of students to reach higher levels of attainment and gain valuable grounding in a subject which will, in turn, allow them to pursue a great variety of career and life paths. \r\nOn the Physics School Direct programme you will gain experience of teaching all three Science subjects, specifically Physics at A-level. \r\n\r\n[Woodrush TC](https://www.woodrush.org/page/?title=About+School+Direct&pid=187)","interviewProcess":"Application forms are considered by both the university and the individual schools involved with Woodrush Training Consortium. All successful applicants will have an interview and although this normally takes place at Woodrush Training Consortium, due to COVID interviews are being conducted online. The University and Woodrush jointly design and manage the interview process with the school leading the process. Your interview will consist of a written task, a presentation and a formal interview.\r\n\r\nApplicants that demonstrate professionalism, commitment, a realistic understanding of the pressures of the course and the profession, an awareness of the school in which they are intending to train, creativity, organisational skills and a clear recognition of the need to synthesise practical and academic learning through refection are most likely to succeed.\r\n\r\n[Woodrush TC](https://www.woodrush.org/page/?title=About+School+Direct&pid=187)","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Your placement school will primarily be selected on where there are vacancies for your subject.
