A new language exposes students to a new culture and provides many opportunities to develop into a global citizen. As a trainee within the Woodrush Training Consortium you will have access to outstanding classroom practitioners who strive for outstanding outcomes for students. You will be supported throughout your training through our consortium and University partner, to develop pedagogical approaches to inspire the next generation of linguists. \r\n\r\n[Woodrush TC](https://www.woodrush.org/page/?title=About+School+Direct&pid=187)","interviewProcess":"Application forms are considered by both the university and the individual schools involved with Woodrush Training Consortium. \r\nAll successful applicants will have an interview and although this normally takes place at Woodrush Training Consortium, due to COVID interviews are being conducted online. The University and Woodrush jointly design and manage the interview process with the school leading the process. Your interview will consist of a written task, a presentation and a formal interview.\r\n\r\nApplicants that demonstrate professionalism, commitment, a realistic understanding of the pressures of the course and the profession, an awareness of the school in which they are intending to train, creativity, organisational skills and a clear recognition of the need to synthesise practical and academic learning through refection are most likely to succeed. \r\n\r\n[Woodrush TC](https://www.woodrush.org/page/?title=About+School+Direct&pid=187)","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Your placement school will primarily be selected on where there are vacancies for your subject.

Woodrush TC partner with over twenty schools in and across the Midlands and these can all be found at www.woodrushtc.co.uk.\r\n\r\nWe have listed the locations that our partner schools will be running placements for the next year. You should indicate your preference of location on your application, this does not guarantee you will be placed at your preferred location. Throughout the year a schools staffing may change and therefore a school not listed may become available in your subject. \r\n\r\n[Woodrush TC](https://www.woodrush.org/page/?title=About+School+Direct&pid=187)","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-09-30T09:33:49.941Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-30T09:34:29.007Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2023"}
