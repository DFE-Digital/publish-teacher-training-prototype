A new language exposes students to a new culture and provides many opportunities to develop into a global citizen.

You will be supported throughout your training through our consortium and University partner, to develop pedagogical approaches to inspire the next generation of linguists. \r\n\r\n[Woodrush TC](https://www.woodrush.org/page/?title=About+School+Direct&pid=187)","interviewProcess":"Application forms are considered by both the university and the individual schools involved with Woodrush Training Consortium. \r\nAll successful applicants will have an interview and although this normally takes place at Woodrush Training Consortium, due to COVID interviews are being conducted online. The University and Woodrush jointly design and manage the interview process with the school leading the process. Your interview will consist of a written task, a presentation and a formal interview.\r\n\r\nApplicants that demonstrate professionalism, commitment, a realistic understanding of the pressures of the course and the profession, an awareness of the school in which they are intending to train, creativity, organisational skills and a clear recognition of the need to synthesise practical and academic learning through refection are most likely to succeed. \r\n\r\n[Woodrush TC](https://www.woodrush.org/page/?title=About+School+Direct&pid=187)","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Your placement school will primarily be selected on where there are vacancies for your subject.
