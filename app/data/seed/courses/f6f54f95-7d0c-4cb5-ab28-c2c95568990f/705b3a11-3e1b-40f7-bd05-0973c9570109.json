It plays a vital role in promoting physical activities and a healthy lifestyle in a positive and enjoyable way for all students. As a PE teacher, you'll be responsible for honing pupils' abilities in a range of physical activities and sports helping them to develop their personal fitness and learn important life skills. As a PE teacher you will have the opportunity to increase the physical competence, health-related fitness, self-responsibility and enjoyment of physical activity for all students so that they can be physically active for a lifetime. You may also have the opportunity to teach the next great Olympian! \r\n\r\nBy training to teach PE, you'll learn a wide range of skills you can take into your new career and that will have a positive influence on inspiring the next generation. These range from teaching pupils about teamwork and getting involved in your placement schools' sports teams, to learning how to manage classes during outdoor and indoor physical activities. \r\n\r\nThere are 4 assignments across the year which are assessed in a variety of ways.  Assignments at Level 6: writing and acting on a series of Action Plans and a written assignment reflecting on first experiences in school.  Assignments at Level 7: Creating, implementing and evaluating a resource used in the classroom, and, researching an aspect of teaching and learning and presenting the findings.\r\n\r\n[Woodrush TC](https://www.woodrush.org/page/?title=About+School+Direct&pid=187)","interviewProcess":"Application forms are considered by both the university and the individual schools involved with Woodrush Training Consortium. \r\nAll successful applicants will have an interview and although this normally takes place at Woodrush Training Consortium, due to COVID interviews are being conducted online.
