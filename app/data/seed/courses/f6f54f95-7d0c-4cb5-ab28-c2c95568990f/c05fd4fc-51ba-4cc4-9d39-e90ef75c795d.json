The teaching of music extends everyday experiences, providing opportunities and links between home, school and other outside agencies. Music stimulates the acquisition of the skills, attitudes and attributes needed for life such as listening skills, concentration, aural memory, presentation and teamwork. It also develops creativity, risk-taking, intuition, sensitivity, perseverance and a sense of achievement and enjoyment. A Music teacher should aim to provide pupils with stimulating, challenging work covering a variety of types and styles of music from different times and places. The programme combines the theories of learning and teaching, alongside developing practical insights and skills in the effective teaching and assessment of young students in Music. It is imperative that all teachers are able to provide a safe and effective learning environment as well as producing innovative and creative ways of teaching Music. \r\n\r\n[Woodrush TC](https://www.woodrush.org/page/?title=About+School+Direct&pid=187)","interviewProcess":"Application forms are considered by both the university and the individual schools involved with Woodrush Training Consortium. \r\nAll successful applicants will have an interview and although this normally takes place at Woodrush Training Consortium, due to COVID interviews are being conducted online.
