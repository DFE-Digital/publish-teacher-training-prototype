Teaching Biology requires a great passion for the subject and an ability to make the more abstract concepts of biology appear real. Biology is a science which is advancing rapidly with advances in healthcare and genetics, for example, continually being made and so a Biology teacher needs to keep up to date, to bring recent developments into their teaching to help inspire the next generation of nurses, doctors, and biologists. The ability to differentiate to challenge the most able and to simplify concepts for others so that they can slowly build up an image of how organisms are structured and how their structure relates to the biological functions is key and teachers need to be able to apply maths and practical skills to bring the subject to life.\r\n\r\n[Woodrush TC](https://www.woodrush.org/page/?title=About+School+Direct&pid=187)","interviewProcess":"Application forms are considered by both the university and the individual schools involved with Woodrush Training Consortium. \r\nAll successful applicants will have an interview and although this normally takes place at Woodrush Training Consortium, due to COVID interviews are being conducted online. The University and Woodrush jointly design and manage the interview process with the school leading the process. Your interview will consist of a written task, a presentation and a formal interview.\r\n\r\nApplicants that demonstrate professionalism, commitment, a realistic understanding of the pressures of the course and the profession, an awareness of the school in which they are intending to train, creativity, organisational skills and a clear recognition of the need to synthesise practical and academic learning through refection are most likely to succeed. \r\n\r\n[Woodrush TC](https://www.woodrush.org/page/?title=About+School+Direct&pid=187)\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Your placement school will primarily be selected on where there are vacancies for your subject.
