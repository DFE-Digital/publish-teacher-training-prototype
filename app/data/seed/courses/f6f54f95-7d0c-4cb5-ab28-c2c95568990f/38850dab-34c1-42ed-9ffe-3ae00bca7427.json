It is the study of the composition, properties and behaviour of matter and is concerned with atoms and their interactions with other atoms. Teaching chemistry is a massive challenge that requires great talent, but the rewards are equally great. \r\n\r\nChemistry is one of the few subjects that allows scope for activities that inspire genuine awe and wonder in the classroom. The course will help you develop the skills to excel as a chemistry teacher, teach chemistry with differing degrees of complexity to a wide range of students, consider how best to provide an environment for effective teaching and learning, work at enhancing your own knowledge and understanding of chemistry, develop strategies for effectively communicating chemical concepts to students, prepare and critically evaluate resources for the teaching of chemistry. \r\n\r\nOn the Chemistry School Direct programme you will gain experience of teaching all three Science subjects, specifically Chemistry at A-level. \r\n\r\nThere are 4 assignments across the year which are assessed in a variety of ways.  Assignments at Level 6: writing and acting on a series of Action Plans and a written assignment reflecting on first experiences in school.  Assignments at Level 7: Creating, implementing and evaluating a resource used in the classroom, and, researching an aspect of teaching and learning and presenting the findings.\r\n\r\n[Woodrush TC](https://www.woodrush.org/page/?title=About+School+Direct&pid=187)","interviewProcess":"Application forms are considered by both the university and the individual schools involved with Woodrush Training Consortium. \r\nAll successful applicants will have an interview and although this normally takes place at Woodrush Training Consortium, due to COVID interviews are being conducted online. The University and Woodrush jointly design and manage the interview process with the school leading the process. Your interview will consist of a written task, a presentation and a formal interview.\r\n\r\nApplicants that demonstrate professionalism, commitment, a realistic understanding of the pressures of the course and the profession, an awareness of the school in which they are intending to train, creativity, organisational skills and a clear recognition of the need to synthesise practical and academic learning through refection are most likely to succeed.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Your placement school will primarily be selected on where there are vacancies for your subject.
