Thursday is your academic afternoon where either professional or subject studies sessions take place. When you return to you home school after Easter, you will be in school for the full 5 day week.  \r\n\r\nYour studies gradually build from observing teachers and lessons to working with your mentor in team planning and teaching until by the end of the course, you are teaching 60% of a full timetable. At all times, there will be the classroom teacher available to support you nearby. \r\n\r\nYou will gain experience of parents evenings, clubs and many other after school events that make up the life of a teacher. \r\n\r\nThe course focuses on the teaching and learning of KS1 and KS2 students and you will be assessed on your teaching of classes from these key stages. However, because of Kent and Medway’s unique education system you may also be given the opportunity to experience pre-school teaching.\r\n\r\nTo aid your development, you will have one formal lesson observation and one dedicated mentor meeting each week. This is where you sit with your school mentor, discuss your progress and make targets for the following week. Their work is enhanced further by KMT lead mentors and course directors who further oversee and support all aspects of your studies.\r\n\r\nThroughout the year, you will be building up a portfolio of evidence demonstrating your progress towards meeting the \"Teaching Standards.\" Academic research is through the completion of Reflective, Practical essays and Evaluations  and these are spread across the academic year. \r\n\r\nIn addition, for those wishing to top up their qualification to PGCE, you will have other assignment to complete at various times through the year as published by the University of Leeds Beckett. This course is delivered through a distance-learning package and training will take place in your local hub- training centre. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"To be considered for interview, we need a completed application form.\r\nOnce received, your application is sent to your chosen campus for their consideration.\r\n\r\nIf selected for interview, a date will be arranged where you will;  \r\n\r\n- undertake a formal face to face interview with the school's Professional Tutor and a representative from Kent and Medway Training at your chosen school.  \r\n\r\n- During this, you will be required to give a presentation to the interview panel following instructions that will be provided within the interview invitation\r\n\r\n- undertake an audit of Maths and English skills \r\n\r\nYou will be given a conditional offer only if all members of the panel agree to the placement.
