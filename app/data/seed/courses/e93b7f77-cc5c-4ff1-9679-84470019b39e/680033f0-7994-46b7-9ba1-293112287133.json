This consists of:\r\n* An interview with Harris ITE Tutors where you will teach a 5-minute starter (that you have planned in advance) and a formal interview where you will answer some questions designed to assess your suitability to train to teach;\r\n* A group discussion; \r\n* Two independent written tasks designed to assess your subject/phase knowledge and your understanding of professionalism.\r\n\r\nWe will also be assessing your English proficiencies and collecting your eligibility documents for verification.\r\n\r\nPlease be prepared to bring any ID documents and original qualification certificates we request from you.\r\n\r\nIf you have been successful at first interview, we will organise a visit to your potential placement school where you will be interviewed by the Principal or Senior Leader.

","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"In order to ensure a well-rounded School Direct experience, you will undertake two school placements. You will be placed at your main placement academy for the majority of the year.\r\n\r\nAt your main placement academy, you will have your own personal mentor – an experienced teacher who will oversee the school-based element of your training year. They will support you, be a model of effective practice, observe your practice and meet with you weekly. \r\n\r\nYou will also benefit from a short second placement at a different Harris academy or partner school. This means you can experience teaching in a contrasting school, to help you to develop your skills in a different context or age-range. We organise this based on a range of criteria to ensure an enriching school experience.\r\n\r\nDuring the course you will spend one day a week at Core Training with your fellow trainees at Harris Initial Teacher Education, largely based at Harris Academy Bermondsey in South East London. \r\n\r\nOur Primary courses cover the age range 3-11 and our Secondary courses cover 11-16. This means you will have experience across these age ranges. There are also opportunities for trainees to teach at Key Stage 5, if appropriate to their subject. \r\n\r\nWhen selecting your main school placement academy we take in to consideration the distance from your home, childcare or caring responsibilities, mode of transport and any other pertinent information. Please note, once you have accepted an offer, we are unable to make changes to the main placement academy.\r\n\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"We're looking for people who want to become outstanding teachers; people for whom teaching is a passion and who will be relentless in securing academic and aspirational progress for every child.
