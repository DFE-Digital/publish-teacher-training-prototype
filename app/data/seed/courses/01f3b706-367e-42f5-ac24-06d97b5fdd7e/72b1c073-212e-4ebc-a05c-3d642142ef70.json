Similar to School Direct (salaried) programmes, Postgraduate Teaching Apprenticeships are a new, nationally-recognised, work-based route into teaching. In addition to working towards Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) on successful completion of the course, apprentices will also complete an end point assessment (EPA) after the summer to consolidate learning from initial teacher training.\r\n \r\nPlease note that gaining a place on this route does not guarantee a sponsoring school. It is your responsibility to make sure that you have a sponsoring school.\r\n\r\nAs a trainee with St John Vianney (Lead school) you will be training in one of the 30 primary schools in Hartlepool under the Together to Succeed Alliance alongside the school who has agreed to sponsor your trainee and provide your salary.\r\n\r\nAs a trainee with St John Vianney, you will have designed for you a personalised programme which is tailored to your training needs and development.  \r\n\r\nThis will include accessing Durham University’s PGCE Course and their comprehensive academic programme which will provide you with an excellent range of teaching and learning strategies and a broad curriculum knowledge.  You will have access to both Core and all Foundation subjects which are studied in depth.\r\n\r\nIn addition to your weekly days in school, you will complete block placements throughout the year. Your Preliminary placement will be in two blocks: one of four weeks and a second of three weeks ( in a school not your host school) These will take place before and after Christmas. \r\n\r\nYour main teaching placement will begin around Easter, in your school supporting your training. Your assessed teaching block will last for ten weeks but you will continue to work at this school until the end of the academic year and into the new academic year in order to complete the EPA\r\n\r\nAs part of the course, in Partnership with Durham University, will be expected to submit assignments relating to your learning and development. These three submissions are at Masters level. These submissions are assessed by University tutors and staff.  The University Progress board will also make the final recommendation for QTS at the end of the course.","interviewProcess":"Please note that gaining a place on the apprentice route does not guarantee a sponsoring school to support.
