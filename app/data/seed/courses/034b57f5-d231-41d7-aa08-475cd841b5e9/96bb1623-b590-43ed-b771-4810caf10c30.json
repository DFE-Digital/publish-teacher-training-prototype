On a Tuesday morning you will attend cross-phase taught sessions at our Learning Hub. These sessions are designed to give you an understanding of the elements of your professional role that lie outside of the national curriculum. These sessions are delivered by a range of speakers who are experts in their field. \r\n\r\nYou will also attend subject specific twilight taught sessions to assist you with planning, assessing and delivering the national curriculum. These sessions will examine the particular nature of learning in your subject area and will be delivered by subject specialists from our partnership of schools.\r\n\r\nAs this is a school-led programme, you will spend the majority of your time in school learning from excellent practitioners. You will start by observing good practice in your placement school before starting to team teach alongside your designated school based trainer. You will then have the opportunity to  deliver solo lessons before you begin your assessed teaching practice on a 50% timetable.\r\n\r\nDuring your school placements you will be supported by your School Based Trainer (SBT) and a Professional Tutor (PT). You will have a weekly one-to-one with your SBT and regular meetings with your PT in order to review progress against the Teachers' Standards.
