You will also have a three-week placement in a contrasting school to help to broaden your experience.\r\n\r\nYou will be in schools for at least four days and a half a week where you will be involved in observations, teaching, staff training, parents’ evenings, school meetings, extra-curricular clubs: all the facets of a teacher’s school life. On Thursday afternoons, you will have your pedagogical training with KMT that provides a mixture of specific Subject Studies, looking at aspects of teaching your specialism, and the more general Professional Studies sessions, which have a holistic approach to educational practices. After Easter, you will be in school full time.\r\n\r\nYou will be supported by a network of established professionals, including a subject mentor in your school, usually a subject specialist, your professional tutor, your KMT lead mentor and course director as well as the other teachers and trainees in your school. You will have a weekly mentor meeting to allow you discuss any issues and organise any  support you may need.\r\n\r\nYou will have your own classes and an established timetable. You will focus on teaching KS4 and KS5. You will be formally observed once a week in order to receive feedback and make progress.\r\n\r\nAs well as your teaching, you will be working on charting you development and recording your skills through progress trackers, Reflective Practice Assignments. You are being assessed against the 8 Teachers Standards. Evidence to prove that you are working towards meeting the Standards is collected throughout the year through your day to day practice. \r\n\r\nIn addition, for those wishing to obtain the Professional Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) as well as Qualified Teacher Status (QTS), you will be able to top up your qualification by paying an extra fee and completing other assignments throughout the year through distance learning with the University of Leeds Beckett.\r\n","interviewProcess":"A structured interview forms a core part of every recruitment process. Non-salaried trainees will be required to give a presentation to the interview panel following instructions that will be provided within the interview invitation. For salaried trainees an interview involving planning and teaching a lesson will be required as part of the suitability assessment criteria.\r\n\r\nA training provision checklist will be provided to candidates prior to the interview for them to read through. A short period of time will be allocated at the start of the interview to allow the candidates to ask any questions they may have in relation to the training provision offered by Kent and Medway Training (KMT).\r\n\r\nSuccessful interviews have a clear structure which helps keep the panel objective and focused throughout. However, this must allow flexibility and the necessary freedom for skilled interviewers to use probing, supplementary and additional questions as required to ascertain the candidate's resilience and dedication to teaching.\r\n\r\nAn interview format should cover:\r\n• initial meeting between the candidate and the Hub Director to discuss the training provision;\r\n• an introductory opening when the interview panel joins;\r\n• a schedule of questions which are asked by panel members;\r\n• space for candidates to raise any issues or ask their own questions;\r\n• the close of the interview, explanation of what will happen next.\r\n\r\nThe candidate will also be asked to sit KMT entrance tests.\r\n\r\nIf the candidate is successful at interview, a conditional offer will be made\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will have a ‘home’ school which is where you will spend the majority of your training year. Here, you will be learning how to teach your subject by teaching classes, getting weekly feedback and weekly pedagogical sessions at KMT. You will be supported by other members of your department, your mentor and your Professional Tutor.\r\n\r\nYou will also have a three-week placement in a contrasting school. For example, from a High School to a Grammar School or a single-sex school to a co-educational school. This will usually take place between February and Easter but may happen after the exam classes have left later in the year.\r\n\r\nIn April and May, you will be finally assessed through both lesson observation and your completed portfolio to ensure that you have met the Teachers’ Standards. The grades are then externally moderated and, if all the elements are completed to a good standard, your Newly-Qualified Teacher (NQT) status is confirmed and celebrated at a local hub-centred Awards Evening.\r\n","personalQualities":"•\tStrong and dedicated professionals\r\n•\tResilient\r\n•\tProactive and creative\r\n•\tOpen to feedback and guidance\r\n•\tPassionate about developing pupil learning and well being\r\n•\tStrong in their subject knowledge\r\n•\tPositive in their communication skills\r\n•\tGenuinely aiming to become an outstanding practitioner\r\n•\tEnjoy working with children and young adults to enable them better\r\n        life opportunities\r\n","otherRequirements":"School Direct Salaried is primarily aimed at career changers with three or more years’ work experience. \r\n\r\nBefore the course begins, you will need:\r\n\r\n* at least 10 experience days in a secondary school or academy (if School and Government Guidelines allow)\r\n* at least 2 experience days in a primary school or academy (if School and Government Guidelines allow)\r\n* DBS check\r\n* Health check declaration\r\n\r\nIt is useful to attend at least one school experience day or informal chat with a school representative before applying so that you can get a feel for the chosen school.\r\n","status":2,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:51:03.080Z","canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","cycle":"2024","salaryDetails":"Salaried Trainees are paid according to the Unqualified Teacher Pay Scale.\r\nThe school will cover your fees to KMT for QTS.\r\nIf you wish to complete the PGCE there is an additional cost of £1,950 (subject to change).\r\n"}
