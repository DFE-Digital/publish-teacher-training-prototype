A short period of time will be allocated at the start of the interview to allow the candidates to ask any questions they may have in relation to the training provision offered by KMT.\r\nInterviews have a clear structure which helps keep the panel objective and focused throughout. However, this must allow flexibility and the necessary freedom for skilled interviewers to use probing, supplementary and additional questions as required to ascertain the candidate's motivation, resilience and dedication to teaching.\r\n\t\r\nAn interview format should cover:\r\n• Initial meeting between the candidate and the Course Director to discuss the training provision;\r\n• An introductory opening when the interview panel joins;\r\n• A schedule of questions which are asked by panel members;\r\n• Space for candidates to raise any issues or ask their own questions;\r\n• The close of the interview, explanation of what will happen next;\r\n• Maths and English proficiencies will be checked following an offer.\r\nIf the candidate is successful at interview, a conditional offer will be made.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will have a ‘Home’ school which is where you will spend the majority of your training year, between September and December/January, and January/February and June.
