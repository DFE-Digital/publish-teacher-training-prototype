Please be aware that the first payment is at the start of October after the course has commenced so you will need to plan  your finances accordingly. Bursaries are paid in equal instalments over 10 months, The last payment is July.\r\n\r\nThe latest information regarding bursaries for each subject is available on the government website: www.getintoteaching.education.gov.uk.","aboutCourse":"HTTP SCITT training allows teachers to have a gradual start to teaching. You will begin the course with intensive observation in your subject area and a focus on your subject curriculum, developing the necessary awareness, skills and understanding of what it means to be a great teacher of MFL.\r\n\r\nAt HTTP, we pride ourselves on the personalised support available in our programme. You will complete a Subject Knowledge Audit in our summer induction, prior to starting the course. This allows our subject leaders time to personalise the fortnightly subject development sessions based on your needs and the gaps in your foundation knowledge.\r\n\r\nIt is our aim to develop three branches in your training year: your understanding of how students' learn; your subject knowledge development and your classroom practice. You will be expected to read current generic and subject specific pedagogy so you are able to plan and sequence lessons with competence and predict sound lesson outcomes. We also encourage you to join your subject association and to network with other teachers of MFL to maximise your potential.\r\n\r\nWe will develop your skills to be a reflective practitioner and how to view your lessons through different lenses. You will be visited in your schools by your Subject Leader and your link Manager, as well as receiving weekly observations from your subject  mentor; our feedback is regular, concise and specialised to ensure you become an excellent teacher of languages.\r\n\r\nFortnightly subject leader sessions take place in our Partner schools; they provide opportunities for you to look at expert books, teaching strategies, plans and for our subject leaders to model teaching, ready for you to emulate. Subject Leaders will model the sequences and craft of language teaching that apply to French, German or Spanish. School-based subject mentors will provide weekly guidance on the intricacies and misconceptions surrounding each language.\r\n\r\nWhere possible, we will also provide opportunities for you to experience MFL teaching beyond the classroom which may involve a trip abroad! If you are a native speaker with a degree in a different subject, you will be expected to complete a SKE in advance of starting the course so an early application is advisable.\r\n\r\n We provide a PGCE for all trainees based upon 2 written modules, a viva and an eportfolio of evidence. Trainees also gain 60 level 7 credits (at M level).","interviewProcess":"The Havering Teacher Training Partnership will coordinate the recruitment process and support you to make the right decision for your training. If shortlisted, you will be invited to be interviewed by our Management team to determine whether you will make a suitable teacher. At the initial interview you will be asked to complete a short presentation. If successful, you will continue to a second interview where we ascertain your understanding of schools, the course and your suitability to teach. Following this you will be invited to meet with a subject specialist to assess your subject knowledge and whether you might benefit from a Subject Knowledge Enhancement Course should one be available in your subject.\r\n\r\nOur interview process is rigorous, fair and thorough. As the training route is challenging, we work hard to achieve the best match of applicants to the available places in schools, which is why our close relationships with our partnership schools enables us to personalise your support. \r\n\r\nWhilst we ask a lot from potential trainees; we ask more from our partner schools to support your training. Each school will provide a subject mentor and a Professional tutor, as well as a link course tutor. We also boast past trainees in all of our partner schools who can offer informal support and understanding along your journey.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"On this route, you will be placed in one of our partner schools but will also benefit from half a term's experience in a contrasting school. From the beginning, you will be treated like a member of staff and will attend staff meetings and training days. You will be in school from the first day of the school year so you will feel part of the team from the outset and we will equip you with skills in lesson planning and behaviour management, before your teaching commences.\r\n\r\nYou will be teaching pupils in both KS3 and KS4 during the year in one of our 15 partner schools.

You must be ready to accept constructive criticism to get the most from the experienced practitioners we will place you with. \r\nPassion for your subject is not optional!
