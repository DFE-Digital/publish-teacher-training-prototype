You will begin the course with intensive observation in your subject area and a focus on your subject curriculum, developing the necessary awareness, skills and understanding of what it means to be a great teacher of Physical Education. You will also complete some observation in your second subject, focusing on KS3.\r\n\r\nAt HTTP, we pride ourselves on the personalised support available in our programme. You will complete a Subject Knowledge Audit in our summer induction in PE, prior to starting the course. This allows our subject leaders time to personalise the fortnightly subject development sessions based on your needs and the gaps in your foundation knowledge. You will also be given a second audit for Biology to track your progress over the year.\r\n\r\nYou will attend fortnightly Subject Leader sessions in PE but will have access to the Science SL training session resources and any additional Subject knowledge training on offer.\r\n\r\nYour timetable will be 75-80% PE and 25-30% in Biology, with a focus on KS3. You will be able to observe KS4 Biology in the year as well. You will teach approximately one science class per term, starting with Year 7 and building up to include an additional year group later in the year when your teaching hours increase.\r\n\r\nThe PE curriculum has a range of health and safety requirements. We aim to expose you to develop as many skills as possible and as part of your fees, we will pay towards one additional external qualification, such as Level 1 and 2 Trampolining, to help close your gaps and ensure you are highly employable.\r\n\r\nWe provide a PGCE for all trainees based upon 2 written modules, a viva and an eportfolio of evidence. Trainees also gain 60 level 7 credits (at M level).","interviewProcess":"The Havering Teacher Training Partnership will coordinate the recruitment process and support you to make the right decision for your training. If shortlisted, you will be invited to be interviewed by our Management team to determine whether you will make a suitable teacher. At the initial interview you will be asked to complete a short presentation. If successful, you will continue to a second interview where we ascertain your understanding of schools, the course and your suitability to teach. Following this you will be invited to meet with a subject specialist to assess your subject knowledge and whether you might benefit from a Subject Knowledge Enhancement Course should one be available in your subject.\r\n\r\nOur interview process is rigorous, fair and thorough. As the training route is challenging, we work hard to achieve the best match of applicants to the available places in schools, which is why our close relationships with our partnership schools enables us to personalise your support. \r\n\r\nWhilst we ask a lot from potential trainees; we ask more from our partner schools to support your training. Each school will provide a subject mentor and a Professional tutor, as well as a link course tutor. We also boast past trainees in all of our partner schools who can offer informal support and understanding along your journey.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"On this route, you will be placed in one of our partner schools but will also benefit from half a term's experience in a contrasting school. From the beginning, you will be treated like a member of staff and will attend staff meetings and training days. You will be in school from the first day of the school year so you will feel part of the team from the outset and we will equip you with skills in lesson planning and behaviour management, before your teaching commences.\r\n\r\nYou will be teaching pupils in both KS3 and KS4 during the year in one of our 15 partner schools. The Partnership is an accredited ITT provider currently working with the following schools: Abbs Cross Academy, Bower Park Academy, The Brittons Academy, Harris Rainham, The Coopers Company and Coborn School, Campion School, The Drapers' Academy, Emerson Park Academy, The Frances Bardsley Academy, Hall Mead School, Hornchurch High School, Marshalls Park Academy, Redden Court School, Royal Liberty School, The Sacred Heart of Mary Girls' School and The Sanders School. \r\n\r\nThe long established nature of the Partnership ensures you will be placed in a school and a department where HTTP can be confident you will thrive.","personalQualities":"We are looking for the right blend of subject expertise and people skills to be able to impact upon the development of our young people. \r\nWe will expect you to speak clearly and coherently, and be comfortable talking to adults and students in a range of situations. You must be ready to accept constructive criticism to get the most from the experienced practitioners we will place you with. \r\nPassion for your subject is not optional! We will embrace your passion, drive and energy to support you to grow your teacher identity and become an effective practitioner.\r\n","otherRequirements":"You will have spent some time in an all-ability state school secondary school observing or possibly in paid employment. Alternatively you may have worked with teenagers in a voluntary capacity. We understand that early applicants may still be in the process of finding a school to visit or looking to gain experience if at all possible - we may be able to help with this if short-listed for interview.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:54:35.283Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-22T13:40:01.486Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"}
