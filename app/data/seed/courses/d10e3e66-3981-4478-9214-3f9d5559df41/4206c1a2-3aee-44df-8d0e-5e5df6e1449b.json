We have a reputation for being amongst the best school-led teacher training providers in the country (Good Teacher Training Guide 2015 and 2017).\r\n\r\nOur School Direct Primary General with Mathematics Salaried programme is an employment based programme that leads to the award of QTS (Qualified Teacher Status).  A grant is provided by the government to subsidise an unqualified teachers' salary and to cover training costs.  Trainees are employed by a host school and will have the opportunity for a six week experience in a contrasting school and enhancement opportunities within the partnership of schools.   SSF will provide additional training for the required mathematical subject knowledge, research and pedagogy through Surrey Maths Hub, together with an opportunity to see high quality mathematic teaching in practice.\r\n\r\nTrainees are in school for four days each week and this includes some school based training time to observe experienced colleagues or undertake course requirements.  Teaching commitments gradually increase, working up to three to four days a week by July 2022.  One day each week is spent off site with your local cohort at professional studies training.\r\n\r\nSSF provides a diverse and engaging programme of weekly [professional studies training](http://www.ssfscitt.org.uk/page/?title=Weekly+Professional+Studies&pid=16), covering the range of primary curriculum subjects, SEND, behaviour management, EAL and others. Training is led by a team of local and national experts and outstanding primary practitioners. Each year the training has a 100% good or very good rating, but is constantly reviewed and updated to keep pace with the changing primary school landscape and national priorities.\r\n\r\nWe recognise that location is an important factor for you so we run training in geographical cohorts and build local support networks (2021 hubs are Farnham, Reigate, Epsom and Cobham).  \r\n\r\nConsideration of trainee workload underpins programme design and structure.  Personalised training plans ensure a steady pace and deadlines are carefully scheduled and do not overlap. Every trainee is allocated a school mentor and external support tutor to ensure that training is tailored to individual needs.\r\n\r\nAssessment is continuous and will include observations of your teaching, school based tasks and the ability to articulate your practice. ","interviewProcess":"Once we have received your application through UCAS or DfE Apply we will check that you meet eligibility criteria.  Your personal statement will be read by the Director of ITT (who contributes to UCAS advice for applicants in the UCAS blog section on their website).\r\n\r\nWe will shortlist and invite successful applicants for an interview (we hold interview each week).  These will be held virtually via Zoom or at the lead school, South Farnham School (GU9 8DY) as and when COVID19 guidance permits.  It is important to note that partnership schools are located across the county and within bordering areas.  You would be placed into a local school.  Weekly professional studies training takes place at venues across Surrey to ensure ease of travel and to create local support networks for our trainees.\r\n\r\nThe interview will consist of:\r\n\r\n* a panel interview with a partnership school Head teacher and a member of the SSF SCITT team\r\n* a short presentation (five minutes) on your commitment and ability to become an outstanding primary school teacher\r\n* core subject tests to assess your competency in Mathematics and English (these give us a greater insight into your training needs and enable us to offer subject knowledge enhancement)\r\n* an opportunity to ask questions and explore your personal training needs, placement school and programme options\r\n\r\nIf successful we will make you an offer through UCAS or DfE Apply.  Conditions will include qualification and DBS checks.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"As a primary provider our programmes cover the 3 - 11 age phase and you can select either our 3 - 9 age range programme (covering early years, key stage one and lower key stage two with additional training in EYFS) or our 5 - 11 age range programme (covering key stages one and two).\r\n\r\nTrainees are based in various schools across Surrey and the surrounding areas and new schools join us each year. We make every effort to place trainees based upon where they live, accessibility and to ensure that the placement is appropriate to their needs. Please [click here](http://www.ssfscitt.org.uk/page/?title=Where+we+Train&pid=10) to view an interactive map of our current partnership schools.  \r\n\r\nA benefit of our programme is that you will know which partner school you are to be placed in before attending a welcome meeting in late June/early July with your school based mentor. This gives our trainees the advantage of being able to make links with their new school team before the programme starts.\r\n\r\nThe majority of successful applications are supported by a school and existing relationships are in place.  Whilst this is not a requirement of our selection procedures we would strongly advise candidates to seek potential links with local schools.\r\n\r\nThere are opportunities to experience two schools, visit a special educational needs school and to look at secondary, early years and EAL provision (pupils with English as an additional language)\r\n\r\nWe always welcome the opportunity to speak to head-teachers and senior leaders about becoming involved, particularly where a potential candidate is being supported by a school not currently in the partnership.","personalQualities":"We are looking for people with the desire and passion to challenge and inspire children.
