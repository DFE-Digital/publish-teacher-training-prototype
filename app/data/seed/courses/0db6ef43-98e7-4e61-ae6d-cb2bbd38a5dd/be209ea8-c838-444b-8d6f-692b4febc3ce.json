These may be exhibited as behavioural, emotional and social difficulties; speech, language and communications needs; hearing, visual or multi-sensory impairment; physical disabilities and autistic spectrum disorders. \r\n\r\nOur course will be of particular interest to graduate staff working within special needs schools who are seeking a progression route to become fully qualified teachers.\r\n\r\nWe create opportunities for students to immerse themselves fully in school life to provide a comprehensive experience of working with these special children. Trainees complete two full time placements over the course of the academic year. The majority of the time is spent in the special needs school to which the application has been made, with one placement in a mainstream primary school. \r\n\r\nThe placements will provide trainee teachers with experience of working with children at key stages one and two. There will be a specific number of assessed weeks within each placement and throughout the training students will receive mentoring support to help them develop the attributes required to demonstrate Teaching Standards for QTS. \r\n\r\nAll trainees will attend their school placements on Monday to Thursday throughout the school year and will attend training sessions provided by Northumbria University and Sunningdale Teaching School on Fridays. \r\n\r\nThe training delivered by Sunningdale will provide equip students for teaching in mainstream primary schools but will also provide a deep understanding of strategies to support the learning of children with special needs that many mainstream training providers are unlikely to make available within their training programmes. \r\n\r\nWith the support of the partner school mentors, trainees will be responsible for collating a portfolio of evidence which demonstrates their capacities to teach against the Teachers’ Standards for QTS.
