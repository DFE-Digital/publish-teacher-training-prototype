These may be exhibited as behavioural, emotional and social difficulties; speech, language and communications needs; hearing, visual or multi-sensory impairment; physical disabilities and autistic spectrum disorders. \r\n\r\nOur course will be of particular interest to graduate staff working within special needs schools who are seeking a progression route to become fully qualified teachers.\r\n\r\nWe create opportunities for students to immerse themselves fully in school life to provide a comprehensive experience of working with these special children. Trainees complete two full time placements over the course of the academic year. The majority of the time is spent in the special needs school to which the application has been made, with one placement in a mainstream primary school. \r\n\r\nThe placements will provide trainee teachers with experience of working with children at key stages one and two.
