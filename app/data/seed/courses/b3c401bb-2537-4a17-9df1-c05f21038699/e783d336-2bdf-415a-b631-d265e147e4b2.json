The programme is carefully designed in conjunction with Bath Spa University to support you to work with the 11-16 age range, and offering, where possible, the experience of A Level teaching.\r\n\r\nOur students have placements in two secondary schools during the year. In each placement school you will be supported by our Lead Trainer and a subject mentor, as well as a university-based tutor. During your placements you will continue to be supported by our Lead Trainer, and will spend one afternoon each week at St John's Marlborough for CCS, in addition to your scheduled CCS days throughout the year. This gives you the chance to share good practice and discuss your experiences and current issues with us, and with other School Direct trainees. You will also spend two blocks of time with Bath Spa University, in September/October and again in January/February.\r\n\r\nWe are proud of our School Direct training programme and offer a range of benefits including:\r\n\r\n* A bespoke CCS programme exploring current teaching issues including Wellbeing, EAL, SEND, Mental Health, Recovery Curriculum, and supporting disadvantaged/disengaged students.\r\n* Weekly meetings with other trainees and your Lead Trainer(LT), focusing on key topics\r\n* The benefit of the expertise of our LT as well as a University Subject Tutor\r\n* An excellent training base, situated at St John’s Marlborough, and access to our staff CPD programmes with keynote speakers, subject training and presentations on hot topics.\r\n* Highly experienced and friendly subject mentors\r\n* A ready-made, friendly support group with other Excalibur trainees, with an opportunity to meet the group at an induction event prior to starting the course in September\r\n* Confidence that we will work hard to match you to placement schools that will be convenient for you and your family commitments\r\n* Knowing where your placement schools will be before the course starts\r\n* Excellent prospects: we work hard to ensure your training year makes you stand out at interview.\r\n\r\nWe receive extremely positive feedback from our students. Comments have included:-\r\n\r\n* \"The support network is great and I know I will always have someone I can approach if I need help\"\r\n* \"The information we have been given is very well structured\"\r\n* \"My questions and concerns were answered before I had even thought to ask\"","interviewProcess":"We carefully consider all the applications we receive, in conjunction with the Admissions team at Bath Spa University. \r\n\r\nIf you are invited to interview we will notify you by email and on Apply/UCAS. You will normally need to allow up to 3 hours, usually at St John's Marlborough, for your interview.\r\n\r\nThe interview process includes a short observed teaching task with a group of students, usually from Year 7 or 8 (or a remote alternative if necessary), a written task, and a formal panel interview. You will be provided with the content of the teaching task, and the age group you will be asked to teach, in advance, as well as any other relevant information to enable you to demonstrate your skills and qualities.\r\n\r\nYou will need to bring your original examination certificates with you to be checked, as well as some personal identification. This would be checked and passed to Bath Spa University only if we intend to offer you a place on the course.\r\n\r\nFollowing your interview we will aim to notify you of the outcome on UCAS within 2 working days.\r\n\r\nOffers may be conditional on completing your degree or other qualifications, or on completing a Subject Knowledge Enhancement course.\r\n\r\nIf you are offered a place on our course and choose to accept it, we will then contact you with further information about the course.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We aim to match placements to our students' individual needs wherever we can. Often a number of our students will have family or childcare commitments and we aim to place them in schools that mean travelling time will be kept to a minimum.\r\n\r\nYou will have two placements. The longest, your Home Placement, will usually be at St John's Marlborough, Wiltshire, or at John O’Gaunt School in Hungerford, West Berkshire. The shorter, Complementary Placement, may be at another one of our partner schools in the area. In each school you will have a designated subject mentor who has experience of initial teacher training (ITT) and you will be in regular contact with Excalibur Teaching School, through weekly Core Curriculum Studies sessions at St John’s Marlborough.\r\n\r\nDuring your placements you will spend most of your time in the classroom. You will watch experienced teachers in action, and learn to teach classes from initially taking the register, completing a short section of the lesson and gradually moving on to taking the whole class for full blocks of lessons. You will also have the opportunity to experience wider school life in your placement schools, and you will have an experienced personal mentor to guide you.\r\n\r\nThe weekly Core Curriculum sessions at St John's take place one afternoon each week while you are on placement, and gives you the opportunity to come together with other Excalibur trainees and with our Lead Trainer to share good practice and discuss your experiences.\r\n","personalQualities":"Our aim is to train you to embrace the professional qualities and attributes necessary to be an outstanding teacher, and to maximise the outcomes of the children and young people you teach.\r\n\r\nBecoming a teacher is very much about being a team member and this will be reflected over the tenure of your programme. You will need to work effectively on joint projects, work collaboratively as a member of a team, and going forward in your career, accept leadership roles. You will need excellent communication skills and the ability to remain professional at all times, without exception. ","otherRequirements":"Successful applicants:\r\n* may receive offers conditional on completing a Subject Knowledge Enhancement course (where your degree does not closely match your chosen subject, or where there is a significant gap between completing your degree and commencing the PGCE).\r\n* will be required to complete a Health Questionnaire, ensuring trainees have the health and physical capacity to teach and will not put children and young people at risk of harm. \r\n* will be subject to Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) barred list and criminal records check. \r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:50:15.033Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-04T10:21:50.239Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2024"}
