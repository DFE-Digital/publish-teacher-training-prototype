It feeds their natural curiosity and supports them in developing a sense of space and place. As such, humanities teachers are in great demand and this course appeals to graduates who are passionate about geography but want to develop the skills and understanding to teach outside their specialism.\r\n\r\nThrough this PGCE, you will gain the understanding and skills necessary to operate as a critically reflective Geography with humanities teacher in a secondary school setting. You will also develop the awareness and ability to transfer these skills and teach in subject areas across the humanities spectrum (such as history, government and politics, citizenship or religious education).\r\n\r\nAs a school-led route the great majority of your time will be spent in your training school, and the content and focus of many aspects of the training programme will be targeted to meet your individual needs, by utilising the resources of the school and their alliance partners. In addition, at Middlesex you will also benefit from access to the University's extensive resources, including those provided by the library and student support services.\r\n\r\nStudents will study for the PGCE. The Middlesex School Direct programme provides you with a series of subject enhancement sessions, and a programme of professional studies which will be run at the University. These may include sessions which:\r\n\r\n*Allow you to visit a variety of partnership schools and non-formal educational sites to enhance learning in specialist areas.\r\n\r\n*Provide you with opportunities to enhance your knowledge and pedagogy of your subject, or specialist areas of the curriculum.\r\n\r\n*Develop your understanding of key contemporary issues within education, such as those around inclusion or EAL and SEND provision in schools.","interviewProcess":"You will need to attend an interview, which should take place within the school you will be training to teach.\r\n\r\nAt the interview stage, your suitability for teaching will be assessed including your subject knowledge for teaching and competency in the fundamental skills of English and Maths.
