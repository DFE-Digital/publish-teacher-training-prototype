In addition to working towards Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) on successful completion of the course, apprentices will also complete an end point assessment (EPA) after the summer to consolidate learning from initial teacher training.\r\n\r\nIt is an alternative to a traditional full-time university course, offering a postgraduate-level qualification, no tuition fees, and the opportunity to earn while you learn.\r\n\r\nPostgraduate Teaching Apprenticeships are available for prospective primary school teachers in England.\r\nYou’ll be employed by the school while you learn on the job. \r\nIf you’re currently working as an unqualified teacher or teaching assistant, it offers new opportunities for career progression, plus higher earning capacity, recognition, and status.\r\nYou’ll receive a combination of classroom teaching and off-the-job training as you to work towards Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).\r\nSimilar to School Direct (salaried) programmes, you’ll be employed directly by the school. Unlike School Direct (salaried) programmes:\r\n\r\nPostgraduate Teaching Apprenticeship programmes combine paid work with on and off-the-job training. The design of the programme has been led by a group of experienced schools and teachers, specifically for apprentices. Apprentices will split their time between school and study. You’ll receive practical, school-led training alongside experienced staff, and spend at least 20% of your time off-timetable to learn the pedagogy of teaching in addition to working towards QTS on successful completion of the course, apprentices will also complete an end point assessment (EPA) after the summer to consolidate learning from initial teacher training.","interviewProcess":"Only successful applicants will be shortlisted for interview.
