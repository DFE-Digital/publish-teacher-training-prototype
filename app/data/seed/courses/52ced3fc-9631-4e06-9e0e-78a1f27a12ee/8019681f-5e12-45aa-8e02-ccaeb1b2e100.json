They will also be required to complete a Record of Professional Development to evidence meeting standards. \r\nPlacement one starts in Oct and finishes in Dec  with preparation days the week before the placement commences.  During placement 1 the trainee teachers should teach 50% of a full timetable - this could be whole class, groups and 1:1.  They should also be team teaching and planning, leading group work and assessing pupil progress. They will also need to observe practice in the Foundation stage, Key Stage one and Two  which should include observing and teaching phonics. \r\n\r\nDuring January and February the students will have enhancement opportunities they will have the opportunity to spend 2 weeks in an alternative setting eg , special school,  undertake immersion days across a variety of settings eg : school with a lot of EAL pupils. They will also undertake one week in a Nursery or Secondary school . \r\n\r\nPlacement Two commences in March again with preparation days and finishes at the end of June. Trainee teachers will build up to teaching 70 % of a full timetable as  well as all the other experiences as in Placement one. \r\n\r\nThe Telford Partnership works very closely with Wolverhampton University and all schools work closely together to ensure trainee teachers are well supported and they get the most out of their training. All schools in the Partnership have a lead teacher and mentors again who work closely together across the partnership. We meet regularly to look at what we can offer trainees and also give trainees some say in which schools they may like to train with, this is for Primary PGCE, Secondary placements are subject specific. ","interviewProcess":"All trainee teachers, as part of our selection procedures, will take part in a rigorous selection process designed to assess their suitability to teach. This includes an interview, audit of subject knowledge, Fitness to teach and enhanced DBS checks.\r\n\r\nAs part of the Primary selection process within the Telford Partnership we ask our candidates to choose a Year group to read/ share a story with  and then we go on a short learning walk across the school, this is followed by  a short session looking at qualifications and fitness to teach with our link University tutor and this is followed by a joint interview with Partnership staff and the University tutor. \r\n\r\nAll Primary selection sessions take place in a primary school setting. \r\n\r\nSecondary selection involves a similar process and is run by each Secondary school and link subject tutors from Wolverhampton University.  ","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"See section about the course for some information. \r\n\r\nThe Telford Partnership has 5 Primary schools and 3 Secondary schools. We take 5 Primary students each year as a minimum so we place one student in each primary school for each placement. Secondary schools take students in subject areas (see UCAS offer). \r\n\r\nSchools are all in Telford and no further than 10 minutes from the Town Centre road, train and bus routes are good. \r\n\r\n Students once through the selection process have the opportunity to visit all schools in the partnership and talk to staff and then can ask for a specific Primary school if they feel this is a fit for them. We try hard to work with students to accommodate preferences if they have any. Again Secondary placements are subject specific.\r\n\r\nWe also offer regular catch up meetings for students to get together at one school  with Lead teachers, University tutors  and mentors before the placements begin and during placements. We feel this is very important part of our Partnership offer. ","personalQualities":"We are looking for applicants with a real passion for teaching. We are looking to recruit people who we believe can make a real difference to children's learning. We are looking for candidates that will fit naturally into our Partnership schools.
