Evidence will include observations of Trainee teaching and written assignments, which should demonstrate a clear understanding of professional practice, phase and subject area. The expectation of time spent leading a class will increase in each successive term of the programme as Trainees develop in their skills and confidence, leading up to 80%.","interviewProcess":"Shortlisted applicants will be invited to attend an interview. \r\n\r\nIn response to guidelines schools are currently operating within due do Coronavirus (COVID-19), interviews may be conducted online.\r\n\r\n As part of this interview you will:\r\n- deliver a presentation on a topic which you will be notified of and have opportunity to prepare for in advance\r\n- have a formal interview with a panel of interviewers\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Trainees will be offered placements in one of our placement schools as part of their training programme.
