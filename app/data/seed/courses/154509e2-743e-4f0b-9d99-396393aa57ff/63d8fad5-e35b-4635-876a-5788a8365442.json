Many of the partnership schools involved in the delivery of your course are located in and around Leeds to ensure your travelling is limited and you will have the maximum time to prepare your lessons.\r\n\r\nAs part of your training, you will complete three teaching placements in the Early Years Foundation Stage and Key Stage 1, developing your teaching skills across different age ranges and helping to prepare you for future employment. Throughout these placements you will gain the specialist knowledge and teaching skills required to meet the needs of pupils in the three to seven age range.","otherRequirements":"Evidence of experience working with children of different ages within the 3-7 age-range.
