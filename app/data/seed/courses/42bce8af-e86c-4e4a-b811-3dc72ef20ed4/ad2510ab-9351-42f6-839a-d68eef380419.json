There are 10 schools in the Multi Academy Trust across London and Hertfordshire and are all committed to the same vision which is guided by our motto: ‘libertas per cultum’, (Freedom Through Education) offering a traditional education that is knowledge-rich and furnishes children with the freedom to choose a path in life that they value. At Future Teacher Training we have an unrelenting focus on producing trainee teachers of the highest calibre, characterised by their deep subject knowledge and desire to become expert teachers and leaders who level the playing field for their students, giving them the same opportunities as their more advantaged peers. \r\nOur Initial Teacher Training curriculum is unique and the central focus of our teacher training programme, designed intentionally and sequenced iteratively, building upon what we know about cognitive science and the road to becoming an expert teacher. We delivery weekly training sessions where we aim to disseminate a research-informed aspect of training that links to our curriculum strands. Our training is rooted in exploitation of examples, and often, non-examples to exemplify how this aspect of training can be applied to your teaching practice most impactfully. Along the way, we endeavour to bust lingering educational myths and ensure our trainees have access to exemplar curriculum resources. We combine these sessions with practice-based, often subject-specific training to empower trainees with opportunities to apply the pedagogical principles to their own subject and classroom with the oversight of subject experts who can model best practice, support with the application of training and give feedback as well as to work collaboratively with your subject/phase peers. It is our philosophy that trainees should be given regular opportunities to practice in advance of a lesson and receive clear, specific, actionable feedback. \r\nYou will train for one year and gain Qualified Teacher Status and the Post Graduate Certificate Education from Sussex University. \r\nYou will have a subject-specialist mentor in your school to guide and support you with your subject knowledge development and application of educational research in the classroom. \r\nFor more information: https://www.scitt.futureacademies.org/page/?title=Routes+On+offer&pid=14","interviewProcess":"There are 2 parts to our interview process.\r\n\r\n1. Pre-interview Tasks \r\nYou will be required to complete a lesson planning task based on a set learning objective relevant to your subject or phase. You will also compose a short essay on what makes great teaching. Both tasks must be completed before the interview. \r\n2. Online Interview\r\nInterviews will be conducted online, last about 45 minutes and will usually be conducted by two members of the Future Teacher Training team. We will ask a series of questions about why you have chosen teaching as a career, why you have chosen our route and us as a provider. There will also be the opportunity to ask us any questions.\r\nSubject-Knowledge Task \r\nAfter the interview you will need to complete a subject-knowledge task. This is usually a past GCSE paper, for which no preparation is required. \r\nYou will be informed within 48 hours if you have been successful. \r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We run a compulsory induction programme for two weeks in July before the start of your placement to fully prepare you to teach from the start of the programme.\r\n\r\nYou will begin your placement at the start of the September term where you will become fully immersed in the school community. You will remain in this placement school for most of your training year as we believe this is the most effective way to experience all aspects of school life. To supplement this, you will also participate in focused placements, conducting a three-week placement in the spring term, which will offer you a contrasting experience within our network of excellent schools. This network includes many independent, grammar and specialist schools. \r\n\r\nAs part of your ongoing development, you will be released by your placement school for one afternoon per week to attend centralised training: Professional Studies. This weekly programme runs throughout the whole year.","personalQualities":"We also assess applicants against the following qualities in their preliminary applications and interviews: \r\n•\tA strong academic record and passion for your subject \r\n•\tEffective communication and leadership skills.\r\n•\tThe enthusiasm required to work with the children\r\n•\tApplicants also need experience gained from working in the classroom.\r\n","otherRequirements":"In addition to the required qualifications above, before the start of the course, you will need to:\r\n•\tProvide proof of all qualifications\r\n•\tComplete an Enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service check  \r\n•\tUndergo an occupational health assessment to assess fitness for teaching.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-12-14T10:34:56.007Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-14T10:41:50.508Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"}
