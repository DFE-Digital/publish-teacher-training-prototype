There are 10 schools in the Multi Academy Trust across London and Hertfordshire and are all committed to the same vision which is guided by our motto: ‘libertas per cultum’, (Freedom Through Education) offering a traditional education that is knowledge-rich and furnishes children with the freedom to choose a path in life that they value. At Future Teacher Training we have an unrelenting focus on producing trainee teachers of the highest calibre, characterised by their deep subject knowledge and desire to become expert teachers and leaders who level the playing field for their students, giving them the same opportunities as their more advantaged peers. \r\nOur Initial Teacher Training curriculum is unique and the central focus of our teacher training programme, designed intentionally and sequenced iteratively, building upon what we know about cognitive science and the road to becoming an expert teacher. We delivery weekly training sessions where we aim to disseminate a research-informed aspect of training that links to our curriculum strands. Our training is rooted in exploitation of examples, and often, non-examples to exemplify how this aspect of training can be applied to your teaching practice most impactfully. Along the way, we endeavour to bust lingering educational myths and ensure our trainees have access to exemplar curriculum resources. We combine these sessions with practice-based, often subject-specific training to empower trainees with opportunities to apply the pedagogical principles to their own subject and classroom with the oversight of subject experts who can model best practice, support with the application of training and give feedback as well as to work collaboratively with your subject/phase peers. It is our philosophy that trainees should be given regular opportunities to practice in advance of a lesson and receive clear, specific, actionable feedback. \r\nYou will train for one year and gain Qualified Teacher Status and the Post Graduate Certificate Education from Sussex University. \r\nYou will have a subject-specialist mentor in your school to guide and support you with your subject knowledge development and application of educational research in the classroom. \r\nFor more information: Future Teacher Training - Routes On offer (futureacademies.org)\r\n","interviewProcess":"There are 2 stages to our interview process.\r\nStage 1\r\nPre-interview Tasks \r\nYou will be required to complete a lesson planning task based on a set learning objective relevant to your subject or phase.
