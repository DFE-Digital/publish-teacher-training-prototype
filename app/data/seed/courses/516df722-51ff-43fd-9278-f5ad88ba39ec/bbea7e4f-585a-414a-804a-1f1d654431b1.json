In order to achieve QTS, you will be assessed against all parts of the Teachers’ Standards as you accumulate the evidence across the ten month training programme. Additionally, to gain your PGCE there are three Masters’ level assignments to write during your training and they help to link theory to the practice of what you are teaching in the classroom.\r\nIn collaboration with our partnership schools, development of a trainee’s subject knowledge is a key feature of our programme and we create many opportunities for trainees to develop their subject knowledge. Not only from your school based mentors but also from our subject knowledge trainers who are all practising teachers and share their extensive knowledge and expertise about how to teach their subject to secondary students.\r\nCentre based training takes place in venues in either Norwich or Ipswich (whichever is closest to you) and this is approximately in six one week blocks throughout the year and in addition there are at least six subject knowledge days to attend which are mainly delivered in partnership schools across the two counties. All this information about venues and dates of training for the whole year will be provided to you at induction at the end of August so you can make the appropriate travel arrangements.\r\nCentre based training is delivered by a range of classroom practitioners and experts in specific areas e.g. SEND, headteachers and local and national consultants. On this route, you will be in school two days a week in Year 1 in your main placement school during term time. You will start Year 2 in your second placement school on three days a week and then return in January of Year 2 to your main placement school for three days a week. This placement structure provides you with a breadth of experiences to help inform your choice of the type of school you wish to work in as an Early Career Teacher.\r\nAs part of our offer, we will also provide you with a laptop to use while on programme and as an investment in your training, we will provide you with your own copies of a number of books by educationalists such as Tom Sherrington which will help to understand the evidence based approach to teaching and learning.","interviewProcess":"After your application is shortlisted by a team of subject specialists, you will be invited to a formal interview.
