The university works with us to provide quality input on how to teach and assess in secondary Biology and also provides a comprehensive programme of professional studies which complements the sessions offered across our partnership. \r\n\r\nUniversity sessions take place at various times throughout the course on the University campus and include a mix of lectures, workshops and tutorials led by faculty colleagues, outstanding practitioners from partnership schools as well as other educational experts. These sessions also allow you to share your experiences with other trainee teachers and reflect on the learning and teaching you do in schools.\r\n\r\nAll School Direct students are assessed formatively through the course and summatively against the Teachers' Standards in order to be recommended for the award of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). The University of Brighton works in partnership with schools to organise a final assessment and make a recommendation for QTS. A university tutor will be assigned to support you whilst you are on the programme and you will be eligible to access a range of support services provided by the University.\r\n\r\nStudents on the School Direct Training route are automatically registered on the Brighton PGCE and will be required to submit academic assignments, some at Masters Level, during the course. This facilitates progression to an MA Education award after completion of the PGCE.\r\n\r\nFor further information on the course can be found [here](https://www.brighton.ac.uk/courses/study/school-direct-tuition-and-school-direct-salaried.aspx).\r\n","interviewProcess":"If we are interested in pursuing your application we will pass your details to the University of Brighton and you will be interviewed by the University in the first instance before being interviewed by the partnership. \r\n\r\nHeathfield Community College is the lead school in the partnership and will be co-ordinating the interview process. Interviews may take place online or face-to-face. This will involve approximately 2-3 hours spent at one of the partnership schools and will include the delivery of a presentation about a teaching activity you have previously undertaken, a short written task related to a current educational issue and the opportunity to talk to some staff and pupils as well as the formal interview. \r\n\r\nSubject staff and at least one Professional Tutor will be involved in the interviews.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will complete your first teaching placement in one of our schools, a short second placement in a different partnership school and then you will return to your first placement school for the remainder of your school-based training. Placement start and end dates are the same as for the PGCE courses run by the university. \r\n\r\nAll four schools are able to provide access to post-16 learners and the opportunity to experience 6th form teaching in a successful and supportive environment.\r\n\r\nWe are keen to ensure that placement schools work for both the trainee and schools. Therefore we are happy to discuss placement school preferences during the interview process.\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for well-qualified, committed and enthusiastic trainee teachers who are passionate about Biology and keen to share this passion with young people of all abilities in the secondary age range.\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"We would expect you to have some experience of working with young people in this age group, possibly in a sports club or similar. \r\n\r\nIt is an advantage to have done some recent classroom observation in your subject area before you come to interview.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:50:48.028Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-24T12:30:06.146Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2023"}
