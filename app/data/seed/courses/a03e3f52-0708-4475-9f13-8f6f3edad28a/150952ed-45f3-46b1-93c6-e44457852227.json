It has been designed to give Trainee Teachers the necessary learning opportunities and support to enable them to demonstrate they have developed the knowledge, skills and behaviours to meet the Teachers’ Standards for QTS. There are built-in assessment structures which help Trainees track their progression throughout the Colchester Teacher Training Consortium CTTC curriculum. This curriculum is centred around 4 key values: CREATIVITY, TARGETED INTERVENTION, THINKING CRITICALLY AND COLLABORATION and ensures trainees have full access to their entitlement under the Initial Teacher Training Core Content Framework.\r\n\r\nThe training consists of placements within two contrasting schools across the secondary age phase, along with centre-based training and engagement with evidence based academic research. There is also the opportunity to gain experience within SEND, EAL, Sixth form and Pupil Referral Unit settings.

This also gives the opportunity for applicants to demonstrate they can communicate in writing, accurately and effectively.\r\n\r\nThe interview will last for approximately 25 minutes and includes a 10 minute presentation on the lesson discussing the reasoning behind the candidates lesson design.  Questions will be framed around the applicant’s previous relevant experience, skills, knowledge of the curriculum and aptitude for becoming a teacher of the future.
