It has been designed to give Trainee Teachers the necessary learning opportunities and support to enable them to demonstrate they have developed the knowledge, skills and behaviours to meet the Teachers' Standards for QTS.  There are built-in assessment structures which help Trainees track their progression throughout the CTTC curriculum.  This curriculum is centred around 4 key values: CREATIVITY, TARGETED INTERVENTION, THINKING CRITICALLY AND COLLABORATION and ensures trainees have full access to their entitlement under the Initial Teacher Training Core Content Framework. \r\n\r\nThe training consists of placements within two schools across opposite key stages, along with centre-based training sessions.  There is also the opportunity to gain experience within SEND, secondary and nursery settings.
