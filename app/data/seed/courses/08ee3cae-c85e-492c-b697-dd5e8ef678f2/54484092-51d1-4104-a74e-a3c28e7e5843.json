Wood Green ITT Allianceâ€™s School Direct trainees are tuition fee paying trainees (fees payable to the UoB) who will receive very similar training and the same qualifications as core University of Birmingham PGDipEd trainees.\r\nThe benefit of our School Direct route is that it allows aspiring trainee teachers to apply directly for their preferred training schools; for this particular course the schools are Wood Green Academy and Queen Mary's Grammar School. \r\nThis year long, full-time course will train you to teach secondary school pupils aged 11-18. (120 days in school; 50 days approx at university)\r\nThe course is split into two placement phases. Placement 1 - 9 weeks and placement 2 - 16 weeks with an extra 2 weeks of school experience at the very start of the course. \r\nYou will be trained as a subject specialist in your chosen curriculum area; our programme will focus on the five ITT Core Content Framework competency areas of Behaviour Management, Pedagogy, Curriculum, Assessment and Professional behaviours  and will guide you to develop the knowledge and skills needed to achieve the Teachers' professional standards therefore QTS.
