Trainees will achieve QTS and be enrolled on a Masters Programme with the University of Derby for the award of PGCE. Training is majority school-based at Ipswich Academy in Suffolk with some centre-based training. Training occurs at various locations across Essex so we take into account your home address to try to keep travelling time to a minimum. You will receive training on the general aspects of successful teaching and training around teaching your specific subject.\r\n\r\nIn school you will work closely with a subject / phase specific mentor and the ITT co-ordinator, who will meet regularly with you to assist you with your training plan. You will also have an external tutor who works for Essex Teacher Training, who will visit you in school 5 times in the year to check on your progress towards meeting the Teachers' Standards.\r\n\r\nThe PGCE is delivered locally in Essex by the University of Derby and comprises 3 assignments, which are spread across the course of the year.\r\nTrainees will have access to an online e-portfolio system and online resources along with face to face training sessions. These along with the excellent support from in-school mentors and tutors from Essex Teacher Training, will mean you will feel fully prepared for working in the classroom. Your teaching load will start small and increase gradually as the year progresses. The rate at which this increases will be decided by you and your tutors and take into account any prior experience.\r\n\r\nAssessment is via observations of you teaching, reflective pieces of writing and specific tasks relating to the different Teachers' Standards.","interviewProcess":"If you are successfully shortlisted for interview, you can expect to be observed teaching a short lesson with a class so we can assess your teaching potential.\r\n\r\nIn addition, you will attend a face-to-face interview with senior members of staff.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Trainees will be based in Ipswich Academy with ages ranging from 11 - 16.\r\n\r\nTrainees will spend the majority of their time at the school in either KS3 or KS4 with some time in an alternative key stage.
