Training is a blend of face to face and online and occurs at various locations across Essex so we take into account your home address to try to keep travelling time to a minimum.  You will receive training on the general aspects of successful teaching and training around teaching your specific subject in secondary or phase within primary.\r\n\r\nIn school you will work closely with a subject / phase specific mentor and the ITT co-ordinator, who will meet regularly with you to assist you with your training plan.   You will also have an external tutor who works for Essex Teacher Training, who will visit you in school 5 times in the year to check on your progress towards meeting the Teachers' Standards.\r\n\r\nThe PGCE is delivered locally in Essex by Anglia Ruskin University and comprises 2 assignments and related tasks, which are spread across the course of the year.\r\n\r\nTrainees will have access to an online e-portfolio system and online resources along with face to face training sessions.  These along with the excellent support from in-school mentors and tutors from Essex Teacher Training, will mean you will feel fully prepared for working in the classroom.  Your teaching load will start small and increase gradually as the year progresses.  The rate at which this increases will be decided by you and your tutors and take into account any prior experience.\r\n\r\nAssessment is via observations of you teaching, reflective pieces of writing and specific tasks relating to the different Teachers' Standards.\r\n","interviewProcess":"If you are successfully shortlisted for interview, you can expect to be observed teaching a short lesson with a class so we can assess your teaching potential.\r\n\r\nIn addition, you will attend a face-to-face interview with senior members of staff.\r\n\r\nIf successful, you will be given a conditional offer of a place to train.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Trainees will be based in Ipswich Academy.\r\n\r\nThe programme covers the secondary age range 11-16 and you will be required to teach at both KS3 and KS4.
