They also follow a chosen specialism of either Biology, Chemistry or Physics to enable them to teach this to Key Stage 5 (16-18).\r\n\r\nThe chemistry course puts an emphasis on participation, planning and practical work. The course includes the management of laboratory-based lessons, techniques of assessment, work with new technology and how to organise extra curricular chemistry sessions. Workshops and lectures specific to chemistry are run by the Chemisty subject lecturer and other expert chemistry teachers from partner schools.\r\n\r\nTrainees will also learn about risk assessment, and will work in many laboratory-based practical sessions, and reflect upon and evaluate the effectiveness of widely used school science courses. As the course continues, trainees will have the opportunity to learn about the use of new technologies in education, such as blogs and wikis, and consider how to approach controversial and ethical issues with school students. \r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Interviews usually take place at the Faculty of Education and last approximately half a day. However, interviews may need to take place online when the public health situation demands it; this will most probably be the case throughout the autumn (Michaelmas) term of 2020, and possibly beyond.\r\n\r\n There are generally 4-6 candidates on each panel, with two interviewers, and the interview is a mixture of group activities/discussion and individual tasks.  There are no tests but candidates will be expected to demonstrate their subject knowledge and language capabilities both verbally and in writing.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Trainees spend at least 120 days of the course in Partnership schools, undertaking four block placements (in a minimum of three different schools), across the entire 11-18 age range.\r\n\r\nTrainees have the opportunity to work together with experienced mentors to develop their own practical teaching skills and competence. Trainees initially work together in the classroom with other trainees and their subject mentor, before gradually taking on more responsibility for planning and teaching as the year progresses, and to gain experience of many of the important tasks and responsibilities teachers take on outside the classroom, such as pastoral care and parents' evenings.\r\n\r\nIn the final placement there is also the opportunity for trainee involvement in a wider range of school activities: for instance, curriculum development and evaluation within their specialist subject(s); work experience and other activities related to careers education and economic and industrial understanding; fieldwork related to environmental education; and other similar activities which seek to extend the experience and education of pupils beyond the conventional classroom context.","personalQualities":"* A desire to teach and enthuse young people\r\n* Commitment to state education\r\n* Strong subject-based academic background\r\n* Good communication skills\r\n* Experience working with young people\r\n* Flexibility and humour\r\n* Energy, perseverance and stamina\r\n* Ability to work collaboratively\r\n* Ability to learn and act on advice\r\n","otherRequirements":"Applicants are not required to have prior school experience as long as they have relevant experience with children in other capacities.\r\n\r\nHowever, we do recommend that you spend some time in school to help you decide if teaching is right for you.  We look for evidence of commitment to, and enthusiasm for, working with children and young people. You should consider how you might demonstrate this in your personal statement and be prepared to discuss during an interview.  \r\n\r\nIf you are unable to arrange school observation in the current circumstances, please reflect very carefully on your own schooling instead.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:55:35.626Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-17T08:36:13.728Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
