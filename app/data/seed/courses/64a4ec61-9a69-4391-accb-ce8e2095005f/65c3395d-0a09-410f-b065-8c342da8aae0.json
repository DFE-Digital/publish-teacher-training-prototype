The history classroom is also a place where pupils for whom English is an additional language ought to do important work towards becoming fluent, confident speakers and writers of English.\r\n\r\nThe course teaches you how to ensure that pupils build strong knowledge and secure chronology. You will learn about how memory works and how to make pupils use their memories better. Thoroughness, clarity and impact in your oral performance will be key.\r\n\r\nYou will be in schools for most of the course. We also get you teaching whole classes straightaway. This means that you will have plenty of real experience to reflect on and talk about, and we can diagnose your strengths and weaknesses early. That way, your school-based mentor can work with you to create targets and negotiate your personalised programme to help you improve.\r\n\r\nLearning to teach all pupils really well is extremely challenging, so you will talk about your practice with other trainees, with your mentor in school, with course tutors and with other history teachers. You will learn to use supportive criticism from others. You will learn to evaluate your practice by looking at the quality of your pupilsâ€™ historical knowledge and historical thinking using different types of assessment and research.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Interviews usually take place at the Faculty of Education and last approximately half a day. However, interviews may need to take place online when the public health situation demands it; this will most probably be the case throughout the autumn (Michaelmas) term of 2020, and possibly beyond.\r\n\r\n There are generally 6-10 candidates on each panel, with two interviewers, and the interview is a mixture of group activities/discussion and individual tasks.  There are no tests but candidates will be expected to demonstrate their subject knowledge and language capabilities both verbally and in writing.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Trainees spend at least 120 days of the course in Partnership schools, undertaking four block placements (in a minimum of three different schools), across the entire 11-18 age range.\r\n\r\nTrainees have the opportunity to work together with experienced mentors to develop their own practical teaching skills and competence. Trainees initially work together in the classroom with other trainees and their subject mentor, before gradually taking on more responsibility for planning and teaching as the year progresses, and to gain experience of many of the important tasks and responsibilities teachers take on outside the classroom, such as pastoral care and parents' evenings.\r\n\r\nIn the final placement there is also the opportunity for trainee involvement in a wider range of school activities: for instance, curriculum development and evaluation within their specialist subject(s); work experience and other activities related to careers education and economic and industrial understanding; fieldwork related to environmental education; and other similar activities which seek to extend the experience and education of pupils beyond the conventional classroom context.","personalQualities":"* A desire to teach and enthuse young people\r\n* Commitment to state education\r\n* Strong subject-based academic background\r\n* Good communication skills\r\n* Experience working with young people\r\n* Flexibility and humour\r\n* Energy, perseverance and stamina\r\n* Ability to work collaboratively\r\n* Ability to learn and act on advice\r\n","otherRequirements":"Applicants are not required to have prior school experience as long as they have relevant experience with children in other capacities.\r\n\r\nHowever, we do recommend that you spend some time in school to help you decide if teaching is right for you.  We look for evidence of commitment to, and enthusiasm for, working with children and young people. You should consider how you might demonstrate this in your personal statement and be prepared to discuss during an interview.  \r\n\r\nIf you are unable to arrange school observation in the current circumstances, please reflect very carefully on your own schooling instead.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:55:35.842Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-17T09:17:58.232Z","cycle":"2023","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
