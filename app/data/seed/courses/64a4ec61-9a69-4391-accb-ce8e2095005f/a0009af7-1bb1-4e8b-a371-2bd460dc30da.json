Degree level or equivalent in the first language (for teaching to A level in schools), and an A Level or equivalent in the second language is a minimum requirement of the course. \r\n\r\nThe Faculty-based work is taught by subject lecturers, a seconded subject mentor and other languages professionals. There is a close, interdependent relationship between faculty-based and school-based learning, with trainees working alongside an experienced mentor, who provides key training opportunities and regular systematic support and feedback on classroom teaching. This structure provides the basis for progressive competence in teaching languages to A-level, and is aimed at the development, by the end of the course, of language teachers who are enthusiastic, knowledgeable, innovative and realistic. \r\n\r\nTrainees following this course are encouraged to explore a wide range of creative and systematic approaches to teaching, covering the four language skills (speaking, listening, reading and writing), as well as focusing on the role of grammar, cultural awareness and new technologies in language teaching.   The course is built upon principles of inclusion and equality of opportunity in teaching and learning for all students whatever their potential and achievements.\r\n\r\nTrainees experience a variety of teaching methods including whole class teaching, structured group work and individual or pair work. There is a strong emphasis on active learning through discussion, presentations, peer-tutoring, research, independent study and writing. Throughout the course, trainees study different methods of assessment and how they support classroom learning and teaching. In seminars and workshops, the integral relationship between educational theory and teaching methodology is explored. Trainees are encouraged to reflect critically on their experiences as learners and teachers and to begin to develop a rationale for their classroom practice.\r\n\r\nWhatever your beliefs about languages teaching, whatever your convictions about what makes a good languages teacher, this course will challenge, extend and develop your understanding of teaching foreign languages.","interviewProcess":"Interviews usually take place at the Faculty of Education and last approximately half a day. However, interviews may need to take place online when the public health situation demands it; this will most probably be the case throughout the autumn (Michaelmas) term of 2020, and possibly beyond.\r\n\r\n There are generally 4-6 candidates on each panel, with two interviewers, and the interview is a mixture of group activities/discussion and individual tasks.  There are no tests but candidates will be expected to demonstrate their subject knowledge and language capabilities both verbally and in writing.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Trainees spend at least 120 days of the course in Partnership schools, undertaking four block placements (in a minimum of three different schools), across the entire 11-18 age range.\r\n\r\nTrainees have the opportunity to work together with experienced mentors to develop their own practical teaching skills and competence. Trainees initially work together in the classroom with other trainees and their subject mentor, before gradually taking on more responsibility for planning and teaching as the year progresses, and to gain experience of many of the important tasks and responsibilities teachers take on outside the classroom, such as pastoral care and parents' evenings.\r\n\r\nIn the final placement there is also the opportunity for trainee involvement in a wider range of school activities: for instance, curriculum development and evaluation within their specialist subject(s); work experience and other activities related to careers education and economic and industrial understanding; fieldwork related to environmental education; and other similar activities which seek to extend the experience and education of pupils beyond the conventional classroom context.","personalQualities":"* A desire to teach and enthuse young people\r\n* Commitment to state education\r\n* Strong subject-based academic background\r\n* Good communication skills\r\n* Experience working with young people\r\n* Flexibility and humour\r\n* Energy, perseverance and stamina\r\n* Ability to work collaboratively\r\n* Ability to learn and act on advice\r\n","otherRequirements":"Applicants are not required to have prior school experience as long as they have relevant experience with children in other capacities.\r\n\r\nHowever, we do recommend that you spend some time in school to help you decide if teaching is right for you.  We look for evidence of commitment to, and enthusiasm for, working with children and young people. You should consider how you might demonstrate this in your personal statement and be prepared to discuss during an interview.  \r\n\r\nIf you are unable to arrange school observation in the current circumstances, please reflect very carefully on your own schooling instead.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-12T13:49:25.425Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-17T09:20:25.722Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
