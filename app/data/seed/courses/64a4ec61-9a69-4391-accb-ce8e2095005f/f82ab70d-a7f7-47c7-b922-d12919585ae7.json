Trainees are encouraged to foster their own and their students' creativity through an enthusiastic commitment to adventurousness, exploration and systematic hard work within and beyond the classroom. Trainees are also encouraged to develop an attitude of critical enquiry and see themselves as teachers who research their classrooms so that they make informed choices in all that they do. The course therefore provides a stimulating introduction to current theory and practice in the teaching of English.\r\n\r\nThe Faculty-based work is closely linked to a programme of classroom experience in local comprehensive schools, both state maintained schools and academies. In their school-based work, trainees are mentored by experienced subject teachers. Both in the Faculty and in schools, trainees are encouraged to explore a wide range of creative and systematic approaches to teaching and learning. The course covers all aspects of the National Curriculum for English including speaking and listening, reading and writing; drama; language study; literature from different historical periods, cultures and traditions; non-literary texts; media and moving image texts; the use of information and communication technology. In addition, trainees learn about teaching English within 14-19 courses, including GCSE and A level English Language, English Literature and Creative Writing. The course also addresses areas of enrichment such as extra-curricular activities, museum and gallery education and learning in out-of-school contexts such as the nearby botanic garden and other sites of local historical interest.\r\n\r\nTrainees learn a variety of teaching methods including whole class teaching, structured group work and individual or pair work. There is a strong emphasis on active learning through discussion, presentations, peer-tutoring, research, independent study and writing. Throughout the course, trainees study different methods of assessment and how they support classroom learning, lesson planning and teaching. In seminars and workshops, the integral relationship between educational theory and teaching methodology is explored. Trainees reflect critically on their experiences as learners and teachers in regular meetings with their subject mentors in schools and develop a rationale for their classroom practice.\r\n\r\nThere is an emphasis on encouraging trainees' own creativity in producing poetry, short stories, plays and videos. Twice a year, the group meets to share and perform creative pieces that trainees have either written or made themselves or produced with their students in school.","interviewProcess":"Interviews usually take place at the Faculty of Education and last approximately half a day. However, interviews may need to take place online when the public health situation demands it; this will most probably be the case throughout the autumn (Michaelmas) term of 2020, and possibly beyond.\r\n\r\n There are generally 5 candidates on each panel, with two interviewers, and the interview is a mixture of group activities/discussion and individual tasks.  There are no tests but candidates will be expected to demonstrate their subject knowledge and language capabilities both verbally and in writing.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Trainees spend at least 120 days of the course in Partnership schools, undertaking four block placements (in a minimum of three different schools), across the entire 11-18 age range.\r\n\r\nTrainees have the opportunity to work together with experienced mentors to develop their own practical teaching skills and competence. Trainees initially work together in the classroom with other trainees and their subject mentor, before gradually taking on more responsibility for planning and teaching as the year progresses, and to gain experience of many of the important tasks and responsibilities teachers take on outside the classroom, such as pastoral care and parents' evenings.\r\n\r\nIn the final placement there is also the opportunity for trainee involvement in a wider range of school activities: for instance, curriculum development and evaluation within their specialist subject(s); work experience and other activities related to careers education and economic and industrial understanding; fieldwork related to environmental education; and other similar activities which seek to extend the experience and education of pupils beyond the conventional classroom context.","personalQualities":" The English course is for people who have a strong interest in learning to teach all aspects of the subject including literature, language, literacy, media and drama.\r\n\r\n* A desire to teach and enthuse young people\r\n* Commitment to state education\r\n* Strong subject-based academic background\r\n* Good communication skills\r\n* Experience working with young people\r\n* Flexibility and humour\r\n* Energy, perseverance and stamina\r\n* Ability to work collaboratively\r\n* Ability to learn and act on advice\r\n","otherRequirements":"Applicants are not required to have prior school experience as long as they have relevant experience with children in other capacities.\r\n\r\nHowever, we do recommend that you spend some time in school to help you decide if teaching is right for you.  We look for evidence of commitment to, and enthusiasm for, working with children and young people. You should consider how you might demonstrate this in your personal statement and be prepared to discuss during an interview.  \r\n\r\nIf you are unable to arrange school observation in the current circumstances, please reflect very carefully on your own schooling instead.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:55:35.769Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-17T09:16:27.545Z","cycle":"2023","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
