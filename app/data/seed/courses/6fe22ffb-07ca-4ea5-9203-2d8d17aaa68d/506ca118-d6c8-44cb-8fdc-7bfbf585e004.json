In order for the University of Oxford to formally recognise any overseas qualification you must present a Statement of Comparability from UK NARIC. Students in this position should first complete a course application and should then contact Get Into Teaching on 0800 389 2500. As an applicant for teacher training you can then obtain the Statement of Comparability for free (this usually costs £49.50 plus VAT).\n\nOxford's PGCE Office will only need to see the Statement of Comparability should you accept any offer to study on the course, we do not need to see the document in advance of an application or interview.\n\nIf the UK NARIC Statement of Comparability concludes that your qualifications are not equivalent, then the PGCE's Course Director will review your case. If the review is unsuccessful we may ask you to complete an equivalency test. You will be free to select the provider and type of test, as long as the final result is provided by our deadlines and is a GCSE or a direct international equivalent.","courseLength":"OneYear","feesUK":9250,"aboutCourse":"In partnership with attachment schools, we aim to encourage student teachers to reflect on the nature of ML teaching; to recognise and appreciate the changing role of ML in the Secondary school curriculum, to be enthusiastic about ML as a curriculum subject; to produce language teachers who can foster effective language learning amongst pupils of all ages and abilities (11-16 years old) and  produce reflective practitioners with a firm grasp of theory and practice and thus a dynamic template for future development over the course of their future careers.
