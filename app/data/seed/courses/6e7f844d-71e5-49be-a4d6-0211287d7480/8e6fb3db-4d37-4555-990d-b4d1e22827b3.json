She explained: “The best part of the course was the school placements. These took place in a variety of different schools in different areas around the West Midlands.\r\n\r\nYou were also placed at different key stages and this really helps you to identify where you would like to specialise.”\r\n\r\nAnd another former UCB student Sofia Khan added: “The best part of the course was the quality of the placements which gave me invaluable experience, confidence and preparation for my current teaching role.”\r\n\r\nThe placements are taken in two blocks - eight weeks in the autumn term and 10 weeks in the summer term.
