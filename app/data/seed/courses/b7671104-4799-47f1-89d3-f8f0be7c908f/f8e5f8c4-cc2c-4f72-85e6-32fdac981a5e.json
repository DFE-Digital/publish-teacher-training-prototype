So much so, 100% of our combined 2017-2018 & 2018-19 graduates secured positions as Newly Qualified Teachers within our alliance schools or local partners.\r\nThe course prepares you to teach across the age ranges 4-11 and is structured around six modules - a combination of taught modules based at the University and placement modules based in schools or educational settings.\r\nYou will undertake studies in all elements of primary education; extend your knowledge of learning and teaching, of the breadth and scope of the curriculum and the professional skills associated with high-quality teaching. You will then apply these areas of understanding and skill to classroom practice throughout the year, including during two assessed placements in schools or educational settings.\r\nAt a glance, our School Direct programme includes:\r\n\r\n*\t12 core training days at the University of Winchester.\r\n*\tFull-time learning alongside our expert teachers who have a wealth      of knowledge, experience and strategies to pass on.\r\n*\tSpecialist focus training days within the Alliance. \r\n*\tA minimum of 2 placements in two different phases and schools.\r\n*\tThree University assessed assignments. \r\n*\tOn-going assessment of the quality of your teaching and learning.\r\n*      Additional learning with a Maths specialist teacher\r\n*\tA select cohort – the number of spaces available on our programme is purposefully kept low.

You need to be very clear about why you want to become a teacher, the skills involved and what you can bring to the profession. \r\n\r\nThe interview panel is made up of senior staff from partnership schools and a representative from The University of Winchester.\r\nInterviews may include:\r\n\r\n*\tA tour of the school.\r\n*\tA reading task with children.\r\n*\tA written task.\r\n*      A short mathematics activity\r\n*\tA formal interview.\r\n\r\nThe interview is also your chance to find out more about the course, the University and our alliance of schools, so if you are invited to interview please take the opportunity to visit our websites beforehand.\r\n[FTSA.org.uk](https://www.ftsa.org.uk/teacher-training)\r\n[www.Winchester.ac.uk](https://www.winchester.ac.uk/)\r\n\r\nIf you would like a tour of one of the Alton Cluster schools and a chat with a Headteacher before you apply, please do get in contact: teaching.school@bushyleaze.hants.sch.uk. \r\nIf you are located outside the UK we are able to consider Skype or telephone interviews.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Our programme includes a minimum of 2 placements in two different phases and schools.\r\nThere are 15 schools in the Alton Cluster of our alliance, enabling us to offer a wide range of teaching experiences in Good and Outstanding; rural and town; infant, junior and all-through primary schools.
