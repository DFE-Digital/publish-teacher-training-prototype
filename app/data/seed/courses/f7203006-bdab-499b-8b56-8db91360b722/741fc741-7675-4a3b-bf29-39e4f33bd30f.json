Successful completion of your PGCE course prepares you to start your first teaching post (NQT year) within a primary school setting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA significant amount of your learning and training will take place within our Alliance schools. The Course starts early September and will finish the following July. You will complete a minimum of 120 days in school. On successful completion of the course you will be awarded the PGCE Primary (with QTS). This comprises of 120 credits, 90 of which are at Masters Level. \r\n\r\nAt the GLA, we try to contrast placements  as much as possible, providing the trainee with a breadth of experience which will make them employable in the future. \r\n\r\nYou will be gradually introduced to teaching through observations, training, assessments and marked assignments. Throughout the course you will be supported by teachers, senior leaders and trained mentors.  You will be provided with the opportunity to immerse yourself fully in school life.\r\n\r\nWe believe that a GLA school direct trainee is provided with a realistic teacher training experience and we have no doubt you will build a network of contacts within the teaching profession.    Many of our former trainees have secured employment within our Alliance schools and continue to train with the GLA in their NQT year and beyond. \r\n\r\nWe are confident our GLA trainees are very well supported during their training  year.  School leaders have a firm commitment to ensuring that all of our trainees complete their studies with the essential skills and knowledge to  prepare them for a rewarding career in the teaching profession. \r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Applications are received on our behalf by the University of Huddersfield \r\n via DfE APPLY system. (Please specify on your application the age range you prefer to teach 3-7 or 5-11). \r\nWe work closely together to ensure all applicants meet the academic requirements of the course.  Shortlisted applicants  will be invited to an interview at one of the C & K schools.  You will be provided with details of the interview process once selected. Under normal circumstances,  the interviews comprise of:\r\n\r\n* An observed Mini Teach with a  small group of children \r\n\r\n* Formal Interview with Teachers & Representatives from the C & K School Direct\r\n\r\n* Literacy and Numeracy Tasks\r\n\r\n* PLEASE NOTE\r\nDue to current COVID restrictions interviews may need to be virtual via Microsoft Teams.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"As part of your course you will undertake two placements - a HOME placement which will be in a C & K school with your chosen Key stage and an ALTERNATE placement which will be in a different school and with a different Key stage. (The HOME placement is where you will spend the majority of your time.)\r\n\r\nYou will experience the wider role of a teacher in primary school. \r\nSupport will be provided by mentors in schools who will help you to develop your practice through observations, planning meetings, weekly tutorials, reports and in-depth lesson evaluations.  All mentors are experienced members of staff and receive regular specialised training from the University of Huddersfield and C & K School Direct.\r\n\r\nWherever possible we try and consider trainees preferences over schools, but this is not always possible. We do consider travelling distances, but trainees must demonstrate some flexibility over school placements.\r\n\r\nTrainees have regular opportunities to network with other trainees both in placement schools and across the Trust through training and CPD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"You must demonstrate the ability to communicate effectively, and that you have the intellectual and academic capabilities to meet the required Teachers’ Standards by the end of the programme.\r\n\r\nAll GLA primary schools have very high expectations of their Trainees.
