The course leads to Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).

Training is predominantly school based and you will spend approximately 160 days in school. Your host school, where you will spend the majority of your training will be a special school.  You will spend the equivalent of a term in a mainstream Primary school.  You will work alongside a highly skilled mentor with further support from your School ITT-coordinator and SCITT tutors.  \r\n\r\nYou will undertake a wide range of school tasks which will include significant opportunities to observe a range of teaching approaches in your host school and schools across our partnership.  You will be asked to reflect and record your learning in relation to these tasks.  These will be referred to in training discussions and feedback rather than submitted and marked in the traditional essay manner, as always our practice is based upon recent research regarding marking and feedback.  \r\n\r\nYou will work with your mentor to engage in a combination of team teaching, small group work and whole class teaching that is both unobserved and observed.  All of which are developmental and highly focussed upon the right training and advice, given at the right time.  \r\n\r\nCore provides a comprehensive introduction to the wide range of Curriculum areas and pedagogy needed to become an excellent Primary school teacher.  We ensure that this training is provided by current practitioners therefore ensuring that theory is supported by current practice. Where possible our trainers will conduct their sessions in school.  Our PE trainer will invite you into her school wearing you PE kit ready to observe and engage in training opportunities with pupils and peers.  \r\n \r\nHalf termly assessments are based upon reviewing the progress of the children you have been teaching.   This is evidenced through lesson observation and pupil’s outcomes which are used to identify your achievements and future targets. This process is based upon the current accountability systems in our partnership schools.\r\n","interviewProcess":"You will be interviewed by a group of Head teachers/senior leaders from our partnership schools.  Our interview day includes a number of tasks one of which includes visiting one of our partnership schools to work with a group of our pupils.  Outcomes of the interviews are shared with candidates on the day.  As part of the interview process you will complete a written task and maths test.  ","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We understand that the appropriate match between trainee and school mentor is crucial to a successful year. We use the information collated from application and interview process to identify your strengths, areas for development and learning style and match these to your host school and mentor.  Many of our candidates have existing experience in our partnership schools and this is taken into consideration when planning placements.  \r\n\r\nYour host Special school is the school in which you will be predominantly based and you will become part of the school community.  You will undertake a contrasting placement during the Autumn and Spring term in a maintained Primary school.  \r\n\r\nFurther enhancement visits include schools with high proportion of pupils with English as an additional language (EAL), secondary school and other special school provision in our partnership.  \r\n\r\nWe currently work with 30 schools in Hull and surrounding area.
