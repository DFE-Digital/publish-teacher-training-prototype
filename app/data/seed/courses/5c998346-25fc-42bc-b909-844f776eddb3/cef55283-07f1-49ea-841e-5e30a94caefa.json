Placement schools can be in the West Area Partnership in Luton, including: Chantry Primary Academy, Southfield Primary, Whitefield Primary Academy, Pirton Hill Primary, Ferrars Junior, Ferrars Academy, Downside Primary and Beechwood Primary.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn and spring terms you will have responsibility for a maximum of 70% whole class teaching each week, with this rising to a maximum of 80% in the latter half of the summer term.  In the second half of the spring term, you will complete a 6-week teaching practice in a second school, within a consecutive age phase.\r\n\r\nTraining time will be allocated each week.  This will include attending 23 days of centre-based training at The Shire Foundation training venue based at Hillborough Junior School.  These sessions include a focus on curriculum studies (core subject areas and the foundation subjects), alongside professional studies (planning, assessment, behaviour management, working with pupils with special educational needs and/or disabilities and working with pupils with English as an additional language).  Training activities will also take place within the employing school setting, including observations of good practice, discussions with other professionals, INSET training and opportunities to complete reading and research.\r\n\r\nYou will be allocated a school based tutor from your school, who will oversee your training and development over the course of the training year.  They will meet with you for at least an hour on a weekly basis, as well as observing your teaching, in collaboration with other members of your school staff. At the end of the training year you will be assessed against the Teachers' Standards through the submission of an evidence portfolio and a final assessment interview.\r\n\r\nShire will also nominate a Quality Assurance Tutor who will support and monitor your progress.  They will spend a day each term visiting you within your school.\r\n\r\nTrainees following this route may also opt to complete a PGCE qualification alongside QTS.  60 credits at masters level, accredited by the University of Buckingham, will be awarded on the successful completion of 3 academic assignments.  Please note that there is an additional fee for this option.","interviewProcess":"The interview process\r\nInterviews begin in early November and continue until places are filled. \r\n\r\nThere is a two stage interview process- both stages must be passed for a candidate to be able to undertake the School Direct (Salaried) route.\r\n\r\nStage 1 is conducted by a team of experienced  Shire staff and includes an assessed presentation which tests oral communication and delivery skills, and a test of fundamental English. An online assessment of your fundamental mathematics skills will take place prior to interview. During the personal interviews applicants are asked to respond to a range of set questions designed to draw on their experience, ability to articulate their thoughts, opinions and ideas about various aspects of teaching, to assess personal qualities, emotional resilience and the potential to teach. Candidates are asked similar set questions. The interviews are scored according to set criteria and candidates meeting the criteria then proceed to the second stage interview. \r\n\r\nStage 2 is based at the potential employing school. This involves an assessment of suitability to teach by an observation of the candidate teaching a lesson in the school. This is then followed by an interview by the Head Teacher and members of the school Senior Management Team. \r\n\r\nThe interviews are scored according to set criteria and candidates meeting the criteria will then be offered a place, which will be subject to meeting criteria such as DBS, fitness to teach checks and academic qualifications. \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The Shire Foundation is accredited to award QTS within the 3-11 primary range and we work with nursery, primary, middle and special schools. \r\n\r\nAs there is no longer any government funding for this route, candidates are required to already have a potential employing school in place, prior to application\r\n\r\nWe endeavour to organise second school placements within the partnership.  This will be within a contrasting school and a different age phase.","personalQualities":"Command of the English language\r\nTrainees must demonstrate an ability to communicate clearly and grammatically in spoken and written English.\r\nA strong desire to impact positively on the learning of pupils within a nursery or primary school setting.","otherRequirements":"Assessments of fundamental English and mathematics will be undertaken at interview.  Shortfalls must be addressed by the trainee teacher before the award of QTS.\r\n\r\nPrior experience in school is not required.  However, where candidates have been able to gain experience in schools, Shire might find references from these schools  a helpful part of our R&S process.\r\n\r\nDisclosure and Barring Service/Medical\r\nWe are committed to safeguarding the welfare of children. All applicants who are offered a training place will be required to undertake a Disclosure and Barring Check and a medical check prior to the start of their employment in school. \r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:59.672Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-20T11:20:42.430Z","canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","cycle":"2023","salaryDetails":"For the duration of the training year, trainees are employed as an unqualified teacher within their employing school.
