For more information, please see our [Fees and finance]( https://www.exeter.ac.uk/teachertraining/apply/feesandfinance/) webpages.","financialSupport":"For information on Government loans and training bursaries, please visit the [Student Finance England]( https://www.gov.uk/student-finance) and [Get into Teaching]( https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/) websites.\r\n\r\nThe University of Exeter offers a £520 bursary to all UK students studying for a PGCE with us, whose household income is £25,000 or less. There is no separate application procedure for this bursary. Instead, we make an assessment using the household income information you provide to Student Finance England (you must make sure you give consent for details of your SfE application to be shared with the University of Exeter). This consent to share is requested during the application for financial support, but can be given at any time throughout the year by contacting SfE. \r\n\r\nFor more information, please see our [Fees and finance]( https://www.exeter.ac.uk/teachertraining/apply/feesandfinance/) webpages","aboutCourse":"We run different pathways within our Primary PGCE programme and applicants should apply to the [pathway(s)](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/teachertraining/primary/structure/) they are interested in.  Our [Primary Teaching & Learning course](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/teachertraining/primary/teachingandlearning/) trains you to become a primary classroom teacher but also provides an additional strand in primary teaching & learning to help prepare you to become a future coordinator in curriculum innovation.\r\n\r\nThe components:\r\n1.Curriculum studies - includes preparation for teaching the core subjects (English, Mathematics, and Science) and the subjects of Art, Computing, D&T, Geography, History, Modern Languages, Music, PE, and RE, delivered in shorter practical courses. These courses cater for trainees whose previous experiences may vary widely and give a substantial introduction to teaching these subjects. \r\n\r\n2.Educational and Professional Studies - is designed to enable critical reflection on children’s learning and development, pedagogy, diversity, and teachers’ roles and responsibilities in multi-professional contexts and includes one 30 credit Masters-level assignment.\r\n\r\n3.School experience - Central to the course is the developing your ability to meet the DfE’s Teachers’ Standards in order to be recommended for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). School-based tutors and mentors are responsible for your learning & development and receive well-designed training. You initially work with groups of children, before taking on more responsibility for planning and independently teaching whole classes. You will have two main placements offering contrasting environments.\r\n\r\n4.Pathway module (Teaching & Learning) - This pathway is for those who do not wish to choose a subject specialism, but are instead interested in developing knowledge, understanding and skills in research-inspired primary teaching and learning across the whole 5-11 curriculum.  Practical workshops and seminars make up the taught component, with contributions from school partners. Themes are taken from the Cambridge Primary Review Trust which examines facets of primary teaching and learning from national and international perspectives, offering a contemporary and critical view of primary education in theory and practice.  It includes one 30 credit Masters-level assignment.\r\n\r\nNote: The DfE entry requirement to pass professional skills tests in literacy and numeracy was removed in 2020. Instead trainees are now benchmarked during their training against a Government-defined set of fundamental mathematics and English skills. This is embedded into the training and does not involve any specific testing at interview. Trainees are given tools to help identify areas for development where needed.  The course includes activities to enable trainees to demonstrate the requisite skills by the end of the course.","interviewProcess":"For 2022-23 the interview process will take place online (this may change to face-to-face interviews later in the cycle, depending on the covid situation).   It comprises various elements, all designed so that you can showcase (and so we can assess) your skills, attributes and subject knowledge.  We notify all interviewees ahead of time what will be expected of them at interview, so you have plenty of time to prepare. \r\n\r\n * You will be sent a link to an online welcome presentation and some subject-specific information prior to the interview so you can find out about the structure of the programme, including school placements and the taught course \r\n * You will also be sent a link to a video and asked to submit a written reflection prior to the interview.\r\n * You will be asked to prepare a short presentation in which you present a teaching idea using an artefact of your choice\r\n * There will be a one-to-one interview with an Admissions Tutor, during which you will show your short presentation. This is where Subject Tutors will discuss your application, your suitability for teaching and your subject knowledge. This is also an opportunity to learn about the particular course you are applying for.  The Admissions Tutor may be joined by a teacher from one of our partner schools.\r\n\r\nThe interview process is designed to give you a flavour of the programme. There will be plenty of opportunities to ask questions. You should allow approximately half a day for the interview.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will be working within at least two schools during the course and all of our partner schools have specially trained mentors who will assist you in learning to teach. These colleagues are essential to your development as a teacher and will help you to develop both classroom skills and reflective and evaluative strategies. Together with schools, we will provide you with opportunities, training and support.\r\n\r\nTerm 1 begins with two weeks of observation (preliminary school experience known as 'Anticipating Practice'). This leads into the university-based course which focuses on professional development, specialist subject knowledge, pedagogy and teaching skills. In November you will spend two weeks in your first placement school to begin your classroom practice.\r\n\r\nTerm 2 is spent in your first placement school with three seminar days led by the university. \r\n\r\nTerm 3 is spent in your second placement school with two seminar days led by the university. \r\n\r\nThe University of Exeter currently has partnership agreements with over 250 schools across most parts of the South West (Cornwall, Devon, Dorset and Somerset) as well as a small number of primary schools in London.\r\n\r\nEvery effort is made to take into consideration your personal circumstances and preferences when allocating your placements. Trainees generally live in and around Exeter or commute to Exeter for the Autumn term, and then move to the area their placements will be in. Once on placement, there are 5 seminar days led by the university throughout the year, offering the opportunity to share experiences and good practice. You can claim a contribution towards expenses for these days if you are living away from Exeter and the sessions are on campus.\r\n\r\nOur accommodation office can offer advice regarding finding accommodation for the Autumn term. Many trainees will be placed further afield than Exeter for the whole of their school-based work, and will need to find accommodation in that area. Once registered, we provide an accommodation database, which lists many accommodation options previously used by our trainees. Many trainees live together during their time on placement and some live with school staff.\r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for applicants with an interest in primary education who have the drive to become critically reflective teachers and change agents.\r\n\r\nWhile as standard we normally only accept applicants who meet the 2:1 and above criteria, if you have a 2:2 or equivalent, or are coming from a different academic background equivalent to degree level, you are welcome to make an application for consideration or contact our PGCE Admissions team for more information. Diverse teachers enrich schools and pupils' experiences and we value diversity in schools and encourage potential teachers from a range of backgrounds to consider applying.","otherRequirements":"In addition to the academic requirements listed, selection is based on performance at interview and a satisfactory fitness to teach assessment and DBS enhanced disclosure.\r\n\r\nAlthough not essential it would be advantageous to be able to reflect on any school-based experience or experience working with young people in another context at interview.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:46:44.170Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-04T10:31:40.326Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
