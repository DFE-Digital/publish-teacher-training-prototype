The PGCE will involve writing assignments that are designed to help trainees to plan their teaching effectively and imaginatively, and to evaluate their developing knowledge and skills, particularly in terms of the quality of learning achieved by pupils. Successful completion will result in 60 master's-level credits.","interviewProcess":"Shortlisted applicants will be invited for interview at one of our main partnership schools, usually within two to three weeks of application.\r\n\r\nThe interview process will include a written task and a virtual interview with a senior member of staff and the ITTCo. \r\n\r\nIf successful, you will be contacted by the University of Reading, who will invite you to an initial needs meeting and a formal offer will then be made through UCAS from the University.
