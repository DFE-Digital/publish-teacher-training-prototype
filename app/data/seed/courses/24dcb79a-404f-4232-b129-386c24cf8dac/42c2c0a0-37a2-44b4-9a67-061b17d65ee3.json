These sessions are where you will receive input and support and have the opportunity to meet with other trainees. You will  be assigned a school mentor, whom you will meet with once a week. A tutor from the University will also visit you regularly.","interviewProcess":"Shortlisted applicants will be invited for a face to face interview, with one of our main partnership schools, usually within two to three weeks of application.\r\n\r\nThe interview process will include a tour of the school, a written task, a pupil panel and an interview with a senior member of staff and the ITTCo. \r\n\r\nIf successful, you will be contacted by the University of Reading, who will invite you to an initial needs meeting and a formal offer will then be made through UCAS from the University.
