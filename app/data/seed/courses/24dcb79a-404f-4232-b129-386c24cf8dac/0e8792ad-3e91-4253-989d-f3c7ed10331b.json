The PGCE will involve writing assignments that are designed to help trainees to plan their teaching effectively and imaginatively, and to evaluate their developing knowledge and skills, particularly in terms of the quality of learning achieved by pupils. Successful completion will result in 60 master's-level credits.","interviewProcess":"Shortlisted applicants will be invited for a face to face interview, with one of our main partnership schools, usually within two to three weeks of application.\r\n\r\nThe interview process will include a tour of the school, a written task, a pupil panel and an interview with a senior member of staff and the ITTCo. \r\n\r\nIf successful, you will be contacted by the University of Reading, who will invite you to an initial needs meeting and a formal offer will then be made through UCAS from the University. ","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"On a Secondary PGCE course through the University of Reading you are required to carry out two placements - ensuring you receive a broad range of experiences.\r\n\r\nTrinity is the main school placement for all of our courses and a second placement of 6 weeks after Christmas will take place in a school in West Berkshire or the surrounding area. \r\n\r\nMost second school placements will be found locally and the placements are found with the individual needs of the trainee in mind.
