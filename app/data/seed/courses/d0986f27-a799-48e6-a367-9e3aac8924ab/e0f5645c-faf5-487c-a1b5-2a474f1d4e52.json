We are committed to providing the highest quality professional learning for trainee teachers, supporting them to have the biggest impact in the classroom and providing an excellent foundation for a successful career in education. \r\n\r\nArk Teacher Training gives you a firm and solid foundation in how to teach chemistry. Over the year you will have regular training sessions which are focused on how to be a great teacher of chemistry. During these sessions, we will cover a range of teaching approaches and methods to inspire and motivate pupils. \r\n\r\nWe will also cover how to teach children the analytical and mathematical skills that are critical to chemistry, whilst covering approaches to ensure that pupils have a solid grasp of core concepts across all three sciences. \r\n\r\nAcross our network, our chemistry teachers also have the chance to share resources and ideas between their own school and other partnership schools. They come together in subject-specific hub days, and work with our Network Lead for Science to improve the Science provision for KS3, GCSE and A-level across the network. By collaborating like this, all our chemistry teachers have great support, and are equipped with the tools to enable our pupils to receive the best possible education.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Once you've checked you're [eligible](https://www.arkteachertraining.org/apply-now/eligibility-criteria/), you can submit your application directly through the Apply portal, or use our own ‘Apply Now’ form on our website. \r\n\r\n* We'll assess your application and let you know whether you meet our [selection criteria](https://www.arkteachertraining.org/characteristics-and-qualities/). \r\n\r\n* Applicants who meet our criteria are sent an online situational judgement test to complete. You can preview the format of this test [here](https://www.arkteachertraining.org/apply-now/how-to-apply/)\r\n\r\n*Pre-recorded video screening\r\nIf we need more information following your application form, you may be asked to record yourself on video, answering 5 questions that will allow you to articulate your skills and experiences that are transferable to teaching and give us a clearer idea of your potential on our programme.\r\n\r\n* Shortlisted applicants are then invited to our first assessment stage with a recruiter: a video interview and pre-prepared presentation. \r\n\r\n* Successful applicants proceed to the final, school-led assessment. Given ongoing covid restrictions, this is a video interview with a Principal from one of our schools, plus members of our programme delivery and recruitment teams. You'll 'teach' a short lesson and be asked to respond to feedback, and demonstrate your subject knowledge as well as your readiness to train to teach. \r\n\r\nIf you're successful, we'll match you with the school in our network that best fits your profile, and you'll be offered a place there.\r\n\r\nIf you applied through our website originally, we'll ask you to complete your Apply form at this stage so we can finalise our decision through the formal portal.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Your training school - in London, Birmingham, Hastings or Portsmouth - will be matched to your particular profile as a candidate, while taking into account your commuting distance and funding/subject preferences (and availability on our programme, which changes as we move through the recruitment cycle). \r\n\r\nBecause of Covid-19 restrictions and pressures on schools regarding external visitors, you may not be able to visit your school before accepting an offer there. However, please be assured that schools are equally as keen to invite you to visit in person and will work with you to arrange this as soon as they can (most likely after your DBS check has been completed). \r\n\r\nThe training programme itself is 100% school-based, but you will come out of school to spend a half day every week in a session with your Ark tutor and other trainees from the network. \r\n\r\nYou’ll also obtain experience in different schools throughout the year; you will have a three week placement in a different school to your own, and will also have the opportunity to visit other educational settings.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-10-11T10:31:24.094Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-11T10:33:01.096Z","canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","cycle":"2024"}
