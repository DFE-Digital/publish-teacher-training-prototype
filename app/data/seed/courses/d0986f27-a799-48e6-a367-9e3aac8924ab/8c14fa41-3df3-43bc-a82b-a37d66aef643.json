We are committed to providing the highest quality professional learning for teaching apprentices, supporting them to have the biggest impact in the classroom and providing an excellent foundation for a successful career in education. As an apprentice, you will also undertake the End Point Assessment in the autumn term following your achievement of QTS, which takes the form of a classroom observation.\r\n\r\nMusic is a core part of life in many of our schools. Designed to build confidence and ability, and to harness a life-long love of a variety of music, the Ark Teacher Training Music programme offers a wealth of experience for pupils at all levels.\r\n\r\nOver the year you will have regular training sessions which are focused on how to be a great teacher of Music. During these sessions, we will cover a range of teaching approaches and our music teachers have the chance to share resources and ideas between their own school and other partnership schools. By collaborating like this, all our teachers have great support, and all our pupils receive the best possible education.","interviewProcess":"Once you've checked you're [eligible](https://www.arkteachertraining.org/apply-now/eligibility-criteria/), you can submit your application directly through the Apply portal, or use our own ‘Apply Now’ form on our website. \r\n\r\n* We'll assess your application and let you know whether you meet our [selection criteria](https://www.arkteachertraining.org/characteristics-and-qualities/). \r\n\r\n* Applicants who meet our criteria are sent an online situational judgement test to complete. You can preview the format of this test [here](https://www.arkteachertraining.org/apply-now/how-to-apply/)\r\n\r\n*Pre-recorded video screening\r\nIf we need more information following your application form, you may be asked to record yourself on video, answering 5 questions that will allow you to articulate your skills and experiences that are transferable to teaching and give us a clearer idea of your potential on our programme.\r\n\r\n* Shortlisted applicants are then invited to our first assessment stage with a recruiter: a video interview and pre-prepared presentation. \r\n\r\n* Successful applicants proceed to the final, school-led assessment. Given ongoing covid restrictions, this is a video interview with a Principal from one of our schools, plus members of our programme delivery and recruitment teams. You'll 'teach' a short lesson and be asked to respond to feedback, and demonstrate your subject knowledge as well as your readiness to train to teach. \r\n\r\nIf you're successful, we'll match you with the school in our network that best fits your profile, and you'll be offered a place there.\r\n\r\nIf you applied through our website originally, we'll ask you to complete your Apply form at this stage so we can finalise our decision through the formal portal.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Your training school - in London, Birmingham, Hastings or Portsmouth - will be matched to your particular profile as a candidate, while taking into account your commuting distance and funding/subject preferences (and availability on our programme, which changes as we move through the recruitment cycle). \r\n\r\nBecause of Covid-19 restrictions and pressures on schools regarding external visitors, you may not be able to visit your school before accepting an offer there. However, please be assured that schools are equally as keen to invite you to visit in person and will work with you to arrange this as soon as they can (most likely after your DBS check has been completed). \r\n\r\nThe apprenticeship itself is 100% school-based, but you will come out of school to spend a half day every week in a session with your Ark tutor and other trainees from the network as part of the apprenticeship's 20% off the job training.\r\n\r\nYou’ll also obtain experience in different schools throughout the year; you will have a three week placement in a different school to your own, and will also have the opportunity to visit other educational settings. Finally, at the end of the apprenticeship and at the beginning of your induction year, you will undertake an End Point Assessment.","personalQualities":"Our applicants have a huge variety of experience between them, all of which can be used in the classroom.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are some qualities we know all successful trainees have, regardless of their background or experience; we look for these at assessment: \r\n\r\n- Alignment with Ark’s values and ethos\r\n- Some experience with young people (doesn't have to be in a school)\r\n- Great communication skills\r\n- Resilience (teaching is hard!)\r\n- Curiosity and eagerness to learn\r\n- Self-awareness and keenness to hear/act on feedback (you'll receive a lot on our programme, every week!)","otherRequirements":"There's a great deal to think about when you make the decision to train as a teacher: it's an intensive year, but on Ark Teacher Training you'll be well-supported and have plenty of time with your fellow trainees for moral support every week. \r\n\r\nIf you have questions about areas not covered in this search tool so far, our website covers a lot of specific information on our programme.
