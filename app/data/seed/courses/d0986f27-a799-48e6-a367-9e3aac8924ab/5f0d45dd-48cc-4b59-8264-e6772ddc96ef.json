We are committed to providing the highest quality professional learning for trainee teachers, supporting them to have the biggest impact in the classroom and providing an excellent foundation for a successful career in education. \r\n\r\nMusic is a core part of life in many of our schools. Designed to build confidence and ability, and to harness a life-long love of a variety of music, the Ark Teacher Training Music programme offers a wealth of experience for pupils at all levels.\r\n\r\nOver the year you will have regular training sessions which are focused on how to be a great teacher of Music. During these sessions, we will cover a range of teaching approaches and our music teachers have the chance to share resources and ideas between their own school and other partnership schools. By collaborating like this, all our teachers have great support, and all our pupils receive the best possible education.","interviewProcess":"Once you've checked that you're [eligible](https://www.arkteachertraining.org/apply-now/eligibility-criteria/), you can either submit your application directly through the UCAS or Apply portals, or use our own ‘Apply Now’ form, which is available on our website. \r\n\r\n* We will assess your application and let you know whether or not you meet our [selection criteria](https://www.arkteachertraining.org/characteristics-and-qualities/). \r\n* Applicants who meet our criteria will be sent two online tests to complete: a situational judgement assessment and a subject knowledge test. You can have a look at the format of the situational judgement test on our website, [here](https://www.arkteachertraining.org/apply-now/how-to-apply/)\r\n\r\n* If your application is shortlisted, you'll be invited to our first stage of assessment with a recruiter: a video interview and pre-prepared presentation. \r\n\r\n* Successful applicants will then proceed to the final, school-led assessment. Due to Covid-19, this will be a video call with an interview panel consisting of a senior leadership team member or Principal of one of our partner schools, as well as members of our programme delivery and recruitment teams. You'll 'teach' a short lesson and be asked to respond to feedback, as well as answer some questions to help us further determine your readiness to train to teach. \r\n\r\nIf you're successful, we'll match you with the school in our network that best fits your profile, and you'll be offered a place there.\r\n\r\nIf you applied through our website originally, we'll ask you to complete your UCAS form at this stage so we can finalise our decision through the formal portal.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Your training school - in London, Birmingham, Hastings or Portsmouth - will be matched to your particular profile as a candidate, while taking into account your commuting distance and funding/subject preferences (and availability on our programme, which changes as we move through the recruitment cycle). \r\n\r\nBecause of Covid-19 restrictions and pressures on schools regarding external visitors, you may not be able to visit your school before accepting an offer there. However, please be assured that schools are equally as keen to invite you to visit in person and will work with you to arrange this as soon as they can (most likely after your DBS check has been completed). \r\n\r\nThe training programme itself is 100% school-based, but you will come out of school to spend a half day every week in a session with your Ark tutor and other trainees from the network. \r\n\r\nYou’ll also obtain experience in different schools throughout the year; you will have a three week placement in a different school to your own, and will also have the opportunity to visit other educational settings.\r\n","personalQualities":"Our applicants have a huge variety of experience between them, all of which can be used in the classroom.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are some qualities we know all successful trainees have, regardless of their background or experience; we look for these at assessment: \r\n\r\n- Alignment with Ark’s values and ethos\r\n- Some experience with young people (doesn't have to be in a school)\r\n- Great communication skills\r\n- Resilience (teaching is hard!)\r\n- Curiosity and eagerness to learn\r\n- Self-awareness and keenness to hear/act on feedback (you'll receive a lot on our programme, every week!)","otherRequirements":"There's a great deal to think about when you make the decision to train as a teacher: it's an intensive year, but on Ark Teacher Training you'll be well-supported and have plenty of time with your fellow trainees for moral support every week. \r\n\r\nIf you have questions about areas not covered in this search tool so far, our website covers a lot of specific information on our programme. Check out our ['Frequently Asked Questions'](https://www.arkteachertraining.org/apply-now/application-faqs/) if you can't find what you're looking for!","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:51:34.091Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-27T13:53:42.578Z","canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","cycle":"2024","salaryDetails":"For a full overview of the funding available on Ark Teacher Training, please see our website's [funding page](https://www.arkteachertraining.org/your-training-year/funding/). \r\n\r\n- On the salaried route, you will be paid a salary on the unqualified teacher payscale - usually trainees are paid at point 1. The amount varies depending on the Ark region you will be training in (London or outside). \r\n\r\n- Your school will also pay your £9,250 tuition fee\r\n\r\n- If your preference is for the salaried route but you could in fact afford to train on the School Direct (tuition fee) route, we'd recommend you apply for the non-salaried route. Our places get taken up very quickly, but our schools tend to have more School Direct places available than they do on the SD Salaried route so your options remain wider if you can train on the non-salaried route. \r\n\r\nLet us know at point of application and we’ll check with you again in the interview if you’re shortlisted."}
