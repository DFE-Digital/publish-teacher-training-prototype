Our course is delivered in partnership with Plymouth Marjon University.\r\n\r\nThis one-year apprenticeship commences on 27th June 2022 until 31st July 2023. This is a full-time employment-based route into teaching. Primary apprentices will be employed within one of Dartmoor Multi Academy Trust’s primary schools for the duration of the apprenticeship. \r\n\r\nPrimary apprentices will combine study with practical on-the-job training, whilst also receiving a salary. Apprentices will work towards the Apprenticeship Standard, which sets out the knowledge, skills, values and behaviours of the apprentice and Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).  Apprentices will need to successfully complete an end-point assessment as part of the apprenticeship. This is a QTS only course. There is no PGCE qualification. \r\n\r\nDuring the apprenticeship, apprentices will split their time between school and university study.  Primary apprentices will receive practical, school-led training alongside experienced staff and spend at least 20% of their time off-timetable to learn how to teach. Apprentices will also receive weekly support from their school-based mentor. As the apprenticeship year progresses, apprentices will build up to a 70% classroom teaching commitment. \r\n","interviewProcess":"Applications are reviewed by the Dartmoor Teacher Training Partnership.
