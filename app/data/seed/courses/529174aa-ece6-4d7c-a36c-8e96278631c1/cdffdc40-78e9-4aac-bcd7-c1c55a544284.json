Three days a week will be spent in your placement school, where you will be supported by a team of experienced teachers and gain first-hand teaching experience. A fifth day will be allocated to completion of the PGCE element of the course, which is delivered by the University of Exeter through their online Distance Learning programme. \r\n\r\nTrainees’ main placements will be in early years and key stage 1.
