It is a great privilege, as well as a great responsibility, to be one of the first teachers to influence a child.\r\n\r\nIn this one-year postgraduate course you study the Foundation Curriculum and the core National Curriculum at Key Stage 1 (English, mathematics and science), and are particularly equipped to teach the Foundation Curriculum to pre-school and reception children and Key Stage 1. You also study theory surrounding early childhood learning.\r\n\r\nEarly Years students have 'taster' courses in the foundation subjects.\r\n\r\nThis is a very popular course and competition for places is high, so an early application is essential (please note the [UTT](https://www.ucas.com/teaching-in-the-uk) dates for applications). We regret that fierce competition for a limited number of places means that we have to disappoint many candidates. You should ensure that you meet the entry requirements and have sufficient observation experience in relevant settings.","interviewProcess":"","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Placements are offered by schools and settings within our ITE partnership and are geographically diverse, with schools in Bristol, South Gloucestershire, Bath and North East Somerset, Somerset, Wiltshire and Wales offering placements. We work hard to match placements to trainee teacher needs and experience, and we endeavour to keep travel times to a maximum of 90 minutes each way, each day.\r\n\r\nTrainee teachers are supported in schools by a Senior Mentor, who is a designated lead teacher for ITE placements in the school, and is responsible for overseeing the training that takes place. Trainee teachers are also closely supported by their Class Mentor (Primary) or Subject Mentor (Secondary), who is their day-to-day contact and supporter in school during placement.","personalQualities":"Our PGCE programmes include a high level of placement based learning and working with children. We would encourage all applicants to get as much relevant experience of working or volunteering with children to help prepare them for this crucial element of their programme.","otherRequirements":"All offers will be subject to satisfactory DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) and health checks.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:48.181Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-01T15:32:38.425Z","cycle":"2023","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
