If you successfully complete this route you will be in a strong position to gain employment as teachers of Biology and general science to KS4.\r\n\r\nThis course has been designed to train teachers to practise as a subject specialist teacher for the secondary age range (11-16). You will be assessed against the standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) across the age range. You will also often gain experience of the 16-18 age range, although they will not be formally assessed in this phase.\r\n\r\nThis course is active and practical allowing you to develop professional competence through work undertaken in schools and in the university. You will work with young people, develop expertise in your specialist subject area, share and discuss educational issues and study relevant educational research. The course is just the beginning of what we hope will be a process of continual professional development throughout a challenging and rewarding career.\r\n\r\nGuiding young people to develop an understanding of how scientists set about investigating the world, what science can answer and, probably more important in some ways, what it cannot, is exciting and very rewarding. Helping pupils to address misconceptions whilst facing some of your own is certainly a challenging yet fulfilling task.\r\n\r\nMany trainee teachers take a SKE course in order to help develop their subject knowledge in preparation for their PGCE course . It may be a condition of your offer to complete one.  These courses are designed to be flexible; they can be tailored to meet your specific study requirements, and can be planned around your commitments.\r\n\r\nSKE courses are funded by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, and you may be eligible for a tax-free Â£175 weekly bursary whilst studying your SKE.\r\n\r\nFind out why you should [train to teach with us](https://www1.uwe.ac.uk/cahe/edu/courses/secondaryite.aspx).\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Placements are offered by schools and settings within our ITE partnership and are geographically diverse, with schools in Bristol, South Gloucestershire, Bath and North East Somerset, Somerset, Wiltshire, Devon, Cornwall and Wales, offering placements. We work hard to match placements to trainee teacher needs and experience, and we endeavour to keep travel times to a maximum of 90 minutes each way, each day.\r\n\r\nTrainee teachers are supported in schools by a Senior Mentor, who is a designated lead teacher for ITE placements in the school, and is responsible for overseeing the training that takes place. Trainee teachers are also closely supported by their Class Mentor (Primary) or Subject Mentor (Secondary), who is their day-to-day contact and supporter in school during placement.","personalQualities":"Our PGCE programmes include a high level of placement based learning and working with children. We would encourage all applicants to get as much relevant experience of working or volunteering with children to help prepare them for this crucial element of their programme.","otherRequirements":"All offers will be subject to satisfactory DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) and health checks.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:47.700Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-01T15:07:48.698Z","cycle":"2023","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
