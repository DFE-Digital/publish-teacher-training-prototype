Study your chosen course over one year full-time or two years part-time, giving you the flexibility to fit your studies around your other commitments.\r\n\r\nUWE Bristol is committed to training the best teachers for the future, able to provide first-class educational experiences and make a significant difference to children's lives. We'll train you to do so in partnership with your schools or educational settings.\r\n\r\nTeaching is a challenging, exciting and rewarding career, with a high level of job satisfaction. It's a great privilege, as well as a great responsibility, to be able to influence and shape the progress of children and young people.  All children deserve to learn well, with enthusiastic specialist teachers.\r\n\r\nTo undertake the course, you must be in a role, or secure a role, in a school. This will enable you to undertake the required teaching practice specified by the Department for Education (DfE), which must be agreed by UWE Bristol before starting the course.\r\n\r\nYour teaching practice will need to include some time spent in an alternative placement school, ensuring you'll gain a variety of teaching experience.  The schools involved will need to support your engagement with and progression through the course.\r\n\r\nThe Secondary Postgraduate Certificate in Education is a course that trains graduates to be secondary school teachers of geography.\r\n\r\nThe online PGCE programme has been designed to train teachers to practise as a subject specialist teacher for the secondary age range (11-16). Trainees are assessed against the standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) across the age range. Trainees will also often gain experience of the 16-18 age range, although they won't be formally assessed in this phase.\r\n\r\nThis course is aimed at those with a passion for geography, who also enjoy working with young people.   Secondary school students need teachers who can motivate, inspire and challenge them through a wide range of innovative and creative lessons. The PGCE Online Distance Learning Secondary Geography course at UWE Bristol will support you to become a confident and competent geography teacher.","interviewProcess":"","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You'll complete two school-based placements that you'll need to organise before starting the course.
