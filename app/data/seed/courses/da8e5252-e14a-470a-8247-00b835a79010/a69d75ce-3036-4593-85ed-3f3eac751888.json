Trainees are assessed against the standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) across the age range. Trainees will also often gain experience of the 16-18 age range, although they will not be formally assessed in this phase.\r\n\r\nIf you have a passion for geography and enjoy working with young people then this is course for you! At UWE and through working in our partnership schools you will learn to become a teacher of geography who feels equipped to cope with the demands of secondary school teaching today. Secondary school students need teachers who can motivate, inspire and challenge them through a wide range of innovative and creative lessons. The PGCE Secondary Geography course at UWE will support you in becoming a confident and competent teacher of geography.\r\n\r\nThe course is active and practical allowing trainees to develop professional competence through work undertaken in schools and in the University. Trainees work with young people, develop their expertise in their specialist subject area, share and discuss educational issues and study relevant educational research. The course is just the beginning of what we hope will be a process of continual professional development throughout a challenging and rewarding career.\r\n\r\nFind out why you should [train to teach with us](https://www1.uwe.ac.uk/cahe/edu/courses/secondaryite.aspx).\r\n","interviewProcess":"","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Placements are offered by schools and settings within our ITE partnership and are geographically diverse, with schools in Bristol, South Gloucestershire, Bath and North East Somerset, Somerset, Wiltshire, Devon, Cornwall and Wales, offering placements. We work hard to match placements to trainee teacher needs and experience, and we endeavour to keep travel times to a maximum of 90 minutes each way, each day.\r\n\r\nTrainee teachers are supported in schools by a Senior Mentor, who is a designated lead teacher for ITE placements in the school, and is responsible for overseeing the training that takes place. Trainee teachers are also closely supported by their Class Mentor (Primary) or Subject Mentor (Secondary), who is their day-to-day contact and supporter in school during placement.","personalQualities":"Our PGCE programmes include a high level of placement based learning and working with children. We would encourage all applicants to get as much relevant experience of working or volunteering with children to help prepare them for this crucial element of their programme.\r\n\r\nApplicants who do not meet the minimum academic entry requirements, but have significant life and/or work experience will be considered on an individual basis.","otherRequirements":"All offers will be subject to satisfactory DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) and health checks.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:47.902Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-01T15:18:54.394Z","cycle":"2023","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
