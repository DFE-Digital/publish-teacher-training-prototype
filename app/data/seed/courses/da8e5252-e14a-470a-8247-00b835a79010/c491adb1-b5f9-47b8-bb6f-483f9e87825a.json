Study your chosen course over one year full-time or two years part-time, giving you the flexibility to fit your studies around your other commitments.\r\n\r\nUWE Bristol is committed to training the best teachers for the future, able to provide first-class educational experiences and make a significant difference to children's lives. We'll train you to do so in partnership with your schools or educational settings.\r\n\r\nTeaching is a challenging, exciting and rewarding career with a high level of job satisfaction. It's a great privilege, as well as a great responsibility, to be able to influence and shape the progress of children and young people.  All children deserve to learn well, with enthusiastic specialist teachers.\r\n\r\nTo undertake the course, you must be in a role, or secure a role, in a school. This will enable you to undertake the required teaching practice specified by the Department for Education (DfE), which must be agreed by UWE Bristol before starting the course.\r\n\r\nYour teaching practice will need to include some time spent in an alternative placement school, ensuring you'll gain a variety of teaching experience.  The schools involved will need to support your engagement with and progression through the course.\r\n\r\nThis PGCE course has been designed to train teachers to practise as a Computer Science specialist teacher for the secondary age range (11-16). Trainees are assessed against the standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) across the age range. Trainees will also often gain experience of the 16-18 age range, although they won't be formally assessed in this phase.\r\n\r\nIn the PGCE Computer Science you'll be equipped to move onto the next stage of your profession as an early career teacher. You'll learn to teach across the key stages in the Computer Science classroom and across the discipline. This course will enable you to become a confident teacher, able to support learners to be users and creators of technology, giving students the opportunity to think, create, be resilient and grow.","interviewProcess":"","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You'll complete two school-based placements that you'll need to organise before starting the course.
