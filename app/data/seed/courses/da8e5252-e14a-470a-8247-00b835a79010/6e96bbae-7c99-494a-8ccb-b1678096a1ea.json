Study your chosen course over one year full-time or two years part-time, giving you the flexibility to fit your studies around your other commitments.\r\n\r\nUWE Bristol is committed to training the best teachers for the future, able to provide first-class educational experiences and make a significant difference to children's lives. We'll train you to do so in partnership with your schools or educational settings.\r\n\r\nTeaching is a challenging, exciting and rewarding career, with a high level of job satisfaction. It's a great privilege, as well as a great responsibility, to be able to influence and shape the progress of children and young people.  All children deserve to learn well, with enthusiastic specialist teachers.\r\n\r\nTo undertake the course, you must be in a role, or secure a role, in a school. This will enable you to undertake the required teaching practice specified by the Department for Education (DfE), which must be agreed by UWE Bristol before starting the course.\r\n\r\nYour teaching practice will need to include some time spent in an alternative placement school, ensuring you'll gain a variety of teaching experience.  The schools involved will need to support your engagement with and progression through the course.\r\n\r\nThe Secondary Postgraduate Certificate in Education is a course that trains graduates to be secondary school teachers of history.  The online PGCE Secondary programme has been designed to train teachers to practise as a subject specialist teacher for the secondary age range (11-16). Trainees are assessed against the standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) across the age range. Trainees will also often gain experience of the 16-18 age range, although they won't be formally assessed in this phase.\r\n\r\nDo you believe that studying History is central to the broad and balanced education of any young person?  We do too, and we're looking for people with a passion for the subject and are keen to share their knowledge in a lively and engaging manner.  The course is active and practical, allowing trainees to develop their professional competence through work undertaken online and in schools. Trainees work with young people, develop their expertise in their specialist subject area, share and discuss educational issues and study relevant educational research. The course will kickstart your continual professional development throughout a challenging and rewarding career.","interviewProcess":"","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You'll complete two school-based placements that you'll need to organise before starting the course. You may be already employed by a school as a Teaching Assistant or Support Member of staff.\r\n\r\nTrainee teachers are supported in schools by their Class Mentor (Primary) or Subject Mentor (Secondary), who is their day-to-day contact and supporter in school during placement.","personalQualities":"","otherRequirements":"All offers will be subject to satisfactory DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) and health checks.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-09-24T10:29:01.605Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-04T15:41:04.490Z","cycle":"2023","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
