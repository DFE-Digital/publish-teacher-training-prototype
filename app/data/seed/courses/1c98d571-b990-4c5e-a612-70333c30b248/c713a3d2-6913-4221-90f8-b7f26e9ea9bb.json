You spend around 15 days at Sheffield Hallam in the year (travel from your \"home\" school is paid).\r\nYou will be assessed on your growing ability to teach over the year by your Learning Coach/ Mentor and on these assignments. \r\nBy the end of the course, we aim that you will be an outstanding primary class teacher with a specialism in teaching and leading PE.\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Once you have applied, you may be offered an interview.
