The significance of the qualifications can be found [here](https://www.wltta.org.uk/initial-teacher-training/primary-courses-for-sept-2022/qualification-outcomes/)\r\n\r\nSPECIAL FEATURES\r\n\r\nSome WLTTA primary courses (including this one) come with our unique school bursaries, see more in the finance section below!  We make prompt shortlisting decisions and will liaise with you quickly if we need additional information.\r\n\r\nWLTTA enables you to choose your host school.  Later, if there is a teaching vacancy and they want to retain you, you can be employed for the following year without the post being advertised.  By becoming a WLTTA trainee, all our other schools could employ you this way and we operate a pool.\r\n\r\nOur aim is to produce exceptional teachers who could remain in alliance schools to continue their careers, taking advantage of further professional development, including the accredited Early Career induction programme.\r\n\r\nTHE TRAINING\r\n\r\nThrough us, you enrol at the university and would attend all the same university sessions with those who applied directly through the university; have full access to university facilities/mentors.  The university still awards your PGCE.  \r\n\r\nWLTTA selects a contrasting school for your ‘away’ placement which occurs before your (longer) time at your chosen host school.\r\n\r\nAs a guide: [Typical timetable](https://www.wltta.org.uk/initial-teacher-training/st-marys-prim-unsal-typical-timetable/)\r\n\r\nThe university programme covers: teaching and assessing; classroom management; child protection; maths, English, science, music, history, drama, geography, art, design and technology, PE, MFL and Masters.  \r\n\r\nAt school, through an initial programme of observations you will become familiar with the organisation and working of the school (pupil groups and pastoral systems, staffing, curriculum, resources, facilities, approaches to learning and teaching, lesson planning and assessment. \r\n\r\nYou will be treated like a member of staff. With your school mentors, you will feel supported as you progress and become ready to teach. Our mentors are excellent teachers and undertake rigorous training to develop their mentoring skills. Your time in school provides you with the opportunity to develop your teaching expertise and relationships with children and young people in a familiar environment. \r\n\r\nYou will have the opportunity to teach a range of year groups (children aged 5-11) covering Maths, English and Science as well as other subjects and themed projects. You will have experience of the National Curriculum and teacher assessment.     \r\n\r\nYour university tutor will visit to monitor your progress at both schools and discuss your development with you and your mentors. You will maintain close links with your host school throughout the course. ","interviewProcess":"Our schools seek trainees that aspire to work for them. We enable you to select your preferred host school(s) at application and later through a referral process.  We provide information about the schools to help you choose.  \r\n\r\nSTAGE 1: UNIVERSITY INTERVIEW\r\n\r\nOnce shortlisted, we arrange for you to be invited to an online university interview. You will be asked to upload ID documents and relevant certificates if available.  We can still make an offer subject to later verification of qualifications.\r\n\r\nThe university may ask you to prepare a very brief presentation on a particular topic.   \r\n\r\nSTAGE 2: SCHOOL INTERVIEW\r\n \r\nThe school interview follows 3-4 days later and could lead to an offer.\r\n\r\nINTERNAL REFERRALS\r\n\r\nIf you do not get an offer from Stage 2 but have demonstrated potential, you can then choose another school and we would recommend your shortlisting.  The university interview would not be repeated.\r\nWe hope to fit good candidates with schools that they are happy with and where they can secure an offer.\r\n\r\nThere remains an advantage to apply to the course at more than one school, because such applications would be considered in parallel rather than sequentially. If you have a clear first choice, email us and we can try to ensure a sensible order for the interviews.\r\n\r\nAPPLICATIONS\r\n\r\nThe application process (using the button at the end of this listing) is intuitive, but we have made a short guide to the information you will need and how it works: [How application system works](https://www.wltta.org.uk/initial-teacher-training/primary-courses-for-sept-2022/how-application-system-works/).","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"CHOOSING YOUR SCHOOL\r\n\r\nWith WLTTA, you select the main host school at application.  We then later arrange your second placement at another contrasting WLTTA school to provide greater depth to your training experience. \r\n\r\nIf you want to see when you would be at the university; when at your main host school; and when the contrasting school, see our  typical timetable linked above.\r\n\r\nThe schools seeking trainees on this particular course are listed below.  \r\n\r\n* Bousfield Primary School, SW5\r\n* St Charles Catholic Primary School, W10\r\n* St James' Catholic Primary School, TW2\r\n* St Mary of the Angels RC Primary School, W2\r\n* St Mary's Catholic Primary School, W4\r\n* St Mary's Catholic Primary School, W10\r\n* Wendell Park Primary School, W12\r\n\r\nThe characters and location of our schools are varied.

We have many other primary teacher training courses at other schools including a few salaried places.  You can download the course document for any of our courses; and see a video about us, with previous trainees being interviewed.  \r\n\r\nYou can also sign up there to join our fortnightly Zoom presentation about getting into teaching and it includes an opportunity for Q&A. The presentation explains all about the different routes into teaching and their separate benefits; how the money works; tips about using the 'Find Postgraduate Teacher Training' portal; applications; offers; etc.  No pressure, you don't have to attend this at all - it's just there for anyone who is trying to understand it all better.  We get excellent feedback on this year after year.","personalQualities":"We seek trainees with a passion to engage and inspire students to a love of learning,  who are:   \r\n\r\n* committed to championing their students;\r\n* open to learning about children’s physical/social/emotional/cognitive needs and how these can affect behaviour;\r\n* in good health with ability to cope with stress.  Teaching is incredibly rewarding, but also requires an element of resilience!\r\n* professional and committed to equal opportunities;\r\n* able to communicate well in written/spoken English, with at least basic computer skills and commitment to developing these.\r\n\r\nIt helps to have a sense of humour and an ability to laugh at yourself!","otherRequirements":"A realistic understanding of the role of a teacher and an awareness of some current issues facing the profession is also important.
