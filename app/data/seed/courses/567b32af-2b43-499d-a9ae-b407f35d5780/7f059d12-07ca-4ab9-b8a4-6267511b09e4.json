The programme focusses on ages 3-7 but once qualified would not restrict the primary ages you could teach.\r\n\r\nPOSTGRADUATE TEACHER APPRENTICESHIP\r\n\r\nThis is a nationally recognised, work-based route into teaching. It offers the postgraduate-level qualification with no tuition fees and the opportunity to earn while you learn. It is aimed primarily at candidates who have a good understanding of what it means to work in a school and have built up some experience, perhaps as a teaching assistant or in similar role. Many candidates are working in schools already and are looking to make the next step.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe programme is run by the West London Teacher Training Alliance (WLTTA) in partnership with London Metropolitan University.  We make prompt shortlisting decisions and liaise with you quickly if we need additional information.\r\n\r\nWLTTA enables you to choose your employing host school at application.  If later, there is a teaching vacancy in your school and they are keen to retain you as a qualified teacher, this can be done without the post being advertised.  By becoming a WLTTA trainee, all our schools could employ you this way and if you needed it, we operate a pool.  \r\n\r\nOur aim is to produce exceptional teachers who could remain in alliance schools to continue their careers, taking advantage of further professional development, including the accredited Early Career induction programme.\r\n\r\nTHE TRAINING\r\n\r\nYou will register at the university and be employed by your chosen school.\r\nYou will undertake off-the-job training, which will occupy 20% of your teaching time; this is split between face-to-face training at the University and independent training tasks in school.\r\n\r\nYou will receive an induction at the University. The course will then build on well-established and successful foundations by combining the expertise of the university’s course tutors who are experienced classroom practitioners and teacher trainers; with a dynamic curriculum designed to cater to your needs as a teacher apprentice. \r\n\r\nYou will be encouraged to reflect upon your own practice and to critically engage with current research, policy and pedagogy.\r\n\r\nIn the spring term you will gain experience in a contrasting (mainstream) school for approx. 6 weeks to add further depth to the training\r\n\r\nWith your school mentors you will feel supported as you progress and become ready to teach aiming for 40-60% by Christmas and building to 80% by the summer term. ","interviewProcess":"We enable you to select your preferred employing host school(s) at application and later through a referral process.  We provide information about the schools to help you choose.  \r\n\r\nSTAGE 1: SCHOOL INTERVIEW\r\n\r\nOnce shortlisted, we would invite you to an interview with your chosen school.  In addition to the panel interview, you may be asked to prepare in advance to carry out a task in the classroom, e.g. to discuss an object of your choice with the pupils; or to teach a specified topic to a small group for a short time.\r\n\r\nYou would also be asked to complete a short literacy/numeracy test.\r\n\r\nINTERNAL REFERRALS\r\n\r\nIf you are not selected as the preferred candidate, but have demonstrated potential, you can then choose another school or programme of ours and we would recommend you for shortlisting.  We hope to fit good candidates with schools that they are happy with and where they can secure an offer.\r\n\r\nThere remains an advantage however in initially applying for a place at more than one of our schools, because such applications would be considered in parallel rather than sequentially. \r\n\r\nSTAGE 2: UNIVERSITY INTERVEW & DIAGNOSITIC ASSESSMENT \r\n\r\nIf you are selected from the school interview, we arrange for you to be invited to an online university interview and diagnostic assessment. \r\n\r\nYou will be asked to upload ID documents and relevant certificates if available.  We can still make an offer subject to later verification of qualifications.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"CHOOSING YOUR SCHOOL\r\n\r\nWith WLTTA, you select the main host school (or federation) at application.  We then later arrange your second placement at another contrasting WLTTA school to provide greater depth to your training experience. \r\n\r\nThe schools seeking trainees on this particular course are listed below.\r\n \r\n* John Perryn primary School, W3\r\n* Park Walk Primary School, SW10\r\n\r\nThe characters/location of our schools are varied.
