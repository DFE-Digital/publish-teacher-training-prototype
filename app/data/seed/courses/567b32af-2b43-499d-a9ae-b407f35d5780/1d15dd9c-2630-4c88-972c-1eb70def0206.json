The programme focusses on ages 5-11 but once qualified would not restrict the primary ages you could teach.\r\n\r\nPOSTGRADUATE TEACHER APPRENTICESHIP\r\n\r\nThis is a nationally recognised, work-based route into teaching. It offers the postgraduate-level qualification with no tuition fees and the opportunity to earn while you learn. It is aimed primarily at candidates who have a good understanding of what it means to work in a school and have built up some experience, perhaps as a teaching assistant or in similar role. Many candidates are working in schools already and are looking to make the next step.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe programme is run by the West London Teacher Training Alliance (WLTTA) in partnership with London Metropolitan University.  We make prompt shortlisting decisions and liaise with you quickly if we need additional information.\r\n\r\nWe have only one school trust with salaried vacancies –the Knowledge Schools Trust Primaries. They would interview for their group of three schools.  If later, they have a teaching vacancy  and they are keen to retain you as a qualified teacher, this can be done without the post being advertised.  By becoming a WLTTA trainee, all our schools could employ you this way.  \r\n\r\nOur aim is to produce exceptional teachers who could remain in alliance schools to continue their careers, taking advantage of further professional development, including the accredited Early Career induction programme.\r\n\r\nTHE TRAINING\r\n\r\nYou will register at the university and be employed by one of the Knowledge Schools Trust Primaries.\r\n\r\nYou will be located predominantly in your employing school but in the spring term you will gain experience in a contrasting school (chosen by WLTTA) for approx. 6 weeks to add further depth to your training.  \r\n\r\n20% of your time will be off-the-job training, split between the University and training tasks in school.\r\n\r\nAs a general guide, please see link to [a typical timetable](https://www.wltta.org.uk/initial-teacher-training/london-met-typical-timetable/)\r\n\r\nThe course combines the expertise of the university’s course tutors who are experienced classroom practitioners with teacher trainers. You will be encouraged to reflect upon your own practice and to engage with current research, policy and pedagogy.\r\n\r\nTEACHING LOAD \r\n\r\nWith your school mentors you will feel supported as you become ready to teach, aiming for 40-60% by Christmas (or higher for those with more experience). \r\n\r\nTeaching builds up to approx. 80% by the summer term. ","interviewProcess":"STAGE 1: SCHOOL INTERVIEW\r\n\r\nOnce shortlisted, we would invite you to an interview with the Knowledge Schools Trust.  In addition to the panel interview, you may be asked to prepare in advance, to carry out a task in the classroom e.g. to discuss an object of your choice with the pupils; or to teach a specified topic to a small group for a short time.\r\n\r\nYou would also be asked to complete a short literacy/numeracy test.\r\n\r\nINTERNAL REFERRALS\r\n\r\nIf you are not selected as the preferred candidate, but have demonstrated potential, you can then choose another school or programme of ours and we would recommend you for shortlisting.  We hope to fit good candidates with schools that they are happy with and where they can secure an offer.\r\n\r\nThere remains an advantage however in initially applying for a place at more than one of our schools, because such applications would be considered in parallel rather than sequentially. \r\n\r\nSTAGE 2: UNIVERSITY INTERVIEW & DIAGNOSITIC ASSESSMENT \r\n\r\nIf selected from the school interview, you will be invited to a university interview and diagnostic assessment -probably online.\r\n\r\nYou will be asked to prepare in advance a short presentation on a topic chosen by the university.\r\n\r\nFollowing the interview you will be given a link to complete online tests in Maths and English, with a two hour deadline for completion.\r\n\r\nYou may be asked to upload ID documents and relevant certificates if available.  We can still make an offer subject to later verification of qualifications.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"CHOOSING YOUR SCHOOL\r\n\r\nOn this particular course we only have vacancies at the  Knowledge Trust Primaries (3 schools W6, W6 & W14) and there is no opportunity to select another school at the application stage but see later below regarding referrals.\r\n\r\nWe then later arrange your second placement at another contrasting WLTTA school to provide greater depth to your training experience. \r\n\r\nThe characters/location of our schools are varied. To help you decide, please refer to our [WLTSA Primary School Summary Descriptions](https://www.wltta.org.uk/initial-teacher-training/primary-courses-for-sept-2022/wltta-primary-school-summary-descriptions/) and our [Map of WLTTA Schools.](https://www.wltta.org.uk/location-map-with-magnifier/) \r\n\r\nYou can contact us to ask how many applications (if any) are being considered by different schools when you are applying.\r\n  \r\nDETAILED WEBSITE AND LIVE ONLINE PRESENTATION & Q&A\r\n\r\nWe recommend that you visit our website [www.wltta.org.uk](https://www.wltta.org.uk/) to properly see all our vacancies.  We have many unsalaried courses, some of which uniquely come with a bursary from the schools. You can download the course document for any of our courses; and see a video about us, with previous trainees being interviewed.  \r\n\r\nYou can also sign up there to join our fortnightly Zoom presentation about getting into teaching and it includes an opportunity for Q&A. The presentation explains all about the different routes into teaching and their separate benefits; how the money works; tips about using the 'Find Postgraduate Teacher Training' portal; applications; offers; etc.  No pressure, you don't have to attend this at all - it's just there for anyone who is trying to understand it all better.  We get excellent feedback on this year after year.","personalQualities":"We seek trainees with a passion to engage and inspire students to a love of learning,  who are:   \r\n\r\n* committed to championing their students;\r\n* open to learning about children’s physical/social/emotional/cognitive needs and how these can affect behaviour;\r\n* in good health with ability to cope with stress.  Teaching is incredibly rewarding, but also requires an element of resilience!\r\n* professional and committed to equal opportunities;\r\n* able to communicate well in written/spoken English, with at least basic computer skills and commitment to developing these.\r\n\r\nIt helps to have a sense of humour and an ability to laugh at yourself!","otherRequirements":"A realistic understanding of the role of a teacher and an awareness of some current issues facing the profession is also important.  We have some advice relating to school experience on our website: [WLTTA School Experience tab](https://www.wltta.org.uk/initial-teacher-training/primary-courses-for-sept-2022/school-experience/)\r\n\r\nOffers are conditional on satisfactory outcome of a DBS check and an occupational health check both administered through the school after an offer is accepted.
