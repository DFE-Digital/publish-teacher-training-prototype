We are now recruiting trainee Primary School teachers for the new academic year including Early Years (ages 3-5), Key Stage 1 (ages 4-7) and Key Stage 2 (ages 8-11).\r\n\r\nOur primary teaching programmes give trainee teachers the opportunity to learn from, and alongside, experienced classroom practitioners. Trainees have the opportunity to carry out a range of training activities in two different schools and in two key stages. The programmes include observing experienced teachers; working with groups and the whole class; planning; teaching and assessing children and reflecting on their developing classroom practice. Trainees “learn on the job” and quickly develop a good understanding and practical experience of the full role of the teacher.\r\n\r\nAs well as one to one advice from experienced tutors and mentors we offer group training sessions which cover key themes such as providing for children with Special Educational Needs and behaviour management. Assignments and tasks are designed to allow trainees to put the theory into practice and to reflect on their training. Successful completion of either of these programmes leads to the award of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and the academic award of a Post Graduate Certificate of Education (PGCE). \r\n","interviewProcess":"Congratulations you've been invited to interview...\r\n\r\nShortlisted applicants are invited to interview by email.
