You will be eligible for the same financial support as other fee paying postgraduate teacher training routes. There are bursaries and scholarships available depending on your subject choice. More information can be found at: https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/funding-and-salary/overview\r\n ","aboutCourse":"The Bitterne Park Teaching School Alliance is a growing partnership comprising a diverse range of secondary schools across Hampshire and Wiltshire which present dynamic and exciting training possibilities for those wishing to pursue a career in teaching. Working in partnership with the University of Southampton, we have developed a bespoke teacher training package designed to produce reflective, analytical and effective classroom practitioners. During your training year, you will build upon your prior experience to gain the specific subject, curriculum and pedagogical knowledge that you need to become an effective and confident teacher with the full support of the University of Southampton including a university tutor and access to all facilities. Southampton University has a long-established record of excellent initial teacher training, and successful completion of our course will lead to a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) with Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).  The programme also contributes towards a Master's level qualification.\r\n\r\nAs a BPTSA School Direct trainee, you will have the opportunity to fully immerse yourself in school life and will be treated like any other member of the teaching staff. This approach will allow you to experience all aspects of the role of a teacher, both inside and outside the classroom. The practical nature of our course, combined with the opportunity to work alongside and learn from experienced, outstanding practitioners, constantly reinforces the link between theory and practice. We aim to ensure that by the end of the course you can teach your subject confidently and successfully by developing your skills as a problem solver, and by encouraging you to explore theoretical ideas and their practical application in the classroom.\r\n\r\nWe feel our School Direct training programme combines the best elements of a traditional university-led PGCE training model with the benefits of a school-centred approach.  \r\n\r\nOur core training involves: \r\n\r\n* a four-week induction at the start of the programme;\r\n* a progressive training programme delivered each Friday throughout the year;\r\n* a half term second school placement in a contrasting school; and\r\n* a primary, sixth form and SEN school experience.\r\n\r\nThroughout the programme, you will be supported by a highly skilled and trained mentor at your school, a professional mentor (a member of your school's senior leadership team) and a university tutor.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Once shortlisting has taken place, we will contact you to confirm whether you have been selected for interview. The interview process will consist of: \r\n\r\n* a formal interview with our Director of Teaching School and representatives from our partnership schools;\r\n* a written task; and\r\n* a presentation or teaching activity. \r\n\r\nDepending on COVID-19 guidance at the time of your application, your interview may be online or face-to-face. If your interview is online, you will be asked to give a short presentation. If we are able to offer you a face-to-face interview, you may be asked to teach a 20 minute micro lesson to a small group of pupils. \r\n\r\nThe selection panel will take evidence from all aspects of the interview into consideration when making their judgement. \r\n\r\nIf you are successful at interview, you may request a visit to the school where your main placement will be, so that you can meet the staff that will be involved in your training. \r\n\r\nUnsuccessful applicants will be offered feedback on their interview.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Our partnership currently consists of 14 secondary schools, predominantly in Hampshire with two schools in Wiltshire.  During your training year, you will have two school placements.  You will be placed in a host school for your main placement, and will undertake a half term second placement in another school in our partnership.  You will also be offered a primary, sixth form and SEN school experience.\r\n\r\nYou will have the opportunity to apply to a specific school on your UCAS application, or alternatively you can submit an ‘open’ application and discuss the various options available at interview.
