Working in partnership with the University of Chichester, we have developed a bespoke English teacher training package designed to produce reflective, analytical and effective classroom practitioners. During your training year, you will build upon your prior experience to gain the specific subject, curriculum and pedagogical knowledge that you need to become an effective and confident teacher of English. You will have the full support of the University of Chichester, including a university tutor and access to all facilities.  Your university-led training will take place in school, and you will not be required to travel to Chichester for training.  The University of Chichester is recognised as one of the leading institutions in the country for teacher training,  and successful completion of our course will lead to  a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) with Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). The programme also contributes towards a Master's level qualification.\r\n\r\nAs a BPTTA School Direct trainee, you will have the opportunity to fully immerse yourself in school life and will be treated like any other member of the teaching staff. This approach will allow you to experience all aspects of the role of a teacher, both inside and outside the classroom. The practical nature of our course, combined with the opportunity to work alongside and learn from experienced, outstanding practitioners, constantly reinforces the link between theory and practice. We aim to ensure that by the end of the course you can teach your subject confidently and successfully by developing your skills as a problem solver, and by encouraging you to explore theoretical ideas and their practical application in the classroom.\r\n\r\nOur core training involves: \r\n\r\n* a four-week induction at the start of the programme;\r\n* a progressive training programme delivered throughout the year, including 19 subject specific training days and 18 professional studies training days;\r\n* a 6-week second school placement in a contrasting school; and\r\n* a primary, sixth form and SEN school experience.\r\n\r\nThroughout the programme, you will be supported by a highly skilled and trained curriculum mentor at your school, a professional mentor who will oversee your training, and a university tutor.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Once shortlisting has taken place, we will contact you to confirm whether you have been selected for interview. The interview process will consist of: \r\n\r\n* a formal interview with our Director of ITT and representative from the University of Chichester; \r\n* a written task; and\r\n* a presentation.\r\n\r\nDepending on COVID-19 guidance at the time of your application, your interview may be online or face-to-face. If your interview is face-to-face, you may also be asked to teach a 20 minute micro lesson to a small group of pupils.\r\n \r\nThe selection panel will take evidence from all aspects of the interview into consideration when making their judgement. \r\n\r\nIf you are successful at interview, you may request a visit to the school where your main placement will be, so that you can meet the staff that will be involved in your training. \r\n\r\nUnsuccessful applicants will be offered feedback on their interview.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Our partnership currently consists of 13 secondary schools, predominantly in Hampshire with two schools in Wiltshire.  During your training year, you will have two school placements.
