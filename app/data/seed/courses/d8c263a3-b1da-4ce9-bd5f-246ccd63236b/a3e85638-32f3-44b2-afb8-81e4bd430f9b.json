Our selection process is thorough and designed to help you feel confident that the School Direct pathway is the right route into teaching for you. Interviews will be held at St John’s CofE Middle School in collaboration with our partner First, Primary and Middle Schools and the University of Worcester.\r\n\r\nThe interview will involve:\r\n\r\n* leading an activity with a small group of children;\r\n* a written activity based on some pre-reading;\r\n* an interview.\r\n\r\nAll details relating to the activity and the written task will be sent out in good time, prior to interview.\r\n\r\nThe interview day is always a very positive experience for all concerned.

Throughout your school experience, you will gain experience in two different key stages in order to meet the requirements of the qualification.  Your School Experience 1 (Autumn) and School Experience 3 (Summer) will be based at your main school.  School Experience 2, (Spring), will be based in a contrasting school.  Your main school will be determined by the South Bromsgrove Teaching School Alliance in collaboration with the Primary Lead at St John's CofE Middle School and the University of Worcester. In placing trainees, we will take account of your location and specific training needs. We are keen to expand our partnership of schools, should trainees wish to train in specific schools, with whom they have existing links. All partnership schools are subject to Quality Assurance procedures, carried out by the University of Worcester.\r\n\r\nTrainees will spend the majority of the time in school, but will spend one day a week in Professional Studies sessions. This will take place either at the University of Worcester or one of our alliance schools. These sessions cover all aspects of the Teacher Standards and draw on the extensive expertise from within the South Bromsgrove Teaching School Alliance. Through our programme, you will be able to visit a range of different schools and institutions and network with staff and trainees from across our network. We take a huge amount of pride in our Professional Studies as we ensure that the course not only prepares trainees for the demands of the training year (including teaching practice and assignments), but also prepares trainees for a career in primary education. \r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"What are we looking for – Applicants will need to demonstrate:\r\n\r\n* A commitment to the welfare and well-being of young people;\r\n* Enthusiasm for teaching and an ability to relate to young people;\r\n* A passion for your subject and for education in general;\r\n* A willingness to learn through experience and respond to feedback;\r\n* Some prior school experience is strongly recommended.","otherRequirements":"Prospective trainees will be subject to an Enhanced DBS check.
