The course involves a combination of practical teaching experience and taught modules on pedagogy and broader aspects of education. Trainees will be placed at South Bromsgrove High Academy for the main placement and will undertake a second, contrasting school experience placement at another school.  Second school placements will be arranged during the first term and will be carefully matched to the needs of the trainee.\r\n\r\nThe professional studies element of the course will be coordinated by Haybridge Alliance SCITT on a particular day each week. The unique aspect of this programme is that the delivery will be shared across schools in a wider alliance, who have specific areas of expertise. This will also allow insight into First, Middle, High and Special Schools. Much of the Professional Studies element will involve linking theory to classroom practice.\r\n \r\nThe subject based elements of the programme will be delivered in collaboration with Haybridge Alliance SCITT and Birmingham City University.  Trainees are required to undertake 3 assignments across the year. These will be coordinated by Birmingham City University.\r\n\r\nAssessment on this course is carried out via a combination of lesson observation and written assignment.  On completion, trainees receive QTS and a PGCE qualification.","interviewProcess":"Interviews will take place at South Bromsgrove High Academy.
