Throughout your school experience, you will gain experience in two different key stages in order to meet the requirements of the qualification.  Your School Experience 1  (Spring 2022 Summer 2022 and Autumn 2022 Terms) and School Experience 2 (Spring / Summer 2023 terms) will be based at a second, contrasting school.  Your main school will be determined by the South Bromsgrove Teaching School Alliance in collaboration with the Primary Lead at St John's CofE Middle School and the University of Worcester. In placing trainees, we will take account of your location and specific training needs. We are keen to expand our partnership of schools, should trainees wish to train in specific schools, with whom they have existing links. All partnership schools are subject to Quality Assurance procedures, carried out by the University of Worcester.\r\n\r\nPart-time training courses operate across a three day week. Trainees will spend the majority of this time in school, but will spend one day a week in Professional Studies sessions. This will take place either at the University of Worcester or one of our alliance schools. These sessions cover all aspects of the Teacher Standards and draw on the extensive expertise from within the South Bromsgrove Teaching School Alliance. Through our programme, you will be able to visit a range of different schools and institutions and network with staff and trainees from across our network. We take a huge amount of pride in our Professional Studies as we ensure that the course not only prepares trainees for the demands of the training year (including teaching practice and assignments), but also prepares trainees for a career in primary education. \r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"Successful candidates will display a range of professional and personal characteristics including:\r\n*The ability to work effectively as part of a team and a commitment to collaborative practice\r\n*The ability to critically reflect on developing professional practice\r\n*The ability to engage in high level professional discourse regarding the theory and practice of teaching and learning\r\n*Excellent levels of oral, written and presentational communication skills\r\n*The ability to engage, motivate and inspire the hearts and minds of young learners\r\n*Perseverance, resilience and autonomy as a learner\r\n*A dedication to research-informed teaching\r\n","otherRequirements":"You will also be subject to the usual prohibition list and criminal record checks.
