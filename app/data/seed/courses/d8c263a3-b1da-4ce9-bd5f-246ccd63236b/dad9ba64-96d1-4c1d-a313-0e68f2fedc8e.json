Our partnership offers a strong colleagiate and supportive environment within which trainees thrive.  We offer a dedicated training space, excellent facilities and expert mentoring and coaching.  Our Professional Studies programme offers an ambitious curriculum aligned with the DfE Core Content Framework for Initial Teacher Training.  \r\n\r\nOur aim is to:\r\n\r\n*Encourage entrants to the profession who are motivated to pursue teaching as a career;\r\n*Develop teachers who are highly reflective, and curious about their own practice, the wider professional role of teachers and their impact on student learning and welfare;\r\n*Develop teachers who are committed to ongoing professional learning and have a sound bedrock of professional learning on which they can build;\r\n*Encourage teachers to value and contribute to a highly supportive, collaborative and collegiate culture in schools.\r\n\r\nThis course prepares trainees to teach Religious Education (RE) within secondary schools, from Key Stage 3 to Key Stage 5. The course involves a combination of practical teaching experience and taught modules on pedagogy and broader aspects of education. Trainees will be placed at South Bromsgrove High Academy for the main placement and will undertake a second contrasting school experience placement at another school.  Second school placements will be arranged during the first term and will be carefully matched to the needs of the trainee.\r\n\r\nThe professional studies element of the course will be coordinated by South Bromsgrove High Academy on a particular day each week. The unique aspect of this programme is that the delivery will be shared across schools in a wider alliance, who have specific areas of expertise. This will also allow insight into First, Middle, High and Special Schools. Much of the Professional Studies element will involve linking theory to classroom practice and will involve input from a variety of teachers, school leaders and Specialist Leaders in Education.\r\n \r\nThe subject based elements of the programme will be delivered in collaboration with University of Worcester, School of Education.  Trainees are required to undertake 2 assignments across the year. These will be coordinated by Worcester University.\r\n\r\nAssessment on this course is carried out via a combination of lesson observation and written assignment.  On completion, trainees receive QTS and a PGCE qualification.","interviewProcess":"Candidates will attend two interviews. The first interviews will take place at South Bromsgrove High Academy.
