These days are an opportunity to work with primary and secondary trainees and the sessions will form an integral part of the work you do in school. You will be part of a large cohort of beginning teachers exploring the school curriculum and how to make it accessible and enjoyable to all pupils.\r\n\r\nYou will have a mentor assigned by the school.  You will also be allocated a university tutor who will work closely with you and your mentor. From the beginning of the course, which starts at the end of August, you will be regarded as a member of staff but also as a beginning teacher. You will attend development days, consultation sessions and extra-curricular activities. \r\n\r\nIn the second term you will undertake a placement in a second school. This is an opportunity to learn within a different context and share your experiences with other trainees.\r\n\r\nThe practical experience is underpinned by theoretical approaches that are discussed and explored during University based sessions. There is a focus on both ‘Schools and Society’ and ‘Teaching and Learning’ and your assignments will ensure that these aspects are closely considered in relation to your teaching in school.  \r\n\r\nThe School Direct PGCE course is assessed at postgraduate certificate level.  It incorporates two 30-credit modules which may be counted towards the MA in Education.\r\n\r\nFor the award of the PGCE and to achieve QTS, you must have reached the required standard in both the theoretical and practical elements of the course.  There are no written examinations.\r\n\r\nPractical Teaching is assessed by the University tutors, school based mentors and coordinators, and External Examiners.  Account is taken of your work over all school based elements of the course and your own written records of such work.\r\n\r\nThe University does not allow an automatic right to re-sit practical teaching if you fail this part of the course. If the right to re-sit is granted then the opportunity is dependent upon locating a partner school which agrees to place you.\r\n\r\nOn the course, you are required to submit various pieces of work related to your course.  The assignments may be written pieces or presentations and may include collaborative work.\r\n","interviewProcess":"When you come for a School Direct interview, there are likely to be other applicants being interviewed alongside you.

Equate and the University of Nottingham.  You may be asked to carry out certain tasks that allow you to demonstrate your knowledge and skills, individually or in groups. \r\n\r\nWe then interview you in school.
