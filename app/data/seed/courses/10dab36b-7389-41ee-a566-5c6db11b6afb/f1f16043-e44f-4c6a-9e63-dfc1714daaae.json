You will also be appointed a mentor with whom you will meet at least once a week.  The mentor and class teacher are often the same person.\r\n\r\nThe course is full time with weekly training sessions and workshops \r\ncovering all aspects of teaching the primary curriculum, which compliments the in-school training experience provided.  The training sessions will be led by expert practitioners who will support you to develop your knowledge, skills and understanding of  teaching and learning effectively in a primary school. \r\n\r\nAs part of the programme trainees working in special schools will have placements in two contrasting educational settings.  Trainees will spend two terms in a special school setting and one term in a mainstream school.  Trainees must be able to demonstrate they can teach across the age range and the National Curriculum in both settings. \r\n\r\nSubject to COVID-19 Government Regulations:-\r\nTrainees following the mainstream programme will have placements in two contrasting educational settings.

The Pilgrim Partnership, working with The Cambridge Partnership as the accredited provider, recommends trainees, on successful completion of their training programme for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).
