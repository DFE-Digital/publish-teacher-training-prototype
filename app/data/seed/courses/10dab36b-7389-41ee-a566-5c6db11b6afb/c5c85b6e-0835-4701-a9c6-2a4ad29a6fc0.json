The training sessions will be led by expert practitioners, some of whom work in our excellent partner schools.  They will support you to develop your knowledge, skills and understanding of teaching lessons effectively in a secondary school across all key stages, where applicable.\r\n\r\nAs part of the programme trainees will complete a contrasting school placement and attend focus days to enhance your expertise and understanding of SEND and other specialist areas of education.\r\n\r\nA programme of continuous formative assessment of trainees' subject knowledge and ability to teach, as recorded within the portfolio, culminates in a rigorous assessment of the Teachers' Standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) as specified by the Department for Education (DfE). As an accredited provider, SAF ITT recommends trainees, on successful completion of their training programme for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).\r\n\r\nTrainees will also be able to study for a PGCE alongside the QTS.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Candidates who meet the entry requirements will be invited to interview.\r\n\r\nDue to the current restrictions regarding Covid-19, the interview will take place online via TEAMS and involve staff from SAF ITT.\r\n\r\nFurther information will be forwarded to candidates invited to interview to enable them to prepare for the interview.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Trainees will have two school placements in addition to other placement visits during the programme and will be supported by mentors and the SAF ITT team.
