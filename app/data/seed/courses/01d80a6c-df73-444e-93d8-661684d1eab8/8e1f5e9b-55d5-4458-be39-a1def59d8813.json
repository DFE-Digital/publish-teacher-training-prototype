You will be well prepared to teach across the full primary range, but will receive additional innovative content which aims to develop and deepen your subject knowledge of teaching mathematics for primary pupils. We also offer Primary (3-7) (2TXN), and Primary (5-11)  (2BKV). The training is entirely practitioner-led, designed and run by excellent schools and teachers from within our wide partnership. By training with us, new teachers are learning about the profession entirely from current practitioners who are keen to share their expertise. Our partnership proudly sees this route as a recruitment pipeline of excellent new teachers for our schools and takes care to ensure the training is as up-to-date and relevant as possible.  More time is spent in school compared to conventional PGCE programmes.  You are supported in a personalised way to develop your confidence over the year and by the Summer Term, you will be teaching 70% or more, ready for your teaching post in September! \r\n\r\nWe provide you with:\r\n\r\n* Excellent innovative, research-informed teaching \r\n* 60 Master's credits \r\n* A placement in Key Stage 1 and another in Key Stage 2 in a contrasting school\r\n* Enrichment experiences in other settings\r\n* Personalised levels of  support from University and School-based tutors \r\n* Shorter training days to allow for a work-life balance\r\n* Support for your NQT year\r\n\r\nOur programme has been written by Headteachers in response to their requirements for NQTs. We cover important areas early on, such as SEND and Behaviour Management. Training is interwoven with school experience, allowing you to embed theory into your practice. We ensure trainees have the skillsets desirable to our  schools, as described by one of our Federation Heads: \"We recently interviewed several trainees from a range of providers for an Early Year's post. The quality of the trainees from Exeter Consortium, in terms of depth of knowledge, practical experiences and their ability to articulate their learning was outstanding.  All in all, it was clear that the course is significantly strong in preparing teachers for entry into the profession.\" \r\n\r\nYou will complete three assignments for the PGCE with Bath Spa University, rated Outstanding for ITT, who visit us in Exeter. Bath Spa provide regular tutorials. \r\n\r\nBuilt into our programme is a focus on well being; our cohort is purposefully small, and we offer personalised support throughout the year.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Under guidance from the DfE, we continued to recruit safely throughout the  Covid 19 pandemic using online platforms. In order to limit numbers of visitors to our partner schools and in the interests of keeping everyone safe, we will continue to interview over Zoom. If you would like a face-to-face meeting prior to your interview, we are able to meet in a Covid-safe way on request. \r\n\r\nOnce shortlisted, you will be invited to an online interview that will involve:\r\n\r\n* a short presentation of a planned lesson   \r\n* a written task \r\n* a panel interview \r\n* a reflection task \r\n* opportunities to talk with a current trainee via telephone \r\n\r\nSuccessful candidates are  greeted with a Welcome Pack which helps them through the preparations required to start the course along with useful support materials to help them make the most of their training year.

","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will be placed in a 'home' school for the whole of the Autumn and Summer Terms, and a contrasting school for the Spring Term where you will teach within the opposite key stage. We also provide you with three days of adjacent keystage experience where you will spend time (without teaching) in EYFS and a secondary setting. You have a school mentor as well as a visiting tutor to quality assure your placement. \r\n\r\nWe make every effort to place trainees within schools that are accessible for them and which meet their needs. We can offer experience and placements in schools which have specialist SEN provision as well as experience within the hospital setting. We cannot guarantee that your placement will be within a particular school, but our partnership allows for a wide range of suitable placements in order to offer you the best training experience possible.  \r\n\r\nTrainees come together as a cohort for the taught elements of the course each week. The practical, school based learning dovetails into the academic course.  The Consortium and its schools have an enviable track record in CPD and staff development and value the opportunity to prepare the next generation of outstanding teachers for their schools. Some of the training is delivered at West Exe School  and some training is delivered by SLEs in their own schools, allowing you to visit many schools  over the year and see a diverse range of settings. Each term you will have a block practice where you are in school for whole weeks, allowing you to fully focus on your teaching. \r\n\r\nWe aim to provide the best possible educational outcomes for all our children.  Our trainers and mentors are excellent practitioners, many of whom are Senior Leaders in Education (SLEs) in our Consortium schools, keen to share their expertise with future colleagues.  Being trained by these key staff from schools across the city, gives you links and allows you to network with your future colleagues.  The outstanding success of our teacher training in Exeter is clear affirmation of the vision and hard work of our partner schools!\r\n","personalQualities":"We welcome candidates who have what  it takes to become  outstanding teachers.
