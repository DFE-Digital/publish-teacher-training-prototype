You will be well prepared to teach across the full primary range. We also offer Primary 3-7 (2TXN). The training is entirely practitioner-led, designed and run by excellent schools and teachers from within our wide partnership. By training with us, new teachers are learning about the profession entirely from current practitioners who are keen to share their expertise. Our partnership proudly sees this route as a recruitment pipeline of excellent new teachers for our schools and so takes care to ensure our training is as up-to-date and relevant as possible.  You will spend much more time in school compared to conventional PGCE programmes.  Your confidence is built gradually and in a personalised way; you are supported to develop your confidence over the year so that by the end of the Summer Term, you will be teaching 70% or more, in readiness for your teaching post in September! \r\n\r\nWe provide you with:\r\n\r\n* Excellent innovative, research-informed teaching \r\n* 60 Master's credits \r\n* A placement in Key Stage 1 and another in Key Stage 2 in a contrasting school\r\n* Enrichment experiences in other settings\r\n* Personalised levels of  support from University and School-based tutors \r\n* Shorter training days to allow for a work-life balance\r\n* Support for your Early Career Teacher (ECT) year\r\n\r\nOur programme has been written by Headteachers in response to their requirements for ECTs. We cover important areas early on in the year, such as Special Educational Needs and Behaviour Management. Training is interwoven with your school experience, allowing you to embed theory into your practice. We ensure trainees have the skillsets desirable to our  schools, as described by one of our Federation Heads: \"We recently interviewed several trainees from a range of providers for an Early Year's post. The quality of the trainees from Exeter Consortium, in terms of depth of knowledge, practical experiences and their ability to articulate their learning was outstanding.  All in all, it was clear that the course is significantly strong in preparing teachers for entry into the profession.\" \r\n\r\nYou will complete three assignments for the PGCE with Bath Spa University, rated Outstanding for ITT, who visit us in Exeter. Bath Spa provide regular tutorials. \r\n\r\nBuilt into our programme is a focus on well being; our cohort is purposefully small, so we can offer personalised support throughout the year.\r\n","interviewProcess":"We carry out our interviews virtually to allow for a flexible process for all.

We also provide you with three days of adjacent key stage experience. You have a school mentor as well as a visiting tutor to quality assure your placement. \r\n\r\nWe make every effort to place trainees within schools that are accessible for them and which meet their needs. We can offer experience and placements in schools which have specialist SEN provision as well as experience within the hospital setting. We cannot guarantee that your placement will be within a particular school, but our partnership allows for a wide range of suitable placements in order to offer you the best training experience possible.  \r\n\r\nTrainees come together as a cohort for the taught elements of the course each week. The practical, school based learning dovetails into the academic course.  The Consortium and its schools have an enviable track record in CPD and staff development and value the opportunity to prepare the next generation of outstanding teachers for their schools. Some of the training is delivered at West Exe School  and some training is delivered by Specialist Leaders in Education (SLEs) in their own schools, allowing you to visit many schools  over the year and see a diverse range of settings. Each term you will have a block practice where you are in school for whole weeks, allowing you to fully focus on your teaching. \r\n\r\nWe aim to provide the best possible educational outcomes for all our children.  Our trainers and mentors are excellent practitioners, many of whom are Senior Leaders in Education (SLEs) in our Consortium schools, keen to share their expertise with future colleagues.  Being trained by these key staff from schools across the city, gives you links and allows you to network with your future colleagues.  The outstanding success of our teacher training in Exeter is clear affirmation of the vision and hard work of our partner schools!\r\n","personalQualities":"We welcome candidates who have what  it takes to become  outstanding teachers.
