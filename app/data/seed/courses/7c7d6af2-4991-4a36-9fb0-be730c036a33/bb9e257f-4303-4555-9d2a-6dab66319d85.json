This is a practical course where you will be immersed in music making, teaching and encouraged to use and develop your musical skills. We teach you through practical sessions, and you’ll consider topics such as pop music, dance, gamelan, song writing and developing your subject knowledge. You’ll explore immersive ways to teach music and how to encourage pupils to engage with musical experiences. \r\n \r\nWe have a partnership with the Royal Northern College of Music (RNCM) and we hold regular study sessions there. At RNCM, you’ll usually have the opportunity to experience guest lectures and concerts.  To help you explore how trips can benefit your students, you’ll typically be encouraged to visit a variety of musical venues across Manchester. This includes theatre schools and music organisations with outreach programmes.\r\n\r\nWhen you’re at Manchester Met, you’ll mainly study with your PGCE Music group. They are one of your greatest learning resources. You’ll consider how to plan lessons, reflect on your planning, learn how research can develop your teaching practice, and look at ways to develop your teacher persona. You’ll also learn through peer-collaboration, sharing knowledge with your fellow music trainees.  You won’t simply learn theory with us on-campus though, you’ll teach classes in schools too. You’ll spend at least 120 days on placements in schools – gradually becoming the class teacher.\r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Upon receipt of a successful application we will call a candidate to interview.
