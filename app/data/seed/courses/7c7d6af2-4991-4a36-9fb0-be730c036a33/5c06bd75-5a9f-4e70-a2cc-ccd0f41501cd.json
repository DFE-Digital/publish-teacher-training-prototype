You’ll learn how to teach both English language and literature, covering subjects such as media, drama, and phonics.  You’ll look at a variety of short texts and poetry – perhaps Wilfred Owen’s poem Exposure or prose such as George Orwell’s Animal Farm – and you’ll focus on how you can turn literature into learning.\r\n\r\nDuring the course, you’ll explore ways to use literature to help improve student’s grasp of the spoken word, their writing skills and numeracy. And, you’ll typically have language lessons to help you develop your skills in areas such as grammar and phonics too. You’ll usually go on a trip to a local art gallery to reflect on art as a stimulus for writing, and have guest lectures from practising English teachers and people working for exam boards. When you’re at Manchester Met, you’ll mainly study with your PGCE English group. You’ll consider how to plan lessons, reflect on your planning, learn how research can develop your teaching practice, and look at ways to develop your teacher persona. You will not simply learn theory with us on-campus though, you’ll teach classes in schools too. \r\n\r\nYou will spend at least 120 days on placements in schools, gradually increasing your involvement to become the class teacher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Upon receipt of a successful application we will call a candidate to interview.
