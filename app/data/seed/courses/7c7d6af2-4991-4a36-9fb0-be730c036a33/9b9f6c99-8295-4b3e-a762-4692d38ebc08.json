You will learn how to teach your main language, Spanish, to A/AS level but you’ll also study a second language too, for example, French, German or Mandarin. This gives you the opportunity to teach your second language up to Key Stage 3 or GCSE level (this depends on your linguistic ability and qualifications).\r\n\r\nAt Manchester Met, you’ll mainly study with your PGCE Spanish group. You will usually have classes in the language you’ll teach, to help you learn teaching methods.  You will consider how to plan lessons, reflect on your planning, learn how research can develop your teaching practice, and look at ways to develop your teacher persona.  You won’t simply learn theory though – you’ll spend at least 120 days on placements in schools.  On your placements, you’ll normally have the opportunity to teach other languages you speak. Past students have taught their heritage languages, including Farsi, Japanese and Arabic.\r\n\r\nWe also work with schools who offer Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL). This allows you to teach another subject in a foreign language, such as teaching science or maths in Spanish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Upon receipt of a successful application we will call a candidate to interview.

We work on an AB model where trainees will be placed in two contrasting schools. Placement A runs from September to January and Placement B from January to June. This provides the trainee with two different experiences and therefore expands the skills gained during the course. \r\nWhen on placement in school the trainee will have a trained Subject Mentor who will support them through weekly meetings and observations. They will also have a Professional Mentor who is responsible for their professional development on a whole school level. Trainees will be given a varied timetable of different Key Stages and abilities and will build up the number of lessons they teach gradually throughout each placement. ","personalQualities":"We are looking for individuals with a genuine passion for working with young people from a variety of backgrounds with varying abilities. Candidates will need to be determined, reflective and resilient and dedicated to the betterment of the young people in their care.
