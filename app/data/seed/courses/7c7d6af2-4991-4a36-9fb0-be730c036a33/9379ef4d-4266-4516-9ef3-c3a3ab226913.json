You’ll learn teaching methods through interactive workshops – we teach you as if you’re in a school art class.  This helps you to experience what it’s like to learn the same way as students, and explore the different ways you could teach art activities.  You’ll have sessions across art, craft and design, from drawing to printmaking, ceramics to lens based media (such as photography).  For specialist mediums, such as ceramics and paper craft, we usually organise a series of guest lectures, inviting artists with expertise in these practices to teach you.  You will also share your specialist art and design skills with your group too (students from past years have shared skills including bookbinding and Photoshop).\r\n\r\nWhen you’re at Manchester Met, you’ll mainly study with your art and design group. You’ll consider how to plan lessons, reflect on your planning, learn how research can develop your teaching practice, and look at ways to develop your teacher persona. You won’t simply learn theory with us on-campus though, you’ll teach classes in schools too. You’ll spend at least 120 days on placements in schools – gradually becoming the class teacher.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Upon receipt of a successful application we will call a candidate to interview.

They will also have a Professional Mentor who is responsible for their professional development on a whole school level. Trainees will be given a varied timetable of different Key Stages and abilities and will build up the number of lessons they teach gradually throughout each placement.
