You’ll explore inclusive ways to teach history, and develop your ability to teach different historical concepts such as causation, interpretation, change and continuity. Some of the key topics you’ll consider include how to use sources, the importance of the medium of language when teaching history, differentiation in the history classroom, and gender and ethnicity in the teaching and learning of history. You will typically have a series of guest lectures, by speakers from The National Archives and Historic England to local teachers, to help you explore ways to teach history.  Usually, you’ll go on trips to history museums in the local area, as well as a history tour of Manchester. These activities give you the opportunity to focus on the preparations teachers do before a class trip, and the experience your students will gain outside of the classroom.\r\n\r\nWhen you’re at Manchester Met, you’ll mainly study with your PGCE History group. You’ll consider how to plan lessons, reflect on your planning, learn how research can develop your teaching practice, and look at ways to develop your teacher persona. You’ll also learn through peer-collaboration, sharing knowledge with your fellow history trainees.\r\n\r\nYou won’t simply explore ways to teach your class about World War One or migration and the British Empire. You’ll spend at least 120 days on placements in schools, gradually increasing your involvement to become the class teacher.\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Upon receipt of a successful application we will call a candidate to interview.
