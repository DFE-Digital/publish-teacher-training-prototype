You’ll explore how to teach students computing and digital skills through hands-on activities such as programming and practical projects using Raspberry Pis or robots.  On this course, you’ll mainly study with your group. You’ll consider how to plan lessons, reflect on your planning, learn how research can develop your teaching practice, and look at ways to develop your teacher persona.\r\n\r\nSome of the topics you’ll learn include algorithms, data structures, keeping safe online and programming languages used in secondary schools (such as Python and Visual Basic). You’ll complete sample projects set for GCSE and A-level students too, so that you understand the tasks the students will be doing. You’ll also have guest lectures from people working in industry, Computing At School (part of the British Computer Society (BCS), The Chartered Institute for IT) and exam boards. After learning ways to teach coding or how to assess a pupil’s use of HTML to create a web page, you’ll teach these skills in schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Upon receipt of a successful application we will call a candidate to interview.
