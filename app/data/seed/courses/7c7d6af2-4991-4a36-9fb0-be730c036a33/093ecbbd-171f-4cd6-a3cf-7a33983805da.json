You will learn strategies to help you teach a variety of topics in mathematics classes, including number, geometry and algebra. You will also explore practical activities that you can use in or outside the classroom that encourage students to engage in mastering mathematics. We know it can be daunting to teach a class, so during the first few weeks of this PGCE you’ll typically plan short lessons based on a script and present them to fellow trainees. This helps you to become comfortable presenting in front of a group and to explore methods of lesson planning.\r\n\r\nWhen you’re at Manchester Met, you’ll mainly study with your PGCE Mathematics group. You will consider how to plan lessons, reflect on your planning, learn how research can develop your teaching practice, and look at ways to develop your teacher persona. You won’t simply explore methods to teach your class fractions or data handling though – you’ll spend at least 120 days on placements in schools.  For some of your placements, you might be part of a small group, planning lessons collaboratively and team teaching to share and develop your mathematics skills.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Upon receipt of a successful application we will call a candidate to interview.

We work on an AB model where trainees will be placed in two contrasting schools. Placement A runs from September to January and Placement B from January to June. This provides the trainee with two different experiences and therefore expands the skills gained during the course. \r\nWhen on placement in school the trainee will have a trained Subject Mentor who will support them through weekly meetings and observations. They will also have a Professional Mentor who is responsible for their professional development on a whole school level. Trainees will be given a varied timetable of different Key Stages and abilities and will build up the number of lessons they teach gradually throughout each placement. ","personalQualities":"We are looking for individuals with a genuine passion for working with young people from a variety of backgrounds with varying abilities. Candidates will need to be determined, reflective and resilient and dedicated to the betterment of the young people in their care.
