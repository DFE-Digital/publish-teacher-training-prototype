You will be given the opportunity to teach across the social sciences at different key stages. The opportunities range from Sociology and Psychology to Child development. \r\n\r\nWhen you’re at Manchester Met, you’ll mainly study with your School Direct social science group. You’ll consider how to plan lessons, reflect on your planning, learn how research can develop your teaching practice, and look at ways to develop your teacher persona. You will also reflect on topics that sit across the curriculum in schools, such as pastoral care, Personal, Social, Health and Economic Education (PSHE), and Citizenship. This helps you to develop subject knowledge that you can use in your future teaching career.  You won’t simply learn teaching methods with us on-campus though – you’ll teach classes in schools too. \r\n\r\nYou will spend at least 120 days on placements in schools, gradually  increasing your involvement to become  the class teacher.\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Upon receipt of a successful application we will call a candidate to interview.
