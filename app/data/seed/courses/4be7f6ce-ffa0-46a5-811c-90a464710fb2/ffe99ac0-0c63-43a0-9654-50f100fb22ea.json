There are four assignments, two in each Level 7 module, which are spread over the year. \r\n\r\nThe School Experience Library is an excellent resource offered to students to enhance their use of research and resources to inform practice in the classroom.\r\n\r\nAll students have access to purpose-built teaching and learning resources on the new Waterside Campus allowing them to develop their professional abilities. Facilities include fully equipped rooms; teaching and learning involves using technology, high quality teaching resources, workshops and group work relevant to the variety of educational settings in which students will be working.\r\n\r\nThe University of Northampton is rated as Gold in the Teaching Excellence Framework. ","interviewProcess":"Applicants selected for interview will take part in a two-step process for the School Direct course.  This is subject to change, to keep up with Covid precautions.\r\n\r\nYou will meet with the both Professional Tutor for the Hatton Centre of Education and a primary school leader at one of our Primary Schools. They will then carry out a range of activities including a micro-teaching experience, a literacy task, a panel interview and will give a presentation considering their motivation to become a teacher.\r\n\r\nApplicants will then proceed to an individual interview with a member of university staff and a teacher from a partnership school.  This will explore an applicant's commitment to teaching, prior experiences and awareness of current educational contexts.\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of The University of Northampton that candidates should not be prejudiced as a result of any disability and reasonable adjustments will be made to mitigate unfair discrimination. Therefore, all candidates with disabilities are encouraged to identify and/or request support for actual or potential circumstances.\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The University of Northampton works in partnership with over 150 schools. The PGCE programme includes three school experiences and one self organised experience. The normal pattern is referred to as ABA where the autumn term and summer term are based in school A in the same class and the spring term in school B in the alternative key stage. The self organised experience normally takes place in the spring term. The age ranges are 3-7 or 5-11. \r\n\r\nAt the Hatton Centre of Education, we try our hardest to find schools that are convenient for you and that will offer you a range of experiences.  This is always in dialogue with yourselves.  We only offer a few places, so we work closely with student teachers to ensure they are best supported to fulfil their potential as outstanding teachers.","personalQualities":"To be considered for entry for the PGCE, prospective candidates must have the necessary personal attributes, meet the entry requirements required by the Teacher Regulation Agency for schools, provide suitable references to support their academic qualifications and/or their prior experiences.\r\nPersonal attributes include commitment to working with children and making a difference to their progress, organisation and time management skills, ability to work with others and respond to advice, and use of standard spoken English.\r\n","otherRequirements":"You must be interviewed, and we will explore your suitability for teaching including undertaking DBS and Disqualification by Association and Prohibition checks.\r\n\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:47:12.816Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-13T09:40:12.370Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2023"}
