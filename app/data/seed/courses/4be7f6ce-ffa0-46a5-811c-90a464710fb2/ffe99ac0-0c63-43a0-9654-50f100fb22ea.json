Therefore, all candidates with disabilities are encouraged to identify and/or request support for actual or potential circumstances.\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The University of Northampton works in partnership with over 150 schools. The PGCE programme includes three school experiences and one self organised experience. The normal pattern is referred to as ABA where the autumn term and summer term are based in school A in the same class and the spring term in school B in the alternative key stage. The self organised experience normally takes place in the spring term. The age ranges are 3-7 or 5-11. \r\n\r\nAt the Hatton Centre of Education, we try our hardest to find schools that are convenient for you and that will offer you a range of experiences.  This is always in dialogue with yourselves.  We only offer a few places, so we work closely with student teachers to ensure they are best supported to fulfil their potential as outstanding teachers.","personalQualities":"To be considered for entry for the PGCE, prospective candidates must have the necessary personal attributes, meet the entry requirements required by the Teacher Regulation Agency for schools, provide suitable references to support their academic qualifications and/or their prior experiences.\r\nPersonal attributes include commitment to working with children and making a difference to their progress, organisation and time management skills, ability to work with others and respond to advice, and use of standard spoken English.\r\n","otherRequirements":"You must be interviewed, and we will explore your suitability for teaching including undertaking DBS and Disqualification by Association and Prohibition checks.\r\n\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:47:12.816Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-13T09:40:12.370Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2024"}
