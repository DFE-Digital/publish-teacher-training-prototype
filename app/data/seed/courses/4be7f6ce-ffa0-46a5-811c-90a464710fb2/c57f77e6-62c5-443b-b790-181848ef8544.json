It encompasses the study of number, algebra, ratio, proportion and rates of change, geometry and measures, probability and statistics. These are all important elements of the mathematics curriculum and at Leicester we strive to ensure you become an effective practitioner of mathematics education with the ability to excite and engage pupils.\r\n\r\nYou will learn from some of the best practitioners in the field and, with their support, learn how to become an effective practitioner. The programme will cover all areas of the National Curriculum for Mathematics, and will also address national testing, extra curricular learning opportunities and your own professional development.\r\n\r\nPCGE Secondary Mathematics aims to:\r\n * Broaden and deepen your knowledge and understanding of mathematics for teaching purposes;\r\n* Develop your understanding and insight into the ways in which mathematics is learned and potential difficulties;\r\n* Provide an informed and critical view of National Curriculum requirements;\r\n* Provide up-to-date knowledge and experience of curriculum materials, developments in assessment and examinations, and the potential of technology;\r\n* Provide a broad range of teaching and learning methods to cater for a full range of pupils; and\r\n* Develop your skills in planning, communication, assessment, recording and evaluation.\r\n\r\nThe mathematics subject specialism will cover a variety of areas including:\r\n* The mathematics curriculum;\r\n* Lesson planning;\r\n* Subject knowledge: approaches to teaching and learning, including common misconceptions;\r\n* Teaching mathematics using technology;\r\n* Communicating mathematically;\r\n* Differentiating to enable all pupils to reach their potential;\r\n* Teaching approaches to support problem solving; and\r\n* Maths outside the classroom.\r\n\r\nContinuous assessment is used throughout the course and there are no examinations.\r\n\r\nApplications are welcome from applicants with good qualifications in their mathematics qualifications at GCSE and AS/A level (or equivalent) and at honours degree level.\r\n\r\nThose applicants with joint or combined honours degrees in which Mathematics is a major subject are also welcome to apply.\r\n\r\nApplicants with degrees in a range of academic backgrounds including engineering, economics and physics have previously made successful applications.\r\n\r\nApplicants without mathematics as a substantial part of their degree may, in some circumstances, be able to undertake a Subject Knowledge Enhancement course in lieu of the honours level mathematics.","interviewProcess":"If invited for interview, you will take part in a two-step process.  Firstly, you will meet with the Professional Tutor for the Hatton Centre of Education and will carry out a range of activities including a micro-teaching experience, a literacy task, a panel interview and you will give a presentation considering your motivation to become a teacher. This is subject to change, to keep up with Covid precautions.\r\n\r\nIf successful in this first step you will then meet members of the university course team who will give an overview of the course and answer any questions you may have.\r\n\r\nYou will participate in a group task with candidates from a range of subjects and give a brief presentation as part of a small group.\r\nSubject tutors will introduce a written subject task that you will complete during the day and you will have an individual interview with a subject tutor. The interview is not a daunting process but rather a discussion about your suitability and preparation for going into teaching. During the interview, you will explore any additional preparation needed to help put you in the best possible position to engage successfully with the course from the start.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will undertake two secondary teaching placements in our Partnership Schools. We try to place students in contrasting schools to ensure you have a rich and varied experience in your initial training year and that you have the opportunity to teach across the 11-18 age range.\r\nThe placements are referred to as 'Phase A' and 'Phase B' placements.\r\n\r\nIn planning your placements, your subject tutor will try to balance the distance you are asked to travel with your individual needs and our knowledge of our wide range of school partners.\r\n\r\nPhase A:\r\nAfter induction you will spend 8 weeks in your Phase A placement school. You will build on existing experience and develop new skills with support from the school's Coordinator for Initial Teacher Education and a subject mentor who will oversee your professional development during the placement and liaise closely with your university tutor who will also support you. During this placement you will be expected to fulfil a 50% timetable.\r\n\r\nPhase B:\r\nDuring your second placement you will spend about 14 weeks in a different school, also supported by a mentor, ITE Coordinator and university tutor. During this placement you will be expected to fulfil a 66% timetable.\r\n\r\nAll students will also undertake a week in a primary school following their Phase A placement to support their understanding of the broader context of education and to support writing of one of the PGCE assignments.\r\n","personalQualities":"You should be able to demonstrate genuine interest and enthusiasm for Mathematics at interview.\r\n\r\nWe recommend that all prospective students have spent some days observing, possibly assisting, learners and teachers in Mathematics departments / classrooms to familiarise themselves with current developments.\r\n\r\nThe PGCE is a challenging course, and we are looking for applicants with a wide range of skills, knowledge, experiences and an aptitude for teaching. These skills include the ability to form relationships, good communication, commitment to learning and teaching and reflective qualities.\r\n","otherRequirements":"Admission to the course is subject to a satisfactory medical report. The University will provide more information about this should you be offered a place.\r\nAll offers are subject to a satisfactory enhanced DBS disclosure. We will provide instructions regarding the DBS application process once you have accepted an offer of a place on the course.\r\n\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:47:12.466Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-13T09:34:49.930Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2024"}
