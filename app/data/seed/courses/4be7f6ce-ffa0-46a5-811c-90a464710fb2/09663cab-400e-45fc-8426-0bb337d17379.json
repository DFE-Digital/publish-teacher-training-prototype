It is an exciting and relevant subject which plays a major role in helping children to develop a better understanding of the increasingly complex world around them.\r\n\r\nPGCE Secondary Geography aims to:\r\n * Broaden and deepen your knowledge and understanding of Geography for teaching purposes\r\n * Provide you with an informed and critical view of National Curriculum, GCSE, A level and relevant vocational requirements\r\n * Raise awareness and provide experience of a broad range of learning and teaching strategies\r\n * Develop your skills in classroom management, planning, communication, assessment, recording and evaluation\r\n * Understand the differing needs of those with learning difficulties and very able students\r\n * Raise your awareness of a wide range of assessment strategies\r\n\r\nThe Geography subject specialism will run throughout the academic year and will cover a variety of areas including:\r\n * Planning and curriculum in Geography\r\n * Approaches to student learning\r\n * Thinking skills\r\n * Enquiry based learning\r\n * Fieldwork\r\n * Creative approaches to learning\r\n\r\nGeography students will form part of a Humanities subject group along with History, RE and Social Science for generic sessions. There will also be a programme of Geography subject enhancement sessions. This approach recognises the need for flexibility and adaptability required of the Humanities based teacher.\r\n\r\nContinuous assessment is used throughout the course. There are no examinations.\r\n\r\nApplications are welcome from students with good/very good qualifications in their Geography qualifications at GCSE and AS/A level (or equivalent) and at honours degree level.\r\n\r\nApplications are also welcome from students with a Joint or Combined Honours degree in which Geography is one of the major subjects.\r\nStudents with related degrees such as Geology or Environmental Studies may also apply.\r\n\r\nA good A level Geography qualification would be viewed very positively.\r\n","interviewProcess":"If invited for interview, you will take part in a two-step process.  Firstly, you will meet with the Professional Tutor for the Hatton Centre of Education and will carry out a range of activities including a micro-teaching experience, a literacy task, a panel interview and you will give a presentation considering your motivation to become a teacher. This is subject to change, to keep up with Covid precautions.\r\n\r\nIf successful in this first step you will then meet members of the university course team who will give an overview of the course and answer any questions you may have.\r\n\r\nYou will participate in a group task with candidates from a range of subjects and give a brief presentation as part of a small group.\r\nSubject tutors will introduce a written subject task that you will complete during the day and you will have an individual interview with a subject tutor. The interview is not a daunting process but rather a discussion about your suitability and preparation for going into teaching. During the interview, you will explore any additional preparation needed to help put you in the best possible position to engage successfully with the course from the start.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will undertake two secondary teaching placements in our Partnership Schools. We try to place students in contrasting schools to ensure you have a rich and varied experience in your initial training year and that you have the opportunity to teach across the 11-18 age range.\r\nThe placements are referred to as 'Phase A' and 'Phase B' placements.\r\n\r\nIn planning your placements, your subject tutor will try to balance the distance you are asked to travel with your individual needs and our knowledge of our wide range of school partners.\r\n\r\nPhase A:\r\nAfter induction you will spend 8 weeks in your Phase A placement school. You will build on existing experience and develop new skills with support from the school's Coordinator for Initial Teacher Education and a subject mentor who will oversee your professional development during the placement and liaise closely with your university tutor who will also support you. During this placement you will be expected to fulfil a 50% timetable.\r\n\r\nPhase B:\r\nDuring your second placement you will spend about 14 weeks in a different school, also supported by a mentor, ITE Coordinator and university tutor. During this placement you will be expected to fulfil a 66% timetable.\r\n\r\nAll students will also undertake a week in a primary school following their Phase A placement to support their understanding of the broader context of education and to support writing of one of the PGCE assignments.\r\n","personalQualities":"You should be able to demonstrate genuine interest and enthusiasm for Geography at interview.\r\n\r\nWe recommend that all prospective students have spent some days observing, possibly assisting, learners and teachers in Humanities departments/ classrooms to familiarise themselves with current developments.\r\n\r\nThe PGCE is a challenging course, and we are looking for applicants with a wide range of skills, knowledge, experiences and an aptitude for teaching. These skills include the ability to form relationships, good communication, commitment to learning and teaching and reflective qualities.\r\n","otherRequirements":"Admission to the course is subject to a satisfactory medical report. The University will provide more information about this should you be offered a place.\r\nAll offers are subject to a satisfactory enhanced DBS disclosure. We will provide instructions regarding the DBS application process once you have accepted an offer of a place on the course.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:47:12.665Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-13T09:33:25.315Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2024"}
