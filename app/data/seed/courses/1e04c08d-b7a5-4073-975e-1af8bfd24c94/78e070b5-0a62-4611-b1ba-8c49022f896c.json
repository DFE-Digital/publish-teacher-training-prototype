You would have the opportunity to train with an organisation where \"Teachers have high expectations, and their enthusiasm and excellent subject knowledge inspires pupils\". The St John Bosco Primary training programme draws on expertise from a range of providers. We collaborate with other Teaching Schools to deliver joint training sessions, enabling you to learn from practicing professionals.\r\n\r\nWe have designed our School Direct PGCE course to maximise your experience in classrooms. You will be supported by an experienced school mentor who will oversee your development as a teacher. Your mentor will help you gain the skills and confidence needed to be an effective teacher. A key part of this development is to help you become a reflective practitioner, this is a quality you will need for the rest of your teaching career.\r\n\r\nWe link with a range of primary schools and add more partner schools every year depending on the location of trainees. Contact Jan Rudge at St John Bosco for more details.\r\n\r\nThe course is also well supported by tutors from Newman University. Lectures and tutorials at Newman will develop your subject and teaching knowledge, underpinned by educational theory.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Depending on the national or local Covid circumstances interviews will take place at St John Bosco Catholic Primary School or online. If it is in school the interview comprises two main elements. Firstly there is a mini lesson to a small group of students. This will be based on a book of your choice that you can engage students in, followed by an activity linked to the book.\r\nSecondly there is a formal interview with the coordinator of the primary programme for St John Bosco and a tutor from Newman University.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The trainees main training school is agreed following conversation with the Primary coordinator. This will be based on convenience as well as matching the trainee with the most appropriate support in a primary school. Second school placements are six week blocks, during the second term, and aim to give the trainee a contrasting experience. The trainee then returns to the main school until the end of the placement.","personalQualities":"In the first instance a passion to teach young children and make a difference to their lives. Also good knowledge and enthusiasm across a wide range of subjects.\r\nTo start a teacher training course we are not looking for a ready made teacher, but for someone who has the willingness to learn from professionals as well as being reflective and seeking continuous improvement.","otherRequirements":"Whilst recent school experience is not required to make an application it certainly enables you to make a more thoughtful and considered application by drawing on your time in a school, where you will have had opportunities to work with small groups of children and observe lessons.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:54:38.371Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-30T19:47:03.743Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2024"}
