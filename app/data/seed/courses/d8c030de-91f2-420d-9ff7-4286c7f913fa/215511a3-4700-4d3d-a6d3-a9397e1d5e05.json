Additionally, this includes distance placements such as Luton, The Isle of man and the opportunity to be placed from an alternative address e.g. Northern Ireland.  \r\n\r\nTrainees will be placed with children from 3 to 7 years and undertake three discreet assessed placements in a nursery, a Reception and a Key Stage 1 class. Early Years PGCE trainees will also undertake a placement in a setting which specialises in, or has a significant number of children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) during an Inclusion week to gain specific experience in this field.  \r\n\r\nPlacements vary in length from five days to fifty three days. The initial Nursery placement will provide trainees with the opportunity to undertake structured observations and reflect on the setting’s policies, practice and ethos. Trainees will familiarise themselves with routines and expectations alongside the Teachers’ Standards, in the context of the placement setting. This is a pass or fail assessment.\r\n\r\nThe two longer placements will be in Reception or Key Stage 1 and trainees will gradually increase their teaching and planning commitment up to 80% in the final placement, and this is a graded assessment against the Teachers’ Standards (DfE 2014). \r\n\r\nTrainees are allocated to placements based on a range of criteria including their geographical location, but also in relation to their training needs and requirements.\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"When you apply, you are expected to have:\r\n\r\n* A commitment to, and understanding of, early years education, demonstrating the personal attributes, values and motivation required to train as a teacher\r\n\r\n* Suitable presentational qualities, including a good standard of written English.","otherRequirements":"If you accept a formal offer from Edge Hill University you will be required to meet the Department for Education’s standards for physical and mental fitness to teach and clearance to work with children. \r\n\r\nFurther information, including a Declaration of Health questionnaire and details of how to apply for a [Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS)](https://www.edgehill.ac.uk/dbs) Enhanced Disclosure will be sent to you after you have firmly accepted an offer.
