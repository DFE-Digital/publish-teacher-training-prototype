Cheadle Hulme High School is the lead school in the Altius Alliance. All generic training involving the full cohort takes place here.\r\nThere are three assessed (11-16) teaching placements throughout the course. Trainees start the first placement in September and move to a new context in January for their second placement. They then, usually, return to the first placement school around March to complete the course.\r\n1.  As a small provider we endeavour to take account of participants’ locations and personal circumstances when arranging second placements. \r\n2. In summary, there are three assessed teaching placements (11-16) over two schools throughout the course and at least one of these takes place at a Laurus Trust school.\r\nIn addition to these placements the trainees spend some time in post 16 and primary environments to experience settings either side of the 11-16 age range. These are called enhancement placements and are not assessed.\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"‘Teaching is the most difficult profession of all. The only time a physician comes close to doing what a teacher does is when the doctor faces an emergency room of multiple patients with multiple conditions, all of whom need immediate attention. That’s what a teacher deals with every day in a class of 30.’\r\nLee Shulman\r\nAdapted from Educational Leadership, Vol 67 (5), February 2010\r\n\r\nYou need a high standard of personal organisation, a willingness to learn, a passion for your subject and, above all, a desire to work with young people to help them achieve their potential. \r\n","otherRequirements":"Before trainee teachers start their training, they must have\r\n\r\n• been screened by the Disclosure and Barring Service to make sure they are not barred from working with children and vulnerable adults\r\n\r\n• been assessed as having the health and physical capacity to teach so that children and young people in their care would not be at risk of harm\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:54:31.291Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-12T08:19:52.664Z","cycle":"2023","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"}
