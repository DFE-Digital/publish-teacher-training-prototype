We have a philosophy of “Speak First” and all students are immersed in the target language from their very first lesson. This style of language teaching, where target language is used, not only by teachers but also by students, allows learners to build on grammatical concepts to allow them to make clear links between areas of learning. A belief that “Oracy precedes literacy” underpins our pedagogical approach. There is a full calendar of enrichment activities, clubs, events and trips that run throughout the year.\r\n\r\nThe course runs from September to the end of June.\r\nAll of the time is spent in schools (apart from 4 days at university to undertake the Post Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) (SCITT).\r\nThe course comprises:\r\n•\tGeneric teacher training\r\n•\tMFL pedagogy programme \r\n•\tSEND with mental health programme\r\n•\tThree assessed teaching placements (11-16)\r\n•\tEnhancement placements – SEND school, Post 16 and primary placement (unassessed)\r\n•\tEnrichment opportunities \r\n•\tPGCE (SCITT) with 60 Masters credits\r\n\r\nAssessment:\r\n\r\nQTS: This is an evidence based course where trainees are required to maintain and submit evidence of meeting the Teachers’ Standards (DfE),  school experience files, formal lesson observations, pedagogy tasks, specific generic and curriculum-based tasks. \r\nPGCE (SCITT): Two assignments (5000 words each) at Masters level. \r\n‘The SCITT has an excellent reputation for producing NQTs who are confident and competent teachers.’ (Ofsted 2017)\r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"The selection process will involve an initial application (two references are required to support this application).\r\n\r\nSuccessful candidates will be invited for interview. This interview will be carried out remotely by two members of the SCITT team.\r\n\r\nCandidates will be informed of the outcome of the interview via UCAS within 3 working days.\r\n\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"There are approximately 9 secondary schools in the Alliance across Stockport, Manchester and Tameside. Cheadle Hulme High School is the lead school in the Altius Alliance. All generic training involving the full cohort takes place here.\r\nThere are three assessed (11-16) teaching placements throughout the course. Trainees start the first placement in September and move to a new context in January for their second placement. They then, usually, return to the first placement school around March to complete the course.\r\n1.  As a small provider we endeavour to take account of participants’ locations and personal circumstances when arranging second placements. \r\n2. In summary, there are three assessed teaching placements (11-16) over two schools throughout the course and at least one of these takes place at a Laurus Trust school.\r\nIn addition to these placements the trainees spend some time in post 16 and primary environments to experience settings either side of the 11-16 age range. These are called enhancement placements and are not assessed.\r\n","personalQualities":"‘Teaching is the most difficult profession of all. The only time a physician comes close to doing what a teacher does is when the doctor faces an emergency room of multiple patients with multiple conditions, all of whom need immediate attention. That’s what a teacher deals with every day in a class of 30.’\r\nLee Shulman\r\nAdapted from Educational Leadership, Vol 67 (5), February 2010\r\n\r\nYou need a high standard of personal organisation, a willingness to learn, a passion for your subject and, above all, a desire to work with young people to help them achieve their potential. \r\n","otherRequirements":"Before trainee teachers start their training, they must have\r\n\r\n• been screened by the Disclosure and Barring Service to make sure they are not barred from working with children and vulnerable adults\r\n\r\n• been assessed as having the health and physical capacity to teach so that children and young people in their care would not be at risk of harm\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:54:31.115Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-12T08:17:49.847Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"}
