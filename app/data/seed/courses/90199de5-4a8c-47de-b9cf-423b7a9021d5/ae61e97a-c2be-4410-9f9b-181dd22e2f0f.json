This training enables trainees to understand and prepare for the demands of a primary school teacher (5-11) and develop a research-informed pedagogical practice that they continue to develop beyond the course. \r\n\r\nThe course runs from September to the end of June.\r\n \r\nAll of the time is spent in schools (apart from 4 days at Manchester Metropolitan University to undertake the Post Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) (SCITT).\r\n \r\nThe course comprises:\r\n \r\n• Generic teacher training\r\n• Primary pedagogy programme to reflect KS1 and KS2 programmes\r\n• SEND with mental health programme\r\n• Three assessed teaching placements over two schools\r\n• Enhancement placements – at SEND school and secondary school (unassessed)\r\n• Enrichment opportunities \r\n• PGCE (SCITT) with 60 Masters credits\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"The selection process will involve an initial application (two references are required to support this application).\r\n\r\nSuccessful candidates will be invited to a remote interview which will be conducted two members of the SCITT team.\r\n\r\nCandidates will be informed of the outcome of the interview via UCAS within 3 working days.\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"There are 8 primary schools in the Alliance, these are located in South Manchester and Cheshire.  All trainees undertake an assessed teaching practice (5-11) in each school term and experience two schools and both key stages over the three placements; in the third placement they return to their first placement school.  They come together one day per week across the three placements for generic training. \r\n \r\nAs a small provider we endeavour to take account of participants’ locations and personal circumstances when arranging placements. \r\n \r\nIn summary, there are three assessed teaching placements (5-11) over two schools throughout the course.\r\n \r\nIn addition to these the trainees spend some time in early years and in a secondary school environment to experience an educational setting beyond the 5-11 age range. These are called enhancement placement and are not assessed.\r\n","personalQualities":"‘Teaching is the most difficult profession of all. The only time a physician comes close to doing what a teacher does is when the doctor faces an emergency room of multiple patients with multiple conditions, all of whom need immediate attention. That’s what a teacher deals with every day in a class of 30.’\r\nLee Shulman\r\nAdapted from Educational Leadership, Vol 67 (5), February 2010\r\n\r\nYou need a high standard of personal organisation, a willingness to learn, a passion for your subject and, above all, a desire to work with young people to help them achieve their potential. \r\n","otherRequirements":"Before trainee teachers start their training, they must have \r\n\r\n• been screened by the Disclosure and Barring Service to make sure they are not barred from working with children and vulnerable adults\r\n• been assessed as having the health and physical capacity to teach so that children and young people in their care would not be at risk of harm\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:54:31.422Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-12T08:21:47.919Z","cycle":"2023","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"}
