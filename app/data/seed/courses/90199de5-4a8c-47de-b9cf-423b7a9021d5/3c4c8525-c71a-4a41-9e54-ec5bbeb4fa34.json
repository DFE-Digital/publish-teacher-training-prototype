Altius provides a practical and immersive route to teaching underpinned by the highest quality training designed and delivered by expert practioners. Within this ambitious and comprehensive programme trainees are mentored and trained in a professional and research-informed environment to achieve QTS and a PGCE with 60 Master's credits. \r\n\r\nThe programme is structured around the three usual academic terms. All trainees undertake at least one of their three assessed placements in a Laurus Trust school. Training days are integrated into the programme calendar so that knowledge and understanding are built alongside practical application guided by a dedicated mentor. There are dedicated days for the PGCE element of the course.\r\n\r\nThe Altius Curriculum comprises:\r\nThree assessed teaching placements (11-16) with dedicated mentoring \r\n\r\nAdaptive and Inclusive teaching programme\r\nGeneric teaching and learning principles \r\nArt-specific pedagogy programme \r\nBehaviour Management training\r\nProfessional Behaviours programme\r\nEnhancement experiences (SEND, primary and post 16)\r\nEnrichment opportunities \r\n\r\nSupport programme for PGCE (SCITT)  \r\n\r\nThroughout the course trainees receive a specialist art pedagogy programme within which they will learn how to engage, inspire and challenge students as well as how to equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to experiment, invent and create their own works of art, craft and design. Areas covered include drawing, painting, textiles, sculpture, photography, ceramics and printmaking.\r\n\r\nAssessment:\r\nQTS: Trainees' progress against the Altius Curriculum will be monitored throughout the course. Alongside full engagement with the course an electronic portfolio of evidence comprising lesson plans, resources, observation feedback and generic and subject-specific tasks will support the award of QTS. \r\n\r\nPGCE (SCITT): Two assignments (5000 words each) at Master's level.","interviewProcess":"The selection process will involve an initial application (two references are required to support this application).\r\n\r\nSuccessful candidates will be invited for interview. This interview may be carried out face-to-face or remotely by two members of the SCITT team, depending on circumstances.\r\n\r\nCandidates will be informed of the outcome of the interview via APPLY within 3 working days. \r\n\r\nIf applying to teach Art and Design you will be asked to bring/show a portfolio of work on the day. \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"There are approximately 9 secondary schools in the Alliance across Stockport, Manchester and Tameside. Cheadle Hulme High School is the lead Altius school. \r\nThere are three assessed (11-16) teaching placements throughout the course. Trainees start the first placement in September and move to a new context in January for their second placement. They then, usually, return to the first placement school around March to complete the course.\r\n1.  As a small provider we endeavour to take account of participants’ locations and personal circumstances when arranging second placements. \r\n2. In summary, there are three assessed teaching placements (11-16) over two schools throughout the course and at least one of these takes place at a Laurus Trust school.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these placements the trainees spend some time in post 16 and primary environments to experience settings either side of the 11-16 age range. These are called enhancement placements and are not assessed.\r\n","personalQualities":"‘Teaching is the most difficult profession of all. The only time a physician comes close to doing what a teacher does is when the doctor faces an emergency room of multiple patients with multiple conditions, all of whom need immediate attention. That’s what a teacher deals with every day in a class of 30.’\r\nLee Shulman\r\nAdapted from Educational Leadership, Vol 67 (5), February 2010\r\n\r\nYou need a high standard of personal organisation, a willingness to learn, a passion for your subject and, above all, a desire to work with young people to help them achieve their potential. \r\n","otherRequirements":"Before trainee teachers start their training, they must have\r\n\r\n• been screened by the Disclosure and Barring Service to make sure they are not barred from working with children and vulnerable adults\r\n\r\n• been assessed as having the health and physical capacity to teach so that children and young people in their care would not be at risk of harm\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-10-01T13:16:06.819Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-01T13:16:55.283Z"}
