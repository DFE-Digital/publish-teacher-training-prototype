Cheadle Hulme High School is the lead school in the Altius Alliance. All generic training involving the full cohort takes place here.\r\nThere are three assessed (11-16) teaching placements throughout the course. Trainees start the first placement in September and move to a new context in January for their second placement. They then, usually, return to the first placement school around March to complete the course.\r\n1.  As a small provider we endeavour to take account of participants’ locations and personal circumstances when arranging second placements. \r\n2. In summary, there are three assessed teaching placements (11-16) over two schools throughout the course and at least one of these takes place at a Laurus Trust school.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these placements the trainees spend some time in post 16 and primary environments to experience settings either side of the 11-16 age range. These are called enhancement placements and are not assessed.\r\n","personalQualities":"‘Teaching is the most difficult profession of all.
