This tutor is with you from day one until the end of the course to help coach, guide and support you.\r\n\r\nYou will have the opportunity to continue to develop your own subject specific knowledge, linking this to the wider curriculum. The Saint Patrick's school direct course includes 12 days of intense, focused, subject specific input from our partner University and an additional 9 days of support and lectures to enable you to achieve your PGCE. \r\n\r\nSessions are timed to support what you are doing in schools and allow you to reflect and learn from your expereinces.\r\n\r\nThe course has a gradualised build up into teaching. You can plan, teach and share classes with the class teacher so that you can learn as your confidence develops. We have two full induction days before September and a chance to visit your placement schools. This helps you to build a wonderful community with all the trainees and staff that you will be working with.\r\n\r\nWe work in partnership with Liverpool Hope University who have a Gold Standard in Teaching Excellence, ensuring that you always receive the very best training during your teaching year.

It may be however that your interview is conducted remotely. We will email you all the information that you need before you attend an interview. We do not attempt to trip you up or have any surprises in your day.\r\n\r\nThe interview days are a wonderful chance to meet staff you will be working with and have any questions answered that you have.\r\n\r\nWe work in partnership with our trainees, supporting them in becoming the best teachers so that young people in our care can achieve. Our interviews ensure that you have the opportunity to flourish. \r\n\r\nWe realise that you may have more than one interview offered to you and that your work commitments might prevent you from attending an interview. Please let us know if this happens so we can reschedule them for you.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Our trainees complete two contrasting placements so that they can develop the skills needed to be an effective teacher in a range of settings. \r\n\r\nThe Course offers a gradualised teaching timetable, slowly building up your teaching time.\r\n\r\nWe do not have any blocked weeks away from school at University. You are in schools every week so that you can build a relationship with staff and pupils.\r\n\r\nEach year we review our offer to trainees and programme.

We have Greater Manchester and Blackburn schools.\r\n\r\n*We look at the departments that you will be placed in. Sometimes an extra travel time benefits you as you work in a department that is supportive and welcoming. This reduces your stress and workload during the year.\r\n\r\n*Like all ITT providers we can not guarantee you a placement in any one school as the circumstances of schools might change before you being your course.\r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking to support you as you enter a profession that is rewarding and life changing for the young people that we serve.

We expect our trainees to support each other, share advice and be open to learning. They are willing to ask for help and look forward, learning from mistakes.","otherRequirements":"You will be asked to provide certificates as prove of your academic achievements.
