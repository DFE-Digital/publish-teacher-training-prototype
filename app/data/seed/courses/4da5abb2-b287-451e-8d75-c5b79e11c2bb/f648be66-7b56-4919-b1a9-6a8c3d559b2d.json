The course complies with the statutory guidance from the Department for Education for Initial Teacher Training courses.\r\n\r\nThe PGCE in Secondary Education is specifically designed to ensure that those who are successful will be recommended for the award of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) - the professional award required by all those who wish to teach in a maintained school.\r\n\r\nModern Foreign Languages are an exciting and relevant part of the school curriculum. Pupils learn skills in listening, speaking, reading, writing and translation, in a wide range of contexts drawing upon authentic foreign language materials and literary texts. As a trainee you will learn how to teach any combination of French, German and/or Spanish to pupils in the 11-16 age range within the secondary age phase, with additional primary and post-16 enhancements. You will learn how to develop skills, knowledge and understanding for teaching modern foreign languages through a combination of university-led and school-led training.\r\n\r\nSuccessful completion of the course will lead to recommendation for the award of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS), along with 60 credits at Master’s level.","interviewProcess":"Interview and Selection\r\n\r\nFirst Stage: \r\nAll applicants that are successful with their application will be invited to complete a set of short professional scenarios involving reading, writing and numerical tasks. These will provide us with an audit of your existing strengths as well as indicate any areas where you need to develop your knowledge and understanding during your course. \r\nIf you are offered a place following interview, you will be required to demonstrate your professional readiness through successful completion of all of the tasks as one of your conditions of acceptance before the course starts. This may mean that you are asked to attend support sessions in English and mathematics during your course to enable you to demonstrate a satisfactory level of proficiency by the completion of your course.  \r\n\r\nAny work to address shortfalls in English and mathematics must be undertaken by the trainee teacher in addition to other aspects of their training. It is the trainee’s responsibility to secure these fundamental skills before being recommended for Qualified Teacher Status.  \r\n\r\nSecond Stage: \r\nYou will undertake either an observed group task or a subject-specific activity (if you are applying for secondary teacher training).\r\n\r\nThird Stage: \r\nYou will engage in individual face to face interview.\r\n\r\nWe will be assessing your ability to be able to meet the Teachers’ Standards by the completion of your course.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"One of our strengths is that we have a vast network of high quality partnership schools in which to place you for the extended school placements.
