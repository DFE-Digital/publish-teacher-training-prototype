The course complies with the statutory guidance from the Department for Education for Initial Teacher Training courses.\r\n\r\nThe PGCE in Secondary Education is specifically designed to ensure that those who are successful will be recommended for the award of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) - the professional award required by all those who wish to teach in a maintained school.\r\n\r\nIf you have an interest in all areas of History; and have a passion for teaching various aspects of British and world history, then this course will suit you. Our course looks at the key ideas which underpin the teaching of history in schools today and the way children's understanding of concepts develops. As a trainee you will learn how to teach history to pupils in the 11-16 age range within the secondary age phase, with additional primary and post-16 enhancements. You will learn how to develop skills, knowledge and understanding for teaching history through a combination of university-led and school-led training.\r\n\r\nSuccessful completion of the course will lead to recommendation for the award of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS), along with 60 credits at Master’s level.","interviewProcess":"Interview and Selection\r\n\r\nFirst Stage: \r\nAll applicants that are successful with their application will be invited to complete a set of short professional scenarios involving reading, writing and numerical tasks. These will provide us with an audit of your existing strengths as well as indicate any areas where you need to develop your knowledge and understanding during your course. \r\nIf you are offered a place following interview, you will be required to demonstrate your professional readiness through successful completion of all of the tasks as one of your conditions of acceptance before the course starts. This may mean that you are asked to attend support sessions in English and mathematics during your course to enable you to demonstrate a satisfactory level of proficiency by the completion of your course.  \r\n\r\nAny work to address shortfalls in English and mathematics must be undertaken by the trainee teacher in addition to other aspects of their training. It is the trainee’s responsibility to secure these fundamental skills before being recommended for Qualified Teacher Status.  \r\n\r\nSecond Stage: \r\nYou will undertake either an observed group task or a subject-specific activity (if you are applying for secondary teacher training).\r\n\r\nThird Stage: \r\nYou will engage in individual face to face interview.\r\n\r\nWe will be assessing your ability to be able to meet the Teachers’ Standards by the completion of your course.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"One of our strengths is that we have a vast network of high quality partnership schools in which to place you for the extended school placements.

We will also take other factors into consideration when placing you, such as your geographical location and transportation, to provide you with the best possible experience in a convenient and suitable setting.\r\n\r\nThe University-led elements of the course take place at our Walsall Campus. Our PGCE starts in early September and ends in June, and it is an intensive academic and professional training course that effectively prepares you for your first teaching post and beyond.\r\n\r\nThe course comprises of a two day professional placement in mixed subject groups, two extended school placements in your subject specialism and two periods of University-based teaching – September to October and January to February. The programme also includes a short Primary school placement and additional opportunities for a range of enhancements to your course; for example, experience of teaching pupils with special educational needs or teaching pupils for whom English is an additional language.\r\n","personalQualities":"You will have interest in all aspects of history, along with an ability to think creatively about presenting the subject to others in original and practical ways.
