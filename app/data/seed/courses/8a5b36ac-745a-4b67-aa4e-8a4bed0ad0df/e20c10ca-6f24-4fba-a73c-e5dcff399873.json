It may be that several schools will express interest in you. This method ensures you have an increased opportunity of a successful outcome.\r\n\r\nYou will usually be invited to interview where you will be asked to teach a 20 minute learning activity to a class of pupils.\r\n\r\nFollowing the learning activity, you will have an interview with the Professional Mentor and a Head of School. Some schools may ask you to take part in a Student Panel, or to undertake an activity involving students, you may be asked to produce a lesson plan.\r\n\r\nIf all goes well, you will be told the decision and the UCAS website will be updated accordingly.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The major benefit of School Direct is being able to select the school in which you are going to do the majority of your training. This choice is often influenced by location and distance travelling from home.\r\n\r\nUsually you will spend most of your time at your base school, with one day a week spent at Warwick university.\r\n\r\nWe also have a number of Alliance Days where we deliver part of your training to all trainee teachers from across the partnership.\r\n\r\nYour complementary placement takes place after Christmas, usually during the first half of the Spring Term. This is usually set up within the partnership schools and in many cases will be a straight swap between trainees doing the same subject. All the schools within the partnership are within a 30 minute drive of Woodloes Primary School, which is the Lead School in the Partnership.\r\n\r\nAs well as your university mentor, you will have access to a professional mentor at your base school. You will have support every step of the way and will not be expected to fly solo until you feel you're ready to do so. The expectation is that by the time you finish your course you should be teaching around 70% of a teacher's full timetable.\r\n\r\nYou will also be required to undertake a number of written tasks set by the university that will contribute towards a Masters Degree should you wish to complete one. Also, you will be collecting evidence throughout the year to complete your personal learning portfolio which you will use to demonstrate your learning journey.","personalQualities":"We are actively seeking good quality honours graduates with excellent communication skills; who have the ability to enthuse young people about their chosen subject; are able to demonstrate resilience and who are self-starters with the ability to use their initiative.","otherRequirements":"Whilst not a necessity, recent, relevant school experience, or experience of working with young people, is strongly encouraged.
