You will join a community of students at our city centre campus and become part of our LJMU Partnership school family, with whom we work very closely.\r\n\r\nLJMU is unique in the North West in offering a Post Graduate Diploma in Education together with Qualified Teacher Status. This means that our Primary teaching graduates are already skilled teachers two thirds of the way towards a Masters, which many go on to complete during their early career.\r\n\r\nThe Primary PGDE begins with a 3 week induction at the University. Following induction and up until January, student teachers normally spend Mondays (and sometimes the occasional full week) on campus and the other 4 days in school. Later in the year, students spend 5 days in schools, but return to the University for additional full training days  \r\n\r\nThe Primary 5-11 PE programme will focus predominantly on developing your subject knowledge and subject pedagogy in all primary curriculum subjects, so that you have the knowledge, understanding and skills needed to become a  confident teacher of the curriculum across key stages 1 and 2. PE is a specialism, but you are expected to teach all curriculum subjects .\r\n\r\n In addition, lead lectures and seminars will develop your confidence in a range of relevant issues; classroom and behaviour management; meeting individual needs and inclusion; planning and assessment etc. There is a strong emphasis on social justice issues in education and on mental health and well-being. We want you to develop into an inclusive and reflective teacher, with the skills, energy and resilience needed to make a real difference in schools.\r\n\r\nTo achieve Qualified Teacher Status, you will demonstrate that you are able to meet all the requirements of the Teachers’ Standards across the curriculum. This aspect of assessment is largely undertaken by our school-based mentors. LJMU staff are in regular contact with all trainees on placement, undertake co-observations of their teaching and Quality Assure the school-based training across the Partnership. \r\n\r\nThe Postgraduate Diploma is taught and assessed through 4 Modules. The Award of QTS forms one of these Modules. You will also be assessed by completing two essays based on your classroom practice, (one of which focuses on the development of a Scheme of Work) and delivering a case-study presentation.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Applicants are shortlisted and all who meet our entry requirements will be invited to attend an on-line interview. Opportunities to visit the campus are also made available.\r\n\r\nThe selection process involves a presentation to applicants about the programme and an individual interview with members of the course team.\r\n\r\nDetails to support preparations for the interview are sent to successful applicants in advance. Our selection and interview process provides an opportunity to meet our staff team and to ask questions about training to teach with LJMU. Interviews can sometimes involve staff from our partner schools.\r\n\r\nAn applicant’s performance at interview is assessed and a final decision is made, based on a judgement of their performance against a range of criteria. Applicants are normally informed of decisions within 24 hours.\r\n\r\nApplicants will be assessed for their: \r\n*  Relevant subject knowledge and  interest and enthusiasm for teaching the Primary 5-11 age range\r\n*  Suitability for the PE Specialism\r\n*  Understanding of the role and expectations of a Primary teacher\r\n*  Ability to successfully engage learners and to make learning exciting and meaningful to children in a range of contexts\r\n*  Commitment to supporting learners, including in areas of challenging social context\r\n*  Enthusiasm, energy and resilience and ability to work with others in teams and potential to work successfully at Master’s level.\r\n\r\nPrior to starting the course, applicants must be able to provide exam board certified certificates/statements of results of GCSEs (or equivalence) in English, Mathematics and Science. Degree certificates are also needed.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Your school-based experience takes place largely in a Home School, supported by dedicated mentors. We have found that being in a Home School ensures that you are fully integrated into school life and get to know staff, pupils and your subject mentor extremely well, to the benefit of all involved. A member of LJMU staff is attached to each school and is responsible for visiting regularly in order to support all trainees and their mentors. Relationships are very close and constructive. \r\n\r\nAll trainees are entitled to weekly review and feedback meetings with their mentors and to tutorials with LJMU staff. This “wraparound” care ensures that you are consistently supported from start to finish, both personally and professionally.\r\n\r\nYou will be allocated to your Home School during Induction and every effort is made to select schools within reasonable travelling distance. Placements are selected from within the Partnership of LJMU schools, which extends across many local authorities across Merseyside and beyond and includes a diverse range of settings. Our LJMU family of schools are committed to student teacher development and to the Partnership with the University. A range of mentor training and development events hosted both at LJMU and in schools, ensure that our mentors understand our expectations and commit to offering high quality guidance and support to each trainee. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the time spent in a Home School, you will also undertake an alternative placement of roughly 6 weeks in a contrasting school  between January and February. This placement has an explicit focus on a new Key stage and age range. Additional experiences are also often provided for instance through visits to Special Schools and to Secondary Schools. As a PE specialist you will have an increased focus on teaching PE across the 5-11 age range, during school placements.\r\n\r\nSchool experience is structured in Phases, beginning with an observation phase, so that you can develop appropriate confidence and competence, only taking on greater responsibility for planning and teaching as the year progresses. Your final assessment for QTS is conducted at the end of the year. \r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for applicants who have a passion for teaching all subjects in the 5-11 age range  (particularly but by no means  exclusively PE) and who wish to share their passion with children. You should have a genuine  belief that education transforms life chances and want to make a positive difference to children and to their communities. At interview we hope to see your enthusiasm and evidence of some experiences which have informed your decision to become a teacher. A minimum of 5 days’ work experience in a UK primary school is helpful prior to commencing the programme. ","otherRequirements":"\r\nYou are  required to meet the Department for Education’s standards for physical and mental fitness to teach and clearance to work with children. Further information, including a Declaration of Health questionnaire and details of how to apply for a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) Enhanced Disclosure will be sent to you after you have firmly accepted an offer. These form part of your conditions of offer.\r\n\r\nYour offer is conditional until ALL conditions of entry are completed and verified. Please check qualifications carefully . If you need duplicate GCSE certificates you will need to contact your exam board\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:52:10.615Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-10T13:13:20.211Z","cycle":"2023","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
