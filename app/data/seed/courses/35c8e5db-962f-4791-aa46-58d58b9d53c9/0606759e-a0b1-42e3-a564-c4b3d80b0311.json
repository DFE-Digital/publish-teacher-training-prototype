This means that candidates will follow a primary qualification with and additional pathway of SEND. Upon completion trainees are presented with QTS.\r\n\r\nOur course is unique in the fact that you will complete placements in both the primary and special sector. By doing so, we believe that you will become a much more well rounded practitioner that is employable in both sectors.\r\n\r\nOur course runs in partnership with the University of Derby who are recognised as an outstanding HEI provider.\r\n\r\nLink tutor visits, key assessment points and level 6 studies are required to be completed throughout the course of the year. All of these elements are designed to ensure trainees are aware of current pedagogical and theoretical approaches to learning.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the university lectures, trainees are provided with in school 'Hub' days that further deepen the knowledge of classroom pedagogy which are facilitated by current school practitioners in a range of areas.\r\n","interviewProcess":"You will have to attend an interview prior to starting the apprenticeship.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Placements are conducted in contrasting key stages and sectors.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 placements in total.
