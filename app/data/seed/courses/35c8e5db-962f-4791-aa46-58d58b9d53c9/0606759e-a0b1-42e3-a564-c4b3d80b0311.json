All of these elements are designed to ensure trainees are aware of current pedagogical and theoretical approaches to learning.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the university lectures, trainees are provided with in school 'Hub' days that further deepen the knowledge of classroom pedagogy which are facilitated by current school practitioners in a range of areas.\r\n","interviewProcess":"You will have to attend an interview prior to starting the apprenticeship.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Placements are conducted in contrasting key stages and sectors.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 placements in total.
