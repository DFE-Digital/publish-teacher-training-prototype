You will spend the majority of the year working in your ‘home’ school and then approximately six weeks in your ‘away’ school. This gives you the chance to form strong links with both staff and pupils in your ‘home’ placement, so that you are genuinely part of the school community. The ‘away’ school forms a contrast, giving you wider experience.","interviewProcess":"Liverpool College is the lead school in the alliance and will take the lead on the recruitment process. Trainees will be invited to interview at Liverpool College where you will undertake a 20 minute observation, an interview with subject specialists, a tour of the school and an opportunity to speak to current trainees and mentors and finally a numeracy and literacy assessment. If the placement will be mainly in another of the partnership schools they will take the lead on the interview process.\r\nFor more information, please contact Mrs S Lines (Assistant Principal):slines@liverpoolcollege.org.uk","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"There are several schools within the alliance from around Liverpool.
