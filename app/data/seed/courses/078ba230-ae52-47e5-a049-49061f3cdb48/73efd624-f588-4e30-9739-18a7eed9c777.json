You will spend the majority of the year working in your ‘home’ school and then approximately six weeks in your ‘away’ school. This gives you the chance to form strong links with both staff and pupils in your ‘home’ placement, so that you are genuinely part of the school community. The ‘away’ school forms a contrast, giving you wider experience.","interviewProcess":"Liverpool College is the lead school in the alliance and will take the lead on the recruitment process for Business.
