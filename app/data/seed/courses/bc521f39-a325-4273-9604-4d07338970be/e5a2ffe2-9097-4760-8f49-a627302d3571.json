You will benefit from working with our groundbreaking curriculum, which embraces a worldviews and multidisciplinary approach. You will learn how to enable students to build a deep understanding of religious and non-religious worldviews using the disciplines of History, Theology, Philosophy and the Social Sciences.\r\n\r\nYou will build a broad knowledge base that will include Greek and modern philosophy, the Dharmic and Abrahamic traditions and key scholars from the social sciences. In addition, you will learn how to guide your students towards understanding that religion is hugely diverse. Therefore, it is important to both teach classical ideas and challenge those ideas from a diverse range of voices. Those diverse voices include Black and Womanist Theologies and Ambedkar's Buddhist Dalit movement. Finally, you will guide your students to a growing realisation that religious worldviews often do not fit the boxes created by European scholars in the 19th century.\r\n","interviewProcess":"If your application is shortlisted you will be invited to a selection day.
