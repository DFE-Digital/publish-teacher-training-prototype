Although we welcome candidates from a wide variety of experiences, what should unite all candidates is a chemical knowledge acquired from a scientific degree founded on a minimum of 50% chemical science. \r\n\r\nThe goal of any science curriculum should be to enable students to become part of the international scientific community, and to teach them the required knowledge to leave school with an accurate understanding of science, helping them to make informed decisions in life. The course provides you with plentiful opportunities to develop your ability to lead whole-class practical work with confidence and deliver memorable, but purposeful, demonstrations in the classroom.\r\n\r\nBy joining this course you will be conferred into a collaborative professional educational community like no other. You will train alongside other chemistry trainees and be guided and supported by like-minded practitioners including your mentor and subject specialist leaders (SSLs), who have regional and national reputations in the field. You will be able to observe some of these professionals at work; to discuss with them the challenges and opportunities you experience; to learn from them and their various approaches to the discipline.","interviewProcess":"If your application is shortlisted you will be invited to a selection day which will be held in one of our partnership schools. You will spend the day with mentors and with students, taking part in tasks including delivering a presentation, completing a written task, observing and analysing a lesson, and completing an interview. \r\nThe day will give you an insight into what it will be like to work in one of our schools, along with the opportunity to ask questions and meet members of our teaching team.\r\nWe aim to provide applicants with a decision within a week following the selection day. Depending on the outcome of the day we also offer a phone call to provide feedback on your performance during the tasks.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Trainees will have two placements, each in one of our alliance of primary, secondary, and sixth form schools across Norfolk. We have 13 schools within our Trust and additional partnership schools which we are able to place you in, please see [here] (http://www.inspirationtrust.org/40/school-placements) for details of where our placement schools are located. \r\nWe will try to place you in schools that are convenient for you, with priority given to trainees who have families to care for. Where possible, we will do our best to ensure your commute time is no longer than 40 minutes. \r\nIf you are on a Primary course you will be teaching pupils in the age range of 5-11. If you are on a secondary course you will be teaching pupils in the age range of 11-16 with post 16 enhancement. \r\n","personalQualities":"","otherRequirements":"If you are successful in gaining a place on our course we will need to complete suitability checks related to safeguarding, require confirmation of your health and fitness and will also need to obtain satisfactory references.
