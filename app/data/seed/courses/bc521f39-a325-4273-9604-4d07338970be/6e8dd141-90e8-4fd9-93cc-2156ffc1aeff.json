This degree should either have some biology content or candidates should possess a biology A-level (in this instance a biology subject knowledge enhancement course will be provided for successful candidates)\r\n\r\nWe welcome candidates at all stages of their working life. Support and training will be given throughout the course to refresh and strengthen subject knowledge.\r\n\r\nWhat will I study? \r\nThe course explores the relationship between each of the science disciplines in relation to developing a student’s deeper knowledge of biology. An example would be the similarities and differences between energy as a concept in biology, chemistry and physics. We will ensure trainees have relevant knowledge of the English and mathematics curriculum so they can be efficient and precise teachers of science.  We will teach you how to use the latest research into cognitive science to deliver lessons that maximise the progress of all students, including those from less advantaged backgrounds.\r\n\r\nHuman nature drives individuals to make sense of the world around them. It is this predisposition which underpins science as a discipline but also leads to non-scientists drawing their own conclusions from their everyday experiences. These inferences can become the bedrock of an individual’s understanding of the scientific principles that govern the world. During the course trainees learn to recognise when their students possess a commonly held misconception and how as a teacher they can address these issues. There is an emphasis on how this would structure the nature of science lessons and what progress in understanding ‘looks like’.\r\n\r\nThe course provides trainees with plentiful opportunities to develop the ability to lead whole-class practical work with confidence; and deliver memorable but purposeful demonstrations in purpose-built facilities.. The role of practical work is critically evaluated with particular attention given to the use of such activities as: memorable teaching moments;  inspirational science; and the development of the scientific way of thinking.
