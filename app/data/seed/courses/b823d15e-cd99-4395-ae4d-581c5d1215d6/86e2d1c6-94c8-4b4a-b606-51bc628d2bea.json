There are no formal written assignments for recommendation of QTS.\r\n","interviewProcess":"We sift all UCAS applications following a consistent criteria set out in-house, looking at candidate personal qualities, academic achievements and previous relevant experience in schools/working with young people.\r\nFollowing a successful sift, candidates will be invited to an interview day, which dependant on applicant numbers, may be run over one or two days. \r\nThe interview process consists of four parts;\r\n\r\n*A subject knowledge audit – This is not a pass/fail test of your subject knowledge rather an audit of your strengths and areas for improvement. This allows us to understand your baseline and develop strategies for how we can work with you to fill any subject knowledge gaps prior to the course beginning, and to continue to provide bespoke support.\r\n*Unseen task - Information on the task is given on the interview day.\r\n*Panel interview – Your education philosophy and values, resilience, and knowledge of National Curriculum will all be explored during the panel interview.\r\n*20 minute session delivery to a Primary class – You will be provided with a topic for the session (set by the class teacher) a week in advance to allow you to prepare. During the session we will be looking at how candidates have demonstrated learner progress, their relationships with young people, and their ability to plan.\r\n We aim to share outcomes of the interview process on the day, including detailed and meaningful feedback where applicable. All offers made by us are conditional, and will be explained when the offer is made.\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Trainees will complete experience in Early Years Foundation Stage and Secondary phases before beginning the programme, and will have experience in at least two primary schools during training.  \r\nPartnership schools are across Solihull, South Warwickshire and Birmingham – including urban and rural, infant, junior, primary, large, Small and faith schools.  Trainees are required to complete an extended period in school on placement, with further enhancement days provided to support their professional development. \r\n\r\nThe SCITT course is tailored to meet the needs of schools, producing confident teachers with high levels of practical teaching skills.  Trainees take what they have learned in the training room directly into the primary classroom where they then put it into practice under the supervision and guidance of mentors with a keen interest in the teaching of mathematics and colleagues including mathematics subject experts from within our Multi-Academy Trust who will provide support, feedback and key guidance to ensure that our Primary Generalist with Mathematics trainees make the required progress. Throughout the programme trainees have the opportunity to immerse themselves fully in school life, participating in INSET days, extra-curricular activities, parent meetings and cross-curricular events.\r\n","personalQualities":"The Tudor Learning Habits;\r\n- Positive self-regulation\r\n- Process not product\r\n- Open to failure and feedback\r\n- Courageous and gritty\r\n\r\nThe Tudor Character Habits;\r\n- Honesty and truthfulness\r\n- Kindness and empathy\r\n- Responsibility and integrity \r\n- Generosity and gratitude\r\n","otherRequirements":"All successful candidates will be subject to;\r\nAn enhanced DBS check, candidates must fund this themselves although Tudor Grange SCITT will make the application.\r\nAn occupational health check.\r\nConfirmation of right to work in the UK.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:53:28.969Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-19T19:14:15.977Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"}
