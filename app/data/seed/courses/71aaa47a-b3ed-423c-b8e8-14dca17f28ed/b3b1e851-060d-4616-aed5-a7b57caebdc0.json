It is taught by experienced and friendly staff who have been successful teachers and continue to maintain strong links with schools.  \r\n\r\nOur trainee teachers usually spend Monday at University and receive subject knowledge and professional study sessions on Friday at MAITT’s training centre. The other 3 days are based in school.  As the programme progresses the amount of time spent in school increases, with up to 80% teaching commitment. Throughout the year students return to University for additional full training weeks, however, the majority of time (at least 120 days) is spent developing teaching skills in one of our partnership schools.\r\n\r\nThe Primary programme will focus predominantly on developing your subject knowledge and subject pedagogy in all primary curriculum subjects, so that you have the knowledge, understanding and skills needed to become a confident teacher of the 5-11 age range. In addition, lead lectures and seminars will develop your confidence in a range of relevant issues; classroom and behaviour management; meeting individual needs and inclusion; planning and assessment etc. There is a strong emphasis on social justice issues in education and on mental health and well-being.
