Some of our partner schools may also invite you to join their July/September induction days. Following this induction you will start in your main placement school and meet the team, complete all compulsory safeguarding training and start to immerse yourself in school life. As a salaried trainee, you will have classes to teach by yourself from the outset.\r\n\r\nThroughout the course you will have weekly Education and Professional Studies sessions based at the SCITT hub at Landau Forte College. These sessions will provide a framework for you to develop as a teacher and support the practical side of your training with up to date academic research based input. \r\n\r\nFor the salaried programme, you will have the opportunity to earn a salary while training to become a qualified teacher. The programme leads to a QTS, the cost of which is covered by the school. Trainees on salaried programmes are recruited and employed directly by schools, and may continue teaching in their school following training.\r\n\r\nThere is an option to gain a PGCE with 60 Master's Level credits at an additional cost. As it’s a salaried route, you won’t be able to apply for financial support so you will need to self-fund. The University of Derby facilitate the PGCE content of the programme and support you with evidence based research assignments.\r\n","interviewProcess":"It is important to take the time and care over your application to us. Once you have been shortlisted, you will be invited to attend the assessment process either online or face to face at our SCITT hub in Derby or at one of our partnership schools (COVID permitting). \r\n\r\nWe ask candidates to teach a short 15 minute lesson in your subject to a small group of students. An interview with a small panel will include some general teaching and subject specific questions which allows you to demonstrate your passion and enthusiasm for your subject and why you have decided to become a teacher. We want to get to know the person behind the application. You will also be expected to complete a number of other subject related tasks; a subject knowledge audit so we can review your level of subject knowledge prior to the course, a subject GCSE exam question, a literacy task based on a piece of reflective writing and a maths challenge.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Our partner schools are located in Derby, Derbyshire and Tamworth. Most of your school based training will take place in one school from September to July, with a shorter second placement in a contrasting school during the year. Trainees will be expected to be able to travel to locations up to a 30 minute drive so that we are able to give you a contrasting experience.\r\nWe also organise primary placements and a specialist placement to a local SEND school to develop your knowledge of transition to secondary and SEND. A placement is also available at a pupil referral behavioural unit for those trainees who wish to experience this. Throughout your placement, you will have the opportunity to take part in all aspects of life as a teacher. You will have a close team of people around you to support, guide and mentor you to achieve success as a teacher and feel ready to take up the challenge of being a Early Career Teacher.\r\n\r\nTraining and teaching in Derby offers the best of both worlds - multicultural city life on the doorstep of a stunning rural environment. Derby is at the heart and centre of the country and has great transport links such as East Midlands Airport and train links to all areas of the country. It is home to global businesses like Rolls Royce, Bombardier and Toyota and the UNESCO World Heritage site of Derwent Valley Mills.\r\n","personalQualities":"A genuine interest in young people and a passion for their development and well-being are key. We expect you to be resilient, work hard and be committed, but the work will be rewarding. Teaching is a job where you can really make a difference to young people's lives. Teaching is about working with others - pupils, colleagues, parents and carers. By working in our schools we encourage you to work collaboratively, both with other trainees and with our teachers.","otherRequirements":"We are committed to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children and young people and expect all staff and volunteers to share this commitment. All trainees will have a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) criminal records check including a check of the children’s barred list.","status":2,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:49:26.199Z","canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","cycle":"2023","salaryDetails":"For the salaried programme, you will have the opportunity to earn a salary while training to become a qualified teacher.
