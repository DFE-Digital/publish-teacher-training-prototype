It cannot be guaranteed that placements will be in the closest school due to additional factors. For more information as to which academies are part of Delta Academies Trust, please visit our website.\r\n\r\nTrainees will follow their Academy calendar and the timetable at the University, training in academies four days per week throughout the whole academic year.  Each Friday trainees attend the University to learn as part of a professional cohort of training teachers and spend the rest of the week honing their teaching skills in their Academy. Each trainee will have a dedicated mentor within each of the placement schools as a point of contact and a person to support their personalised development.\r\n\r\nThe course will lead to a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) with the opportunity of gaining up to 60 credits at Masters level, as well as meeting the requirements of Teacher Standards (QTS).\r\n","personalQualities":"Delta Academies Trust, is looking for candidates who demonstrate a clear passion for teaching and a desire to ensure young people achieve their full potential.
