You will critically evaluate the effectiveness of a wide range of resources and your own lesson plans. You will analyse research data and critically evaluate how research has contributed to the knowledge and understanding of how to teach Drama with English effectively.\r\n\r\nWe will help trainees to acquire the skills and expertise to support student’s learning, prepare them to teach in an inclusive environment, provide professional development and ensure that trainees show a concern for professional values and demonstrate the positive attitudes and behaviour expected from pupils.\r\n\r\nFor further information\r\nhttps://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/secondary-drama\r\nhttps://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/school-direct-qts\r\n","interviewProcess":"The Head of Department at the 'host' school will be interviewing you along with a member of the Senior Leadership Team. \r\n\r\nYou will also be asked to prepare a lesson or part of a lesson in your subject to deliver to a group of students in order to assess your interaction and communication skills with young people. \r\n\r\nAt the interview stage, your suitability for teaching will be assessed including your subject knowledge for teaching and competency in the fundamental skills of English and Maths. If any shortfall is identified, you may be required to complete some additional work to secure the appropriate level of competency before being accepted on the programme. During the programme your competency in these areas will be developed and assessed to ensure you reach the required level.\r\n\r\nOne interview will take place at the school and then a further interview will take place with the university.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"During your training year, you will spend at least 120 days in schools. This includes placements in two secondary schools, your host school that you have stated on your application form and a partner school within the BTSA alliance.

You will return to University for one day each week for lectures, seminars and workshops with the secondary education team. \r\n\r\nEach placement provides a sustained teaching experience with a gradual increase in responsibility for planning, teaching and assessment. Within the placements, you will be supported by school-based mentors as well as your University Tutor.","personalQualities":"We are looking for ambitious trainee teachers who demonstrate their passion and enthusiasm for teaching and have a desire to share this with young people. \r\n\r\nYou should be highly motivated, able to adapt and have the resilience to work well under pressure.
