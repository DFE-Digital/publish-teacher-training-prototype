You will critically evaluate the effectiveness of a wide range of resources and your own lesson plans. You will analyse research data and critically evaluate how research has contributed to the knowledge and understanding of how to teach History with Humanities effectively.\r\n\r\nWe will help trainees to acquire the skills and expertise to support student’s learning, prepare them to teach in an inclusive environment, provide professional development and ensure that trainees show a concern for professional values and demonstrate the positive attitudes and behaviour expected from pupils.\r\n\r\nFor further information\r\nhttps://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/secondary-history-humanities\r\nhttps://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/school-direct-qts\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"The Head of Department at the 'host' school will be interviewing you along with a member of the Senior Leadership Team. \r\n\r\nYou will also be asked to prepare a lesson or part of a lesson in your subject to deliver to a group of students in order to assess your interaction and communication skills with young people. \r\n\r\nAt the interview stage, your suitability for teaching will be assessed including your subject knowledge for teaching and competency in the fundamental skills of English and Maths. If any shortfall is identified, you may be required to complete some additional work to secure the appropriate level of competency before being accepted on the programme.
