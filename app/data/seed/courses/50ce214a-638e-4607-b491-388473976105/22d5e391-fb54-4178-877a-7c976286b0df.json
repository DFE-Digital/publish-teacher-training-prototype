It is also one of the most rewarding. To make sure you’re a successful and confident teacher in the 21st-century, we have devised a vibrant programme informed by research and constantly reviewed to ensure students are equipped with the most up-to-date developments in primary education. The course prepares you to teach across the age ranges 5-11 and is structured around taught modules based at Poole SCITT and placement modules based in schools (mainstream and special) and other educational settings. You will undertake studies in all elements of primary education; extend your knowledge of learning and teaching, of the breadth and scope of the curriculum and the professional skills associated with high-quality teaching. You will then apply these areas of understanding and skill to classroom practice throughout the year during two assessed placements in schools or educational settings. Our PGCE in Primary with SEND specialism is significantly enhanced with aspects of Special Educational Needs & Disability (SEND) delivered by specialist teachers from Linwood School. The programme content is delivered through a series of non-assessed and assessed school based placements. These placements are in both mainstream primary and special school settings. Trainees are guided through their learning by experienced staff and school based mentors, to enable them to gain the skills and confidence to become effective, successful teachers of primary aged children, especially those with SEND. The programme is designed for trainee teachers wishing to enter the profession in either mainstream or special school settings. Placements will take place in Poole SCITT and Linwood Training, Support & Advice partner schools in Bournemouth, Poole and Dorset. \r\nUpon successful completion of the course you will be awarded a PGCE with recommendation for the award of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). \r\n","interviewProcess":"Applicants are selected from applications through the DfE application site (https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-teacher-training). You should write a full personal statement giving reasons for wanting to teach. You should cite any experience of working with children (although strongly recommended, this is not an essential requirement for application). \r\nCareful consideration should be made as to referees. At least one of your references should be from someone who can comment upon your working with children. \r\nIf you meet or are expected to meet entry requirements, and have demonstrated your passion and commitment to teaching in your application, you'll be invited to attend an interview. Please make it clear on applications if you are working towards GCSE qualifications and when results will be known. \r\nThe interview is your chance to demonstrate your potential to become a successful teacher. Successful candidates will be invited to attend an assessment session with Literacy and Numeracy testing, group and individual interviews.  The interview is also your chance to find out more about the course.\r\nMore specific details about interviews will be provided to candidates by email if successful in application, so please provide a valid and regularly monitored email address on application forms.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Trainees are based at the Poole SCITT centre at Ad Astra Infant School and school experience is within partner schools within Poole SCITT and  Linwood Training, Support & Advice, which include primary mainstream and other local special schools. Trainees are included in the PGCE cohort of Poole SCITT and Kingston University. The course consists of two placements: one in a mainstream school and another in a special school local to Linwood School to enhance your SEND knowledge and practices.","personalQualities":"We will look for evidence of a commitment to the teaching profession, an understanding of professional requirements, and an awareness of current educational issues in an application. Prior experience in a school is not required, however prospective students may find experience in a school useful for obtaining insights into the primary education classroom. Experience in a school or similar setting may also provide reassurance to prospective students that teaching is the right choice for their career.","otherRequirements":"All offers made will be subject to Criminal Records Checks, prohibition from teaching checks and medical clearance and where necessary, satisfactory completion of degrees and other minimum qualification requirements.  You will be sent more information about when and how you need to complete each of these checks if you accept an offer.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:55:18.737Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-29T09:00:32.163Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2024"}
