Please see further updates from DfE Get into Teaching website.\r\n\r\nNTS also offer some salaried routes for trainees as well as supporting secondary applicants in gaining subject specific scholarships (giving a 2K uplift on normal bursary values) as well as wider benefits.\r\n\r\nNTS supports trainees to access Subject Knowledge Enhancement courses (only if given as part of a conditional offer).  SKE courses are available, in selected subjects, for either a 8, 12 or 16 week period. The SKE's are funded by the DofE for the pre-course year and if you are eligible, you will receive £200 per week for the SKE bursary. ","aboutCourse":"At Nottinghamshire Torch SCITT we pride ourselves on ensuring all our trainee teachers have an exceptional training experience.\r\n\r\nThe majority of your time will be spent in your placement schools to gain qualified teacher status developing your practice working alongside school-based mentors.\r\n\r\n- The course starts with an intensive 2 week induction programme to the teaching and learning process, including discussion and development of basic elements of teaching, introduction to planning and curriculum, behaviour management and safeguarding, etc.  You will experience a range of school settings, meet over 30 different educational experts and feel fully confident before you start. This will enable deeper, more detailed coverage of the professional standards to be done later during the training year. The aim is to give you a thorough grounding prior to starting school placements. \r\n- Fridays will be spent on core and subject specific training as well as 10 days across the year at the University of Nottingham where you will gain your PGCE and Masters credits.\r\n- We have a dedicated team of Subject Specific Mentors across our alliance who will ensure you are supported in your school and will quality assure the training you are undertaking.\r\n- Timetables will be developed to progress practice, by having an escalation of the number of lessons taught, and/or developing stages in practice, from supporting the class teacher, to team teaching with the class teacher, to taking elements of a lesson, to taking full lessons.\r\n- You will have two main placement schools and through training and extended placements visit over 10 schools within our partnership.\r\n- We offer you an international experience which is a unique feature of the programme enabling you to more deeply appreciate the need to secure high standards and outcomes for students, to enable them to compete in a global world.  We believe this experience can assist you in deepening your pedagogical thinking and help you to develop into reflective practitioners.\r\n- You will experience a range of special educational needs (both during mainstream placements and via a special school visit), strategies for supporting students with such needs plus real experiences of differentiation and personalised learning which will give you an excellent grounding for teaching SEN/D students within mainstream education.\r\n- Throughout the course you will receive exceptional levels of support and care from the SCITT core team, mentors and subject specialists to ensure you succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Torch SCITT Website](http://teachnottinghamshire.co.uk/)\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"We will screen your application and decide whether to offer you an interview.  Your Apply application form is viewed very carefully, in particular, we are interested in your wider potential which we can see through your personal statement, qualifications and your experience (even if it isn't in teaching).\r\n\r\nUse the personal statement to convince us that you genuinely want to teach and will make a good teacher. Make sure that you have given us a clear indication of the subject content of your degree.  On the basis of our consideration of your application form and the references, you may be invited to an interview.  There are likely to be other applicants being interviewed alongside you in an initial group task.\r\n\r\nDuring the interview process, you will be asked to teach a 20 minute activity to a small group of children, complete a subject - related written task and to give a short presentation on \"Why I want to become a teacher\". The formal interview will follow.  During this time, we observe you for your wider potential to teach. You have the opportunity to ask any questions that you may have and most people find it an enjoyable not threatening experience.\r\n\r\nYou will be interviewed by the staff from the Nottinghamshire Torch SCITT.\r\n\r\nWe will inform you of our decision as soon as possible after your interview. If you are offered a conditional offer, you will receive a pack of information describing the steps you should take next.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The Nottinghamshire Torch SCITT Partnership Schools (over 30) are fully invested in the programme. Heads of School all want NTS trainees to succeed as they require a highly skilled workforce. All of our partnership schools are highly experienced in delivering ITT in school provision.\r\nThe Nova Education Trust and SCITT partnership have an extensive range of schools within both the Primary and Secondary sector across Nottinghamshire, Nottingham City, Derby and Leicestershire.\r\n\r\n [Torch SCITT Website](http://teachnottinghamshire.co.uk/)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe aim to recruit a strong cohort of trainees with approximately 4-10 maximum in each subject area. We then, through agreement with trainees, arrange the best suited placement schools. We look to minimise travel distance for trainees, maximise the quality of mentorship and school support. Most school partners will host 4-10 trainees at any one time (across the range of subjects). This allows for trainees to not feel isolated and to be able to support each other on placement. We also provide all trainees with contrasting school experiences as this is important in developing a range of professional skills.\r\n\r\nOn the secondary programme, you will be teaching the 11-16 range and most partnership schools are post 16 providers too so we encourage all our trainees to experience both vocational and examination for 16-19.\r\n\r\nSchools within our partnership are:-\r\n\r\n[Garibaldi College](http://www.garibaldi.org.uk/)\r\n[Kirk Hallam Community Academy](http://kirkhallamacademy.co.uk/)\r\n[Madani Schools Federation](http://www.madani.leicester.sch.uk/)\r\n[Meden School](http://www.medenschool.co.uk/)\r\n[Newark Academy](http://www.newarkacademy.co.uk/)\r\n[Nottingham Free School](http://www.nottinghamfreeschool.co.uk/)\r\n[Nottingham University Academy of Science and Technology](http://nuast.org.uk/)\r\n[Nottingham University Samworth Academy](http://www.nusa.org.uk/) \r\n[South Notts Academy](http://www.southnottinghamshireacademy.org.uk/)\r\n[Suthers School](http://www.suthersschool.co.uk/)\r\n[Toot Hill School](http://www.toothillschool.co.uk/)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Torch SCITT Website](http://teachnottinghamshire.co.uk/)\r\n\r\nNottinghamshire Torch SCITT will be offering secondary SCITT and School Direct places for 2022.\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"* A desire to teach and work with young people - ideally evidenced through some prior school experience\r\n* Effective communication skills - confidence and the ability to relate to children and young adults\r\n* Creativity - the ability to think differently to devise interesting and engaging lessons\r\n* Professionalism\r\n* High levels of energy and physical/mental resiliance\r\n* A commitment to work hard on the course\r\n* A determination to succeed\r\n* A readiness to listen and share\r\n* A flexible approach to learning and teaching\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"* Fitness to teach - A declaration of health questionnaire will be completed by successful applicants and sent to Occupational Health Services.\r\n\r\n* Disclosure and barring service (DBS) - For all initial teacher training courses, applicants must complete forms requesting an Enhanced Disclosure from the DBS.
