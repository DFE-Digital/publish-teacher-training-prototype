Beyond this core team, some of the very best science teachers and senior leaders currently working in our area contribute to the high quality of the training provided. There are also structured opportunities to plan and conduct fieldwork sessions in the beautiful New Forest National Park and, of course, the opportunity to work with an exceptional team of school-based mentors.\r\n\r\n[The PGCE Secondary Science: Biology course](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/education/postgraduate/itt_courses/pgce_sciences.page)\r\n","interviewProcess":"Once you have applied to SUPA Salisbury you will be invited for interview at one of the schools in the Alliance.  The interview process will involve three key elements:\r\n1). An interview with a panel containing at least one senior member of staff from the school and a member of staff from the University of Southampton.\r\n2). A basic written task to check literacy levels. This task will not require you to carry out any preparation and is a normal task that a teacher might need to carry out in their working day.\r\n3). A  student based activity - a brief task with a small group of students. Further details will be provided to you in advance of your interview so that you have time to prepare. We understand that you are not yet trained as a teacher and so this task is simply to assess your potential and your ability to relate to our students.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"School placements will make up the bulk of your training year as they play a vital role in providing you with the skills and experience needed to be a successful teacher. However, we fully understand that standing in front of a class for the first time can be a very daunting experience for some. For this reason, we will provide you with all the training and support you need so that you feel fully prepared when the time comes.\r\n\r\nThe training year is broken down as follows:\r\n\r\nTerm 1 – Initial Training and Home School Placement 1\r\n\r\nYou will spend the first two weeks in September following an induction programme in your Home School. This gives you the opportunity to gain an understanding of the systems and functions of your Home School, meet key staff and observe some lessons so when you return you are familiar with procedures and routines. You will then attend approximately two weeks training in the university. Once this initial training is complete the rest of the term is spent back in your Home school while still attending university training days on Fridays. \r\n\r\n Term 2 - January - February– Focus School\r\nIn January, you will move onto your second teaching placement in your Focus School. This second placement school will be chosen from the whole university partnership, with the aim of giving the trainee teacher a contrasting experience compared to their Home School. However, we will always endeavour to keep your daily commute to a minimum. You will remain there until February whilst you complete a personalised programme of teaching practice and professional training.  During this time, you will return to the University for regular training days.\r\n\r\nTerms 2 - 3 - February - June - Home School Placement 2\r\nIn late February, you will return to your Home School and continue with your personalised programme of teaching practice and professional training. Your teaching contact time will increase during this placement but will not exceed 11 hours per week.\r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for trainee teachers who are passionate and enthusiastic about their subject and have a desire to share this with young people.\r\n\r\nSkills\r\nYou will need to demonstrate dedication, tenacity and creativity and be an  excellent communicator. \r\nYou should hold a strong knowledge of your specialist subject and be able to communicate your knowledge in a clear and inspiring way. \r\nExperience\r\nIdeally, we are looking for candidates who have had some form of experience working with young people. This could be in a variety of settings such as through in school work or in the wider world.  \r\n","otherRequirements":"Before starting on the PGCE programme you will be required:\r\n- To complete a form describing your state of health which will be checked against the DfE Fitness to Teach regulations \r\n- To provide an Enhanced Disclosure from the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) to confirm that there are no criminal offences on your record which would bar you from teaching. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt would also be a great advantage if you have had some recent experience in a school or working with children either in a school environment or elsewhere.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:54:07.051Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-05T09:07:20.173Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2023"}
