This partner school is known as the trainee’s main placement school. You can view which schools we work with and which subjects they offer [here](https://bbscitt.co.uk/our-schools/). All of our schools offer these subjects at age range 11-16 (Key Stage 3 and Key Stage 4), with a Post-16 enhancement available. The only exceptions to this are our Business Studies and Psychology courses which are 14-19 (Key Stage 4 and Key Stage 5) where a Key Stage 3 enhancement is possible. \r\n\r\nOur trainees are based in their main placement school from September to December (Term 1) and from March to June (Term 3). \r\n\r\nFrom January to March (Term 2) trainees will spend time in a contrasting school placement, sometimes referred to as 'second placement'. Arrangements for the contrasting placement school are made centrally by the SCITT in a timely manner once the course has commenced. A trainee's emerging teaching strengths and areas of development, locality and personal circumstances are taken closely into consideration when making these arrangements. \r\n\r\nTrainees are supported, developed and assessed by our trained and experienced team of Professional Mentors and Subject Mentors in the same way across all of our placement schools. Additionally, trainees also receive:\r\n\r\n* Central, whole-cohort Professional Studies sessions to learn about the key topics in education\r\n* Specific Subject Studies sessions, led by a dedicated, subject-specific course leader to impart the pedagogy of teaching your subject\r\n* The opportunity to be trained on best practice in a range of key areas of teaching in a number schools through our carousel weeks \r\n* An opportunity to observe Key Stage 2 teaching and consider the Key Stage 2 to 3 transition through a short placement in a primary school.\r\n","personalQualities":"Full details of the personal qualities that Barr Beacon SCITT trainees have can be found on [our website](https://bbscitt.co.uk/recruitment-process/).
