Please make sure you have applied for the correct programme.  \r\n\r\nTrainees apply to Barr Beacon SCITT and assessment days will be carried out by Ryders Hayes on behalf of Barr Beacon SCITT. Ryders Hayes allocate trainees a placement school within the SCITT partnership. We strongly believe in creating a ‘best fit’ between the host school and the trainee, in the belief that they are one of the staff team and a potential employee. \r\n\r\nOur trainees are based in their main placement school from September to December (Term 1) and from March to June (Term 3). \r\n\r\nFrom January to March (Term 2) trainees will spend time in a contrasting school placement, sometimes referred to as 'second placement'. Arrangements for the contrasting school placement are made centrally by the SCITT/Ryders Hayes in a timely manner once the course has commenced. A trainee's emerging strengths and areas of development, locality and personal circumstances are taken closely into consideration when making these decisions. \r\n\r\nTrainees are supported, developed and assessed by our expert team of mentors in the same way across all of our placement schools. Additionally trainees receive: \r\n* Training in a diverse range of educational settings, including regular training at Ryders Hayes from expert facilitators, providing a detailed ‘hands-on’ school-based experience. \r\n* A bespoke training package for each trainee, including additional support in specialist subjects to promote access to all aspects of school life.\r\n\r\nAdditional information for our part-time courses:\r\n* Our part-time programme covers the same content as the one year full-time route spread across a two year route, with adjusted placement timings to account for the part-time nature of the course allowing for continuation of part-time employment whilst training.","personalQualities":"Full details of the personal qualities that Barr Beacon SCITT trainees have can be found on [our website](https://bbscitt.co.uk/recruitment-process/).
