Until January, you will normally spend Fridays (and sometimes the occasional full week) at the university and the other 4 days in school. Later in the year, you will return to the university for additional full training weeks, but the majority of your time will be spent training in our schools. \r\n\r\nIn order to achieve Qualified Teacher Status (QTS), you will demonstrate that you are able to meet all the requirements of the Teachers’ Standards. This aspect of assessment is largely undertaken by school-based mentors. LJMU staff are in regular contact with all trainees on placement, undertake co-observations of their teaching and Quality Assure the school-based training across the Partnership. \r\nThe PGCE is assessed through 2 Modules, one of these modules uses the evidence you gather to be awarded QTS. You will also complete a reflective essay, linked to your classroom practice. \r\n","interviewProcess":"Shortlisting: All applicants who meet the entry requirements will be invited to attend a selection event. \r\nSelection events: The selection process will involve a presentation, an Geography classroom task and an interview with school staff and members of our partnership. Details to support preparation for the event are sent to successful applicants along with an invitation to attend. Our selection and interview day will also give applicants further information about our programmes and provide an opportunity to meet our friendly and dedicated team. \r\nApplicants are normally informed of decisions within 24 hours. \r\nApplicants will be assessed for their: \r\n•\tDepth of relevant subject knowledge and their interest and enthusiasm for teaching Geography\r\n•\tAbility to successfully engage learners and to make learning exciting and meaningful to young people in a range of contexts \r\n•\tCommitment to supporting learners, including in areas of challenging social context \r\n•\tEnthusiasm, energy and resilience and ability to work with others in teams and potential to work successfully at Master’s level \r\nApplicants are asked to bring evidence of GCSEs in English and Mathematics with them to interview, along with degree certificates if they have already graduated. \r\n \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Your school-based experience takes place largely in your Home School, supported by well- trained mentors, experienced staff with expertise in Geography. We have found that being in a Home School ensures that you are fully integrated into school life and get to know staff, pupils and your subject mentor extremely well, to the benefit of all involved. A member of LJMU staff is normally attached to each school and is responsible for visiting regularly in order to support all trainees and their mentors. Relationships are very close and constructive. \r\nIn addition to the time spent in a Home School, you will also undertake an alternative placement of roughly 6 weeks in a contrasting school between January and February. This placement has an explicit focus on diversity and inclusion. Additional experiences are also often provided for instance through visits to Special Schools and to Primary Schools. Although the LJMU programmes focus on 11-16 experience, you will also gain experience of post-16 planning and teaching during your school experience. \r\nSchool experience is structured in phases, beginning with an observation phase, so that you can develop appropriate confidence and competence, taking on greater responsibility for planning and teaching as the year progresses. Your final assessment for QTS is conducted at the end of the year, in collaboration with your mentor. \r\nAll trainees are entitled to weekly review and feedback meetings with their mentors and to tutorials with LJMU staff. This ‘wraparound’ care ensures that you are consistently supported from start to finish, both personally and professionally. \r\nA range of mentor training and development events hosted both at LJMU and in schools, ensure that our mentors understand our expectations and commit to offering high quality guidance and support to each trainee. \r\n \r\n","personalQualities":"","otherRequirements":"\r\n\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-12T13:48:27.280Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-01T14:24:52.047Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2024"}
