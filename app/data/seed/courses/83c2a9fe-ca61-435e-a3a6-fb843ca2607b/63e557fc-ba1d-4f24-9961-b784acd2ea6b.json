Trainee teachers are treated as professionals who are part of the school team. Your ITT Mentor/Professional Mentor in both your 'home' and 'away' school will support your development in school.  \r\n\r\nThe taught element of our School Direct programme at North West Learning Partnership will be delivered by outstanding and specialised trainers – Head teachers, Specialist Leaders in Education, experienced consultants and outstanding practitioners who are still involved in teaching. The majority of the training sessions delivered by North West Learning Partnership take place in our placement schools and other venues, and the Primary PGCE is taught at LJMU. Your specialism in P.E. will be incorporated in the training delivered and you will have opportunity to observe P.E. specialists in school. Trainee teachers will spend some days training with both NWLP and LJMU. However, they continue to spend time in school throughout the whole programme. \r\n\r\nThe Primary programme will focus predominantly on developing your subject knowledge and subject pedagogy in all primary curriculum subjects, so that you have the knowledge, understanding and skills needed to become a confident teacher of the 5-11 age range. In addition, training sessions will develop your confidence in a range of relevant issues; classroom and behaviour management; meeting individual needs and inclusion; planning and assessment etc. There is a strong emphasis on social justice issues in education and on mental health and well-being. We want you to develop into an inclusive and reflective teacher, with the skills, energy and resilience needed to make a real difference in schools. \r\n\r\nIn order to achieve Qualified Teacher Status, you will demonstrate that you are able to meet all the requirements of the Teachers’ Standards. This aspect of assessment is largely undertaken by your Professional Mentor in school and Liaison Tutor. Trainees will also be supported both by North West Learning Partnership and LJMU staff. On placement, they will undertake co-observations of your teaching and quality assure the school-based training across the Partnership. \r\n\r\nThe Postgraduate Certificate is assessed through 2 Modules. The LJMU course team and North West Learning Partnership School Direct have worked together to ensure that the modules are both relevant and manageable. You will also complete a two-part essay, which requires you to reflect on your developing classroom practice. ","interviewProcess":"All applicants who meet the entry requirements will be invited to attend an interview.  Interviews, when not on line, take place at one of the schools within the Three Saints Academy Trust. There will be at least two representatives from all our partners, including university, on the interview panel. The interview process includes a presentation based on a planned lesson and a formal interview. You will also be asked to complete a written English task and a Mathematics task. Further information will be provided prior to the interview.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Trainee teachers will be allocated a 'home' school in one of our placement schools for one academic year, all of which are outstanding or good. We provide a personalised and supportive training approach and therefore the location of your home school will be taken into consideration, in addition to other factors. You will have two Teaching Practice phases in your home school and one in your away school. The away school is a contrasting experience. We aim to allocate placements which are best fit for your development. You will have a Professional Mentor in both your home and away school who will support your development. You will also receive support and guidance from the School Direct Strategic Lead. \r\n\r\nIn addition to your home and away school, you also have a day placement in our partner High School, Special Schools and in Foundation Stage. We believe that these placements are important and enhance your training within the primary phase. ","personalQualities":"Relevant subject knowledge for Primary teaching and their interest in and enthusiasm for teaching the 5-11 age range  \r\nAbility to successfully engage learners and to make learning exciting and meaningful to children in a range of contexts \r\nCommitment to supporting learners, including in areas of challenging social context \r\nEnthusiasm, energy and resilience and ability to work with others in teams and potential to work successfully at Master’s level.
