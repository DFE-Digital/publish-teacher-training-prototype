to our affiliation with North West Three Maths Hub, we offer a unique Primary with Mathematics School Direct Teacher Training programme for graduates, in partnership with Liverpool John Moores University. North West Three Maths Hub is at the forefront of the development of high-quality teaching in Mathematics. Trainee teachers will access our Primary General training with additional training units in Mathematics delivered by our Teaching for Mastery specialists, Maths PDLs and SLEs in addition to external experts. Trainees will also benefit from working with and observing these specialists.\r\n\r\nThe taught element of our School Direct programme at North West Learning Partnership will be delivered by outstanding and specialised trainers – Head teachers, Specialist Leaders in Education, experienced consultants and outstanding practitioners who are still involved in teaching. The majority of the training sessions delivered by North West Learning Partnership take place in our placement schools and other venues, and the Primary PGCE is taught at LJMU. Trainee teachers will spend some days training with both NWLP and LJMU. However, they continue to spend time in school throughout the whole programme.\r\n\r\nThe Primary programme will focus predominantly on developing your subject knowledge and subject pedagogy in all primary curriculum subjects, so that you have the knowledge, understanding and skills needed to become a confident teacher of the 5-11 age range. In addition, training sessions will develop your confidence in a range of relevant issues; classroom and behaviour management; meeting individual needs and inclusion; planning and assessment etc. There is a strong emphasis on social justice issues in education and on mental health and well-being. We want you to develop into an inclusive and reflective teacher, with the skills, energy and resilience needed to make a real difference in schools. \r\n\r\nIn order to achieve Qualified Teacher Status, you will demonstrate that you are able to meet all the requirements of the Teachers’ Standards. This aspect of assessment is largely undertaken by your Professional Mentor in school and Liaison Tutor. Trainees will also be supported both by North West Learning Partnership and LJMU staff. On placement, they will undertake co-observations of your teaching and quality assure the school-based training across the Partnership. \r\n\r\nThe Postgraduate Certificate is assessed through 2 Modules. You will also complete a two-part essay, which requires you to reflect on your developing classroom practice.","interviewProcess":"All applicants who meet the entry requirements will be invited to attend an interview.  Interviews, when not on line, take place at one of the schools within the Three Saints Academy Trust. There will be at least two representatives from all our partners, including university, on the interview panel. The interview process includes a presentation based on a planned lesson and a formal interview. You will also be asked to complete a written English task and a Mathematics task. Further information will be provided prior to the interview. ","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Trainee teachers will be allocated a 'home' school in one of our placement schools for one academic year, all of which are outstanding or good. We provide a personalised and supportive training approach and therefore the location of your home school will be taken into consideration, in addition to the opportunity to work alongside Teaching for Mastery specialists, Maths PDLs and SLEs. You will have two Teaching Practice phases in your home school and one in your away school. The away school is a contrasting experience. We aim to allocate placements which are best fit for your development. You will have a Professional Mentor in both your home and away school who will support your development. You will also receive support and guidance from the School Direct Strategic Lead. \r\n\r\nIn addition to your home and away school, you also have a day placement in our partner High School, Special Schools and in Foundation Stage. We believe that these placements are important and enhance your training within the primary phase. ","personalQualities":"We are looking for individuals with a professional approach who will become positive members of the school community. Candidates should be able to demonstrate a passion for teaching and resilience. The ability to communicate clearly, fluently and accurately in spoken and written Standard English and strong organisational skills are essential. \r\nThe ability to articulate views on the principles and practice of education particularly as it relates to teaching of the Primary phase is also important. Good subject knowledge in Mathematics and a passion for teaching and developing Primary Mathematics. ","otherRequirements":"Experience in school prior to the training programme is not essential. However, we are happy to arrange experience in one of our partner schools, if you so wish. If you feel you would benefit from this, please email kathy.carman@three-saints.org.uk for further information.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:49:27.086Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-01T14:48:59.988Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2024"}
