In these sessions you will receive practical strategies and ideas to develop your practice within the classroom.  Areas of pedagogy covered within these sessions include: assessment for learning, smart marking, lesson planning, behaviour management and differentiation.  Our Non-Salaried and SCITT courses are awarded with QTS and PGCE carrying 60 masters credits (awarded in partnership with the University of Sussex).  Our salaried courses lead to QTS only.\r\nAlongside your General Professional Studies, all trainees receive subject specific training, which is led by one of the schools within the partnership. All subject hubs within the partnership have been chosen for their renowned reputation as training centres and outstanding levels of learning and teaching as well as results. History subject studies gives trainees a weekly dedicated session focusing on subject related topics, preparing you to teach History to a high level within the classroom. Areas of training include controlled assessments, planning an effective scheme of work, differentiation and progression as a historian enabling you to teach across the key stages. As a Teach SouthEast trainee you would spend the majority of time in your placement school with the weekly day of training delivered by the Teach SouthEast SCITT and their partnership of schools. The PGCE (60 masters credits) is delivered by and accredited by The University of Sussex, whose ITT provision has been graded as outstanding by Ofsted.  Trainees have the opportunity to go to The University of Sussex on a number of occasions throughout the year to access keynote lectures and the PGCE element of the course is delivered at one of the two lead schools within the SCITT. \r\n","interviewProcess":"Once we receive your application through UCAS we will make a call to interview within approximately one week. The interview day will be held at one of the schools within the partnership within approximately  two weeks. The interview day will consist of: \r\n•\tA tour of the school in which the interviews are being held\r\n•\tA subject knowledge test.  This is usually part of a GCSE paper and will last no longer than 30 minutes\r\n•\tAn exercise on resilience \r\n•\tTeaching an advised topic to a class of approximately 30 students for approximately 25 minutes\r\n•\tAn interview with staff from Teach SouthEast and our partner schools\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Teach SouthEast is a partnership of 15 schools around the SouthEast of England.  Placing trainees is a complex process and we take many factors into consideration when doing so.  These factors include: \r\n•\tEstablishing which schools in the partnership have the capacity to host a trainee in a particular subject\r\n•\tSelecting a mentor who will be the best fit for the trainee\r\n•\tWe will establish at interview where the candidate will be living for the course, if the candidate drives and if they have access to a car or if they will be dependent on public transport\r\n•\tWe do not expect trainees to travel for longer than an hour each way to their placement school.  Trainee journeys to their placement schools are typically between 20 – 40 minutes\r\n•\tWe always do our best to accommodate trainees’ personal circumstances when placing them.\r\nTrainees will spend the first term in their Home School.   After Christmas, trainees will be given a 6 week contrasting Away School placement until the February half term, after which they will return to their Home School.  \r\nAll of our Initial Teacher Training courses teach the age range 11-16 with post 16 enhancement so every trainee will get an exposure to teaching Key Stages 3, 4 and 5.  The only exceptions to this are Business Studies  and Media Studies which cover ages 14-19 as these subjects are not taught at Key Stage 3 in our partnership of schools.\r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking to recruit talented candidates who have the qualities and attributes suited to a career in teaching and the drive and ambition to make it happen.  These personal qualities include:\r\n\r\n•\tA friendly and approachable nature\r\n•\tGood interpersonal skills\r\n•\tOrganisation and time management\r\n•\tA passion for your subject \r\n•\tAn innate ability to communicate and relate to young people \r\n•\tA positive outlook and resilient nature\r\n•\tA creative and innovative approach\r\n•\tThe ability to reflect on and improve practice\r\n•\tPotential leadership capabilities\r\n•\tA passion and drive for delivering first class education.","otherRequirements":"All trainees are required to undergo an enhanced DBS check to verify your suitability for working with young people.  If you have lived overseas for more than 12 months in the past 10 years, you will need to provide an overseas police check.
