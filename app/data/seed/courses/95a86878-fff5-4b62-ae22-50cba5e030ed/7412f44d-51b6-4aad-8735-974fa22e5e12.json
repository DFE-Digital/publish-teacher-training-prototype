A dedicated Professional Studies programme takes place each week in the placement school.  In the spring term, there is a six-week second placement in a contrasting school setting usually one of the partnership schools.\r\n","interviewProcess":"The Interview process will involve an observation of the candidate teaching a class for 30 minutes with advance notice of the topic, year group and ability of the children that they will be teaching.  There will be a written exercise, and a panel interview lasting 30 minutes.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Trainees spend the majority of their year in a single school, but also complete a six-week placement in a contrasting school in January and February. All schools that form part of the Plume Community Teaching Partnership are judged at least as ‘Good’ and are within a twenty minute drive of the Lead School, Plume Academy.\r\n\r\nThe Partnership offers ample opportunity for trainees to gain experience of 11-16 and 11-18 teaching. \r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for innovative trainee teachers with a passion for working with children and a passion for their subject who will create in our pupils an appetite for learning, regardless of their ability.  This will usually be demonstrated by previous work experience in schools but might also encompass other settings where working with children from 11-18 has been a consistent aspect of the potential trainee's life.","otherRequirements":null,"status":2,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:46:52.385Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2023"}
