Schools and the university work together at every stage of the selection, training, and assessment of our beginner teachers. This long-standing relationship results in excellent support from experienced teachers mentoring trainees on placement and dedicated University tutors offering models of successful pedagogy.\r\n\r\nTrainees with disabilities and other needs\r\nThe University of Sussex Schools’ Partnership welcomes applications from any candidates who have the potential to make excellent teachers regardless of disability and additional needs. We have previously successfully supported trainee teachers with Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, Autism, Mental Health conditions and a range of physical, hearing, and visual impairments.\r\nAll candidates complete an online health questionnaire administered by the University's Occupational Health Department in the summer before beginning the course. This is to establish mental and physical fitness for teaching. Following this, if you have a disability or health condition, you are then advised to register with the University Student Support service and an assessment is arranged to establish your needs and to identify additional support and adjustments needed to help you be as successful as possible on the course. At all stages we strongly recommend trainees fully disclose their individual needs so a support package can be tailored to everyone.\r\n\r\nYou will attend a full-time three-week induction course on the university Campus during September to prepare you for starting your school placement with us towards the end of the month.\r\nFull-time candidates spend Monday to Thursday each week training in one of our partnership schools and attending the University Campus on Fridays for lectures, workshops, and seminars with our team of experienced subject tutors. Part-time candidates attend Sussex University on Fridays and train for two days a week in school in year 1 and three days in year 2.\r\nOver the year you will be placed in two different schools and required to pass both placements. Additional assessments are via a Masters level essay submitted in late February and an innovative Viva style Masters level exit interview at the end of the course.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sussex.ac.uk/education/ite/pgceandschooldirectsecondary/dt\r\n","interviewProcess":"Applicants who meet the entry requirements will be invited to a Sussex selection event either face to face or online via Zoom.
