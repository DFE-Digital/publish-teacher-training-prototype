The course has consistently been rated highly by former trainees and has been successful in a series of recent Ofsted inspections. Our PGCE Secondary programme is designed and taught jointly by the Southampton Education School in partnership with over 125 schools across the region in eight different subject areas, and has a very good track record of moving successful trainees into employment, locally and beyond. You’ll engage with research-led approaches to enhance the quality of teaching you can offer your students and begin your career with confidence. Two thirds of the PGCE is spent in two school placements, starting in October, under the guidance of curriculum mentors who are all experienced classroom teachers. One third is spent in university, under the guidance of curriculum tutors, who all have extensive school teaching experience. \r\n\r\nOur PGCE Secondary course will equip you with the necessary skills and knowledge to teach Physical Education across the secondary age range, including some opportunities to know more about 16-19 teaching. Candidates should note that the majority of schools in the Southampton partnership serve 11-16 cohorts and access to post-16 experience is limited to guest speakers, independent inquiries and observations in the main. The curriculum focuses both on the professional practice and inherent subject knowledge. Principles underpinning professional practice are delivered through each of the prescribed areas of Athletics, Dance, Games, Gymnastic, Outdoor and Adventurous Activities.\r\nIn a combined effort from the university and our partnership schools, to develop your subject knowledge in Physical Education through a range of approaches: workshops, seminars, lectures and demonstrations, simulations and micro-teaching activities, independent and group research. The central focus of the course is on teaching Physical Education in a challenging yet accessible way and understanding how children learn. The university based sessions often consist of practical workshops, where students can develop their Physical Education skills as well as learning the pedagogical knowledge needed to teach.\r\nIf you have an A level, grade C or above in an EBacc subject (English, Maths, Science, History, Geography or Languages) this enables you to train in a second subject alongside your PE PGCE. More information will be provided at interview if you are interested in this option.  \r\n\r\nPlease visit our website for further information: https://www.southampton.ac.uk/courses/physical-education-pgce\r\n","interviewProcess":"At interview, candidates will meet the tutor team and learn about key elements of the programme, including how trainees are supported and developed, how placements work and how trainees are assessed. Each candidate will give a short presentation related to their curriculum subject and will complete a written task followed by an individual interview with subject tutors.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You’ll be placed in schools for most of your course. This university is based in Southampton, and your school placements will be within commuting distance. Our partnership covers an extensive area, which enables us to offer a wide range of school experiences, from large urban secondary schools to smaller rural schools. You can’t pick which schools you want to be in, but your university will try to take your journey time into consideration.\r\n\r\nEach trainee undertakes two block placements in schools within our Partnership. We aim to provide schools that offer contrasting placement experiences in order to develop a breadth and range of skills. During the placement blocks, one day per week is dedicated to training with the university in either curriculum or professional development. A regular programme of school based professional training is also delivered whilst trainees are on placement. Whilst on placement, each trainee is allocated a mentor from their subject area and a professional mentor to oversee the professional training. Trainees will also receive visits from their university tutor to support them in their teaching and professional development.\r\n","personalQualities":"Please refer to our website for further information: https://www.southampton.ac.uk/courses/physical-education-pgce#entry","otherRequirements":"You will be required to obtain:\r\n* complete a form describing your state of health which will be checked against the DfE Fitness to Teach regulations \r\n* to provide an Enhanced Disclosure from the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) to confirm that there are no criminal offences on your record which should bar you from teaching.
