You will join a community of students at IM Marsh campus for University – based sessions, which begin with a Summer School during the last week of August.\r\n\r\nOur student teachers normally spend Fridays (and the occasional full week) at the University and the other 4 days in school. Later in the year, students return to the University for additional full training weeks, but spend the majority of time (at least 120 days) in schools.\r\n\r\nThe Art & Design  programme will focus predominantly on developing your subject knowledge and subject pedagogy so that you have the knowledge, understanding and skills needed to become a confident Art & Design teacher. University lead lectures and seminars will develop your confidence in a range of relevant issues; classroom and behaviour management; meeting individual needs and inclusion; planning and assessment etc. School – led sessions will also develop your understanding in key areas related to our school context. There is a strong emphasis on social justice issues in education and on mental health and well-being. We want you to develop into an inclusive and reflective teacher, with the skills, energy and resilience needed to make a real difference in schools.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve Qualified Teacher Status, you will demonstrate that you are able to meet all the requirements of the Teachers’ Standards. This aspect of assessment is largely undertaken by our school-based mentors. LJMU staff are in regular contact with all trainees on placement, undertake co-observations of their teaching and Quality Assure the school-based training across the Partnership.\r\n\r\nThe Postgraduate Certificate is assessed through 2 Modules. The Award of QTS is integral to one of these academic Modules. You will also complete one essay, in two parts which asks you to reflect on your practice.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Candidates who meet the criteria will be invited by email to attend a one-day selection process giving candidates the opportunity to show their potential for this course. Normally interviews will be held in a school based setting, but due to the current situation this may not be possible. Interviews may be conducted over the telephone and candidates will be informed of this.\r\n\r\nThere will be a number of activities to be undertaken on the day:\r\n\r\n* Deliver a 5 minute presentation to the interview panel.\r\n* Prepare and deliver a 30 minute lesson from your subject area, to a class of Key Stage 3 students.\r\n* Formal interview.\r\n\r\nThe selection process may or may not take place at your alliance school and candidates will normally be informed of the outcome within 24 hours.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Your school-based experience takes place largely in a Home School, supported by well- trained mentors. We have found that being in a Home School ensures that you are fully integrated into school life and get to know staff, pupils and your subject mentor extremely well, to the benefit of all involved. A member of LJMU staff is attached to each school and is responsible for visiting regularly in order to support all trainees and their mentors.\r\n\r\nAll trainees are entitled to weekly review and feedback meetings with their mentors and to tutorials with LJMU staff. This “wraparound” care ensures that you are consistently supported from start to finish, both personally and professionally.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the time spent in a Home School, you will also undertake an alternative placement of roughly 6 weeks in a contrasting school between January and February. This placement has an explicit focus on diversity and inclusion. Additional experiences are also often provided for instance through visits to Special Schools and to Primary Schools. Although the LJMU programmes focus on 11-16 experience, many trainees also gain experience of Post 16 planning and teaching during their school experience.\r\n\r\nSchool experience is structured in Phases, beginning with an observation phase, so that you can develop appropriate confidence and competence, only taking on greater responsibility for planning and teaching as the year progresses. Your final assessment for QTS is conducted at the end of the year.\r\n","personalQualities":"What we look for in a candidate:\r\n\r\n* Dedicated to the students.\r\n* Passionate and enthusiastic about teaching.\r\n* Eager, keen to learn and can reflect and plan.\r\n* Excellent organisational skills, punctual and willing to give your own time to the school and its students.\r\n* An ability to reflect on own practice, accept guidance and constructive criticism.\r\n* Guide and drive your own learning, use your initiative and be proactive.\r\n","otherRequirements":"You will also be required to meet the Department for Education’s standards for physical and mental fitness to teach and clearance to work with children. Further information, including a Declaration of Health questionnaire and details of how to apply for a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) Enhanced Disclosure will be sent to you after you have firmly accepted an offer.\r\n\r\nYour offer is conditional on completing ALL conditions of entry. These will be made available on UCAS.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:53:03.267Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-30T12:56:25.678Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2023"}
