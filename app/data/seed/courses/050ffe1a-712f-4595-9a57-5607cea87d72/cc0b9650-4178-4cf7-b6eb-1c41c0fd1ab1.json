You will join a community of students at LJMU for University – based sessions.\r\n\r\nOur student teachers usually spend Mondays (and sometimes the occasional full week) at the University and the other 4 days in school. Later in the year, students return to the University for additional full training weeks, but spend the majority of time (at least 120 days) in our Partnership schools.\r\n\r\nThe Primary Maths programme will focus predominantly on developing your subject knowledge and subject pedagogy in all primary curriculum subjects, so that you have the knowledge, understanding and skills needed to become a confident teacher. In addition, University-based lectures and seminars will develop your confidence in a range of relevant issues such as classroom and behaviour management, meeting individual needs and inclusion, planning and assessment etc. There is a strong emphasis on social justice issues in education and on mental health and well-being. We will support you to develop into an inclusive and reflective teacher, with the skills, energy and resilience needed to make a real difference in education.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve Qualified Teacher Status, you will demonstrate that you are able to meet all the requirements of the Teachers’ Standards by the end of the course.
