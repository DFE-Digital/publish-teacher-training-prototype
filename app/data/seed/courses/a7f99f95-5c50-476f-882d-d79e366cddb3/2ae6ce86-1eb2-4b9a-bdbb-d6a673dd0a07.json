The course requires a study of academic literature and completion of professional assignments, alongside two school based placements. The course is designed to show that trainee teachers demonstrate that they have met the standards for Qualified Teacher Status. \r\nThe course is ideal for those who have artistic flair and a passion to share this talent and enthusiasm with young people. Learning in a classroom requires professionalism, organisation, planning, preparation and excellent subject knowledge across the range of disciplines in Art and Design.  You will work alongside an experienced team of Art teachers, who have proven ability to ensure achievement for all students. Through the process of observation and team teaching opportunities, the ability to communicate and demonstrate concepts and skills will be developed. \r\nYou will also have the opportunity to develop a range of lessons and teaching styles that cover the practical delivery and assessment of Art at Key Stages 3, 4 and 5, where appropriate.\r\nYou receive a practice-led, hands on experience. Trainees are supported by a Subject Based Tutor within school, the Professional Tutor of the school, the Lead Subject Mentor from the NTTP SCITT, the Programme Facilitators.  Subject Studies and General Professional Study sessions enhance your knowledge of teaching and learning and help to develop your pedagogy.\r\nYou will spend the majority of your course in the classroom; working with dedicated professionals and fantastic students. This is the best place to learn the art of teaching. Your programme is designed to suit you, with your strengths nurtured and your areas for development targeted, improved upon and monitored. During your placements you will teach pupils in the 11 to 16 age range.  You will also experience PSHE and Citizenship delivery when acting as a form tutor.\r\n \r\nSubject Studies are delivered as twilight sessions and take place in the first half of the year so that you have the tools to succeed in your school placements. Sessions are delivered by your Lead Subject Mentor and other experienced teachers. \r\nA selection of subject studies sessions are as follows: \r\nCore Health and Safety Training\r\nManaging a practical art room\r\nDrawings skill – developing from KS3-5\r\nWatercolour workshop\r\nCeramics – modelling skills in a range of compliant materials\r\nPhotoshop workshop\r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"As with any interview, the key to success is preparation. Make sure you do your research into the course, as well as the issues surrounding education and teaching in general. Policies and practices change quickly, so your knowledge needs to be up to date.\r\nThe Interview process will entail: \r\n•\tAdministrative Questions \t\t\t\t-\t10 minutes\r\n•\tPresentation - “Why I want to become a teacher”\t-\t5 minutes\r\n•\tPresenting a ‘Starter’ of your choice\t\t\t-\t5 minutes\r\n•\tInterview \t\t\t\t\t\t-\t40 minutes\r\n•\tLiteracy written task\t\t\t\t- \t20 minutes\r\n•\tSubject Knowledge Task\t\t\t\t- \t30 minutes\r\n•\tPortfolio of work/video for Art and Performing Art subjects\r\n\r\nYour interviewers will be looking for you to demonstrate a number of qualities. You should therefore try to tailor your answers and contributions to reflect these qualities. They are:\r\n-\tA commitment to and understanding of secondary education and the role of the teacher\r\n-\tGood personal, intellectual and communication skills\r\n-\tA positive attitude towards children and working with children\r\n-\tAn enthusiasm for and understanding of your subject (s) and teaching in general.  \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We have long-established partnerships and rewarding connections with a wide variety of secondary schools across the county.  Ideally, you will be required to spend a minimum of 12 weeks in two of our placement schools whilst on the course.  You will work closely with our trained school based tutors receiving weekly one-to-one meetings to monitor your progress throughout your first and second placement.\r\nTo qualify for QTS we will provide trainees with enough time in schools to demonstrate that they have achieved all the Teachers’ Standards.\r\nYou will train with pupils in the 11 to 16 age range, however in many of our partnership schools there will be the opportunity to experience Post 16 Education too.\r\nYou will be allocated to your placement school as a result of an initial induction and skills audit conducted early in the course.  Your placement school will be identified to meet your needs and therefore may not be your nearest school.\r\n","personalQualities":"You must be flexible, resilient and motivated. Be able to demonstrate a clear enthusiasm for your subject and for teaching as a profession. You must have consistently high standards of professional and personal conduct and show tolerance and respect for the rights of others.
