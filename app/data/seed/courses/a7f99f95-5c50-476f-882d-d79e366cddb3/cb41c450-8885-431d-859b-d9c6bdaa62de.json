The course requires a study of academic literature and completion of professional assignments, alongside two school based placements. The course is designed to show that trainee teachers demonstrate that they have met the standards for Qualified Teacher Status. \r\n\r\nTraining to teach Social Sciences, you will be required to consider how you can develop student’s ability to become analytical and evaluative thinkers. Throughout the course you will be trained to devise creative and inspiring activities to teach theory, research and the methodology of the social sciences. A fundamental feature of your training will be creating your capacity to develop within students their ability to understand and apply learning in a scientific manner. You will learn how to engage and inspire your students through a wide range of strategies in order that they become independent critical thinkers. \r\n\r\nThe course will focus on training you to teach your main social science subject (usually psychology and/or sociology) at A level.  You will also be provided with the opportunity to develop your teaching practice in a second subject through teaching psychology at GCSE, alternatively there are opportunities to contribute to relevant vocational qualifications and Key Stage 3 humanities or science.\r\n\r\nYou will receive a practice-led, hands-on experience. Trainees are supported by a Subject Based Tutor within school, the Professional Tutor of the school and from the NTTP SCITT -  the Lead Subject Mentor and the Programme Facilitators.  \r\n\r\nSubject Studies and General Professional Study sessions enhance your knowledge of teaching and learning and help to develop your pedagogy.\r\nYou will spend the majority of your course in the classroom; working with dedicated professionals. This is the best place to learn the art of teaching.  During your placements you will teach pupils in the 11 to 18 age range.  \r\nSubject Studies are delivered as twilight sessions so that you have the tools to succeed in your school placements. Sessions are delivered by your Lead Subject Mentor and other experienced teachers. \r\nA selection of subject studies sessions are as follows:  \r\n•\tUnderstanding and teaching the maths requirement in Social Science\r\n•\tHow to teach outstanding and engaging key stage 4 lessons\r\n•\tAddressing the MIC question in Sociology \r\n•\tHow to deliver research methods effectively \r\n•\tHow to plan and teach lessons outside of your specialism\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"As with any interview, the key to success is preparation. Make sure you do your research into the course, as well as the issues surrounding education and teaching in general. Policies and practices change quickly, so your knowledge needs to be up to date.\r\nThe Interview process will entail: \r\n•\tAdministrative Questions \t\t\t\t-\t10 minutes\r\n•\tPresentation - “Why I want to become a teacher”\t-\t5 minutes\r\n•\tPresenting a ‘Starter’ of your choice\t\t\t-\t5 minutes\r\n•\tInterview \t\t\t\t\t\t-\t40 minutes\r\n•\tLiteracy written task\t\t\t\t- \t20 minutes\r\n•\tSubject Knowledge Task\t\t\t\t- \t30 minutes\r\n•\tPortfolio of work/video for Art and Performing Art subjects\r\n\r\nYour interviewers will be looking for you to demonstrate a number of qualities. You should therefore try to tailor your answers and contributions to reflect these qualities. They are:\r\n-\tA commitment to and understanding of secondary education and the role of the teacher\r\n-\tGood personal, intellectual and communication skills\r\n-\tA positive attitude towards children and working with children\r\n-\tAn enthusiasm for and understanding of your subject (s) and teaching in general.  \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We have long-established partnerships and rewarding connections with a wide variety of secondary schools across the county.  Ideally, you will be required to spend a minimum of 12 weeks in two of our placement schools whilst on the course.  You will work closely with our trained school based tutors receiving weekly one-to-one meetings to monitor your progress throughout your first and second placement.\r\nTo qualify for QTS we will provide trainees with enough time in schools to demonstrate that they have achieved all the Teachers’ Standards.\r\nYou will train with pupils in the 11 to 16 age range, however in many of our partnership schools there will be the opportunity to experience Post 16 Education too.\r\nYou will be allocated to your placement school as a result of an initial induction and skills audit conducted early in the course.  Your placement school will be identified to meet your needs and therefore may not be your nearest school.\r\n","personalQualities":null,"otherRequirements":null,"status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:53:09.941Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-29T14:53:38.668Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2023"}
