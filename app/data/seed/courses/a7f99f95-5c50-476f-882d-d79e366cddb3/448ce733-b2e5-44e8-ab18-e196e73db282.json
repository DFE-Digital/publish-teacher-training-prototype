Our course requires a study of academic literature and completion of professional assignments, alongside two school based placements. It is designed to give trainees the opportunity to demonstrate that they have met the standards for Qualified Teacher Status. \r\n\r\nThe course is perfect for those who find Mathematics exciting and challenging, who are able to share this enthusiasm with young people. To be successful, trainees need to watch and learn from other teachers and then deliver in a style that suits their own personality. Learning in a classroom requires professionalism, organisation, planning, preparation and excellent subject knowledge.  Trainees will experience lessons across a range of ages and attainment, reflecting the diverse needs of students in our schools. They will work alongside an experienced team of Mathematicians, who have proven ability to ensure achievement for all students. Through the process of observation and team teaching opportunities the ability to communicate key mathematical concepts and skills will be developed. \r\n\r\nYou will spend the majority of your course in the classroom; working with dedicated professionals. This is the best place to learn the art of teaching. During your placements you will teach pupils in the 11-16 age range. You will receive a practice-led, hands on experience. Trainees are supported by a Subject Based Tutor and Professional Tutor within school; the Lead Subject Mentor from the NTTP SCITT and the Programme Facilitators. General Professional Study sessions enhance your knowledge of teaching and learning and help to develop your pedagogy. Constant self-reflection allows trainees to assess their strengths and development potential, which allows progression and confidence.\r\n\r\nSubject Studies are delivered as twilight sessions and take place in the first half of the year so that you have the tools to succeed in your school placements. They are bespoke sessions reflecting the needs of a Maths teacher, designed to illustrate ways to help you apply your knowledge and understanding in designing and teaching lessons. Sessions are delivered by your Lead Subject Mentor and other experienced teachers. \r\nA selection of subject studies sessions are as follows: \r\n\r\n\tChanges in the curriculum\r\n\tDeveloping positive attitudes to Maths\r\n\tMarking effectively\r\n\tPlanning and preparing an effective Maths lesson\r\n\tPost 16 Maths and how it links with GCSE\r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"As with any interview, the key to success is preparation. Make sure you do your research into the course, as well as the issues surrounding education and teaching in general. Policies and practices change quickly, so your knowledge needs to be up to date.\r\nThe Interview process will entail: \r\n•\tAdministrative Questions \t\t\t\t-\t10 minutes\r\n•\tPresentation - “Why I want to become a teacher”\t-\t5 minutes\r\n•\tPresenting a ‘Starter’ of your choice\t\t\t-\t5 minutes\r\n•\tInterview \t\t\t\t\t\t-\t40 minutes\r\n•\tLiteracy written task\t\t\t\t- \t20 minutes\r\n•\tSubject Knowledge Task\t\t\t\t- \t30 minutes\r\n•\tPortfolio of work/video for Art and Performing Art subjects\r\n\r\nYour interviewers will be looking for you to demonstrate a number of qualities. You should therefore try to tailor your answers and contributions to reflect these qualities. They are:\r\n-\tA commitment to and understanding of secondary education and the role of the teacher\r\n-\tGood personal, intellectual and communication skills\r\n-\tA positive attitude towards children and working with children\r\n-\tAn enthusiasm for and understanding of your subject (s) and teaching in general.  \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We have long-established partnerships and rewarding connections with a wide variety of secondary schools across the county.  Ideally, you will be required to spend a minimum of 12 weeks in two of our placement schools whilst on the course.  You will work closely with our trained school based tutors receiving weekly one-to-one meetings to monitor your progress throughout your first and second placement.\r\nTo qualify for QTS we will provide trainees with enough time in schools to demonstrate that they have achieved all the Teachers’ Standards.\r\nYou will train with pupils in the 11 to 16 age range, however in many of our partnership schools there will be the opportunity to experience Post 16 Education too.\r\nYou will be allocated to your placement school as a result of an initial induction and skills audit conducted early in the course.  Your placement school will be identified to meet your needs and therefore may not be your nearest school.\r\n","personalQualities":null,"otherRequirements":null,"status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:53:09.715Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-29T14:45:16.531Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2023"}
