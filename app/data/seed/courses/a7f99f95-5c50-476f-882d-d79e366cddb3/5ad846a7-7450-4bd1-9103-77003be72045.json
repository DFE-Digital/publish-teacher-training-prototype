The course requires a study of academic literature and completion of professional assignments, alongside two school based placements. The course is designed to show that trainee teachers demonstrate that they have met the standards for Qualified Teacher Status. \r\n\r\nWhen you study Music on the NTTP programme you receive a practice-led, hands on experience. You will spend the majority of your course in the classroom; working with dedicated professionals and fantastic students. This is the best place to learn the art of teaching and you will be amazed at the speed at which your teaching develops. Your programme is designed to suit you, with your strengths nurtured and your areas for development targeted, improved upon and monitored. \r\n\r\nDuring your placements you will teach pupils in the 11 to 16 age range, however, in many of our partnership schools there will be the opportunity to experience Post 16 Education too. \r\n\r\nTrainees are supported by a Subject Based Tutor within school, the Professional Tutor of the school, the Lead Subject Mentor from the NTTP SCITT, the Programme Facilitators. \r\n\r\nSubject Studies and General Professional Study sessions enhance your knowledge of teaching and learning and help to develop your pedagogy. Constant self-reflection allows trainees to assess their strengths and development potential, which should allow progression and confidence.\r\nYou will spend the majority of your course in the classroom; working with dedicated professionals and fantastic students.

Sessions are delivered by your Lead Subject Mentor and other experienced teachers from within partnership schools.

Policies and practices change quickly, so your knowledge needs to be up to date.\r\nThe Interview process will entail: \r\n•\tAdministrative Questions \t\t\t\t-\t10 minutes\r\n•\tPresentation - “Why I want to become a teacher”\t-\t5 minutes\r\n•\tPresenting a ‘Starter’ of your choice\t\t\t-\t5 minutes\r\n•\tInterview \t\t\t\t\t\t-\t40 minutes\r\n•\tLiteracy written task\t\t\t\t- \t20 minutes\r\n•\tSubject Knowledge Task\t\t\t\t- \t30 minutes\r\n•\tPortfolio of work/video for Art and Performing Art subjects\r\n\r\nYour interviewers will be looking for you to demonstrate a number of qualities.
