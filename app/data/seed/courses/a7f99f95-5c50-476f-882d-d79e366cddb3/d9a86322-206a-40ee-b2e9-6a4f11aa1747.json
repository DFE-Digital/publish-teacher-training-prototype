This course will give you the knowledge and understanding needed to teach at least two specialisms to KS3 and one at KS4 level.  During school placements it is likely that you will gain exposure to at least 3 areas such as Resistant Materials, Food and Textiles.  Your choice should reflect your previous qualifications/experience and subject knowledge. The course will give you the necessary qualifications required to teach in the workshop and/or Food room.  Trainees will leave with a core Health & Safety Certificate, extension levels on the required specialist equipment (Resistant Materials) and a Basic Food Hygiene Certificate (Food Tech).  \r\n\r\nDuring placements you will gain exposure to at least 3 areas. The course requires completion of professional assignments, alongside two school based placements. The course is designed in line with the ITT Core Content Framework with focus on Behaviour Management, Pedagogy, Curriculum, Assessment and Professional Behaviours.  By the end of the course trainee teachers must meet the Teachers Standards in full.  \r\n\r\nAs a trainee teacher you are encouraged to reflect on what constitutes an effective lesson before demonstrating your ability to apply this knowledge in practice. \r\n\r\nYou will receive a practice-led, hands-on experience. Trainees are supported by a Subject Based Tutor and Professional Tutor within school, and Lead Subject Mentor and Programme Facilitators from the NTTP SCITT.  You will attend Subject Studies and General Professional Study sessions to enhance your knowledge of teaching and learning and help to develop your pedagogy. \r\n\r\nThe majority of your course is spent in the classroom; working with dedicated professionals. This is the best place to learn the art of teaching.  The programme is designed to suit you, with your strengths nurtured and your areas for development targeted, improved upon and monitored. \r\nDuring your placements you will teach pupils in the 11 to 16 age range but you may have the opportunity to see post-16 teaching.\r\n \r\nSubject Studies are delivered as twilight sessions throughout the course, There is a heavy practical element to these sessions so that you have the tools to succeed in your school placements. Sessions are delivered by your Lead Subject Mentor and other experienced teachers. \r\n \r\n ","interviewProcess":"As with any interview, the key to success is preparation. Make sure you do your research into the course, as well as the issues surrounding education and teaching in general. Policies and practices change quickly, so your knowledge needs to be up to date. An awareness of the GCSE specifications is expected.\r\n\r\nThe Interview process will entail: \r\n•\tAdministrative Questions \t\t\t\t-\t10 minutes\r\n•\tPresentation - “Why I want to become a teacher”\t-\t5 minutes\r\n•\tPresenting a ‘Starter’ of your choice\t\t\t-\t5 minutes\r\n•\tInterview \t\t\t\t\t\t-\t40 minutes\r\n•\tLiteracy written task\t\t\t\t- \t20 minutes\r\n•\tSubject Knowledge Task\t\t\t\t- \t30 minutes\r\n•\tPortfolio of work/video for Design Technology subjects\r\n\r\nYour interviewers will be looking for you to demonstrate a number of qualities. You should therefore try to tailor your answers and contributions to reflect these qualities. They are:\r\n\r\n-\tA commitment to and understanding of secondary education and the role of the teacher\r\n-\tGood personal, intellectual and communication skills\r\n-\tA positive attitude towards children and working with children\r\n-\tAn enthusiasm for and understanding of your subject (s) and teaching in general.  \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We have long-established partnerships and rewarding connections with a wide variety of secondary schools across the county.  Ideally, you will be required to spend a minimum of 12 weeks in two of our placement schools whilst on the course.  You will work closely with our trained school based tutors receiving weekly one-to-one meetings to monitor your progress throughout your first and second placement.\r\nTo qualify for QTS we will provide trainees with enough time in schools to demonstrate that they have achieved all the Teachers’ Standards.\r\nYou will train with pupils in the 11 to 16 age range, however in many of our partnership schools there will be the opportunity to experience Post 16 Education too.\r\nYou will be allocated to your placement school as a result of an initial induction and skills audit conducted early in the course.
