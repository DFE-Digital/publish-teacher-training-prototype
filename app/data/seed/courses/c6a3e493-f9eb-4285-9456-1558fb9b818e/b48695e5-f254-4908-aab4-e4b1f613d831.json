In addition to being an academic course, the PGCE Secondary programme provides a professional qualification (QTS).  By the end of the course you should have achieved the Teachers' Standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and be confident in teaching all aspects of the Secondary National Curriculum at ages 11-16.   You will become a reflective practitioner who will be able to improve continuously your own knowledge, understanding and skills.\r\n\r\nThe PGCE programme is 44 weeks long, commencing early September, with time divided between school placements and Bradford College.  The course prepares you to teaching within secondary age range (11-16).\r\n\r\nYou will study all areas of the secondary curriculum and link practice to theory, completing 3 modules at Level 7.  Bradford College sessions are relevant, often practically-based, and address the subject knowledge, teaching techniques (pedagogy) and professional issues required to teach children accessing the Secondary National Curriculum.\r\n\r\nCollege sessions cover aspects such as planning and assessment, behaviour management, SEND, inclusion and safeguarding.  In addition to this you have the support of subject specialist tutors, all of who have secondary teaching experience.\r\n\r\nFor the award of the PGCE you complete three assessed modules, each worth 20 Credit points at Masters Level.  These are:\r\n\r\n* Subject Specialist Pedagogy\r\n* Teaching, Learning and Assessment\r\n* Educational Philosophy and Vision\r\n\r\nThe assessment of these modules comprises a range of strategies, including essays, academic posters and presentations.  The PGCE qualification is validated by the University of Bolton.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the course you will meet the required standard for newly qualified teachers (NQTs).  Your knowledge and understanding of teaching in Secondary schools will be secure.  You will be capable of planning, teaching and managing a class and your monitoring, assessment, recording and reporting skills will be well developed.  You will understand the issues of accountability and the many professional responsibilities required of a teacher.

Further information will be provided if you are selected for interview.\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"School experience is a vital part of your teacher training programme.  A key strength of the PGCE course is how theory and practice are related by working with children in two placement schools - at least 120 days are school-based with support provided by experienced school mentors and College link tutors.\r\n\r\nYou will experience two contrasting placements, the first starting in the autumn term and the second starting in the spring term.  The remainder of the time will be spent in Bradford College and or in other educational settings.\r\n\r\nYour placements will be arranged for you.  Every effort is made to ensure that the most appropriate placements are chosen for each trainee to enhance their professional development.  We have strong partnership links with local schools, whose staff make a significant contribution to your training.  Partnership schools are situated in Bradford and the neighbouring LEAs to give a wide range of experience and to meet the needs of students from across the region.\r\n\r\nEach placement begins with a patter of serial days including periods of observation, work with small groups of children and the completion of school-based tasks.  Serial days lead to blocks of teaching practice with whole classes.\r\n\r\nProgress towards achieving Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) is assessed using the Teachers' Standards (DfE 2013) whilst in placement.  You will need to accumulate and record evidence in your Individual Development Profile (IDP) to demonstrate, by the end of the course, that you have met all of the Teachers' Standards and criteria in order that the College may recommend you for QTS.  \r\n","personalQualities":"Good literacy and numeracy skills, with the ability to communicate clearly and accurately in spoken and written Standard English\r\n\r\nPassion to work in a challenging and rewarding career \r\n\r\nA desire to develop your skills\r\n\r\nTime management skills\r\n\r\nPotential to work as a team member \r\n\r\nAwareness of contemporary education issues and multicultural issues in education\r\n","otherRequirements":"A satisfactory new DBS Disclosure will be required for the start of the course, which must be applied for through Bradford College.\r\n\r\nA health check is required before commencing on the course.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:39.398Z","updatedAt":"2021-08-23T21:04:25.461Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"}
