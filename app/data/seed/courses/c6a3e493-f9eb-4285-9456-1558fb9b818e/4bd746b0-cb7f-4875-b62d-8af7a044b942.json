On completion you should have achieved the Teachers’ Standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and be confident in teaching all aspects of the Early Years and Primary National Curriculum at the appropriate level.  You will become a reflective practitioner, able to improve continuously your own knowledge, understanding and skills.  \r\n\r\nThe 44 week PGCE programme commences early September, with time divided between school placements and Bradford College, preparing you to teach within the primary age range (3-11) on your chosen age route; 3-7, 5-11 or 7-11.\r\n\r\nYou study all areas of the primary curriculum and link practice to theory, completing 3 modules at Level 7.   You will also develop your skills in relation to the progression children make within mathematics from Foundation stage through to Year 6. The programme is based on current research in relation to the teaching and learning of mathematics, allowing you to gain a deep understanding of how children learn mathematics, and barriers to their learning.  You will gain an enhanced understanding of Teaching for Mastery (the 5 big ideas) and critically reflect on these strategies in relation to theory and classroom practice.  You will analyse the use of assessment in the teaching and learning of mathematics and reflect critically on the impact of strategies.\r\n\r\nEducation and Professional Studies (EPS) sessions cover aspects such as planning and assessment, child development, behaviour management, SEND, inclusion and safeguarding.  Your EPS Tutor will also be your individual tutor, monitoring your progress, with additional support from subject specialist tutors.\r\n\r\nFor the award of the PGCE you complete three assessed modules, each worth 20 Credit points at Masters Level.  These are:\r\n\r\nModule 1: Theories That Underpin Teaching and Learning\r\nModule 2: Teaching, Learning and Assessment\r\nModule 3: Educational Philosophy and Vision.\r\n\r\nModule assessment is through essays, an action plan and rationale based on your first placement, academic posters and presentations.  The PGCE is validated by the University of Bolton.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the course you will meet the required standards for newly qualified teachers (NQTs). Your knowledge and understanding of teaching in Primary schools will be secure. You will be capable of planning, teaching and managing a class and your monitoring, assessment, recording and reporting skills will be well developed.  You will understand the issues of accountability and the many professional responsibilities required of a teacher.\r\n","interviewProcess":"The overall aim of the selection procedure is to explore your potential to be an excellent primary mathematics teacher.\r\n\r\nInterviews are held as part of group sessions at which you will be asked to undertake a number of tasks: an interview, a presentation, a mathematics audit, written task and a short mathematics test.\r\n\r\nThere will be a group introduction at which you will be given a brief outline of the course and of your expected commitment in terms of attendance, professional behaviour and information about school placements.\r\n\r\n•\tYou will have an individual interview with tutor, lasting about 30 minutes, to assess your strengths, suitability for the course and for primary teaching.\r\n\r\n•\tYour presentation will be to a tutor and a small group of other candidates.  You are asked to bring an object and to talk for 4 to 5 minutes, telling us how and why you would use your object to stimulate children’s learning.  You should cover how you would use the resource to support learning and teaching, and what learning outcomes you might expect. \r\n\r\n•\tThe written task is a short comprehension task in Standard English, lasting 30 minutes, to evaluate your ability to communicate in writing.  \r\n\r\n•\tThe mathematics task is a short electronic test, lasting 30 minutes, to evaluate your understanding of basic arithmetic up to Key Stage 3 level.  \r\n\r\n•\tA specific Maths audit will be completed to ascertain areas of strength and areas for development.\r\n\r\nInterview sessions take approximately 3 hours in total.\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"School experience is a vital part of your teacher training programme.  A key strength of the PGCE course is how theory and practice are related by working with children in two placement schools – at least 120 days are school-based with support provided by experienced school mentors and College link tutors.\r\n\r\nYou will experience two contrasting placements, the first starting in the autumn term and the second starting in the spring term.  In addition to this,  PGCE Primary Mathematics students  will have an additional short placement within an alternative key stage they have not yet experienced, to enable them to gain an understanding of a broader range of mathematics delivery and knowledge. The remainder of the time will be spent in Bradford College and or in other educational settings.\r\n\r\nYour placements will be arranged for you according to the age route that you chose:  3-7, 5-11 or 7-11. Every effort is made to ensure that the most appropriate placements are chosen for each trainee to enhance their professional development.  We have strong partnership links with local schools, whose staff make a significant contribution to your training. Partnership schools are situated in Bradford and the neighbouring LEAs to give a wide range of experience and to meet the needs of students from across the region.\r\n\r\nEach placement begins with a pattern of serial days including periods of observation, work with small groups of children and the completion of school-based tasks. Serial days lead to blocks of teaching practice with whole classes.  \r\n\r\nProgress towards achieving Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) is assessed using the Teachers’ Standards (DfE 2013) whilst in placement.  You will need to accumulate and record evidence in your Individual Development Profile (IDP) to demonstrate, by the end of the course, that you have met all of the Teachers’ Standards and criteria in order that the College may recommend you for QTS. \r\n\r\nWe also use our extensive contacts with local schools for day visits during the modules of the course.  These ‘Curriculum in Action’ days focus on how specific elements of the National Curriculum are taught in schools.\r\n","personalQualities":"•\tA passion to work in a challenging and rewarding career\r\n•\tA desire and ability to develop your skills\r\n•\tPotential to work as a team member\r\n•\tGood literacy and numeracy skills, with the ability to communicate clearly and accurately in spoken and written Standard English\r\n•\tICT competence\r\n•\tKnowledge of national curriculum subjects\r\n•\tAwareness of contemporary education issues\r\n•\tExperience of working with children, particularly experience within primary school settings of the teaching and learning of mathematics.  You should be able to reflect on your experience when answering questions at interview. \r\n","otherRequirements":"You must have passed the professional skills tests in literacy and numeracy before the start of the course.  Further information on these is available at: http://sta.education.gov.uk/\r\n\r\nA satisfactory new DBS Disclosure will be required for the start of the course, which must be applied for through Bradford College.\r\n\r\nA health check is required before commencing on the course.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:39.081Z","updatedAt":"2021-08-23T21:17:59.308Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"}
