Every effort is made to ensure that the most appropriate placements are chosen for each trainee to enhance their professional development.  We have strong partnership links with local schools, whose staff make a significant contribution to your training.  Partnership schools are situtated in Bradford and the neighbouring LEAs to give a wide range of experience and to meet the needs of students from across the region.\r\n\r\nEach placement begins with a pattern of serial days including periods of observation, work with small groups of children and the completion of school-based tasks.  Serial days lead to blocks of teaching practice with whole classes.\r\n\r\nProgress towards achieving Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) is assessed using the Teachers' Standards (DfE 2013) whilst in placement.  You will need to accumulate and record evidence in your Individual Development Profile (IDP) to demonstrate, by the end of the course, that you have met all of the Teachers' Standards and criteria in order that the College may recommend you for QTS.\r\n","personalQualities":"Evidence of being an 'active citizen' - We will consider favourably candidates with:\r\n•\texperience of engagement, professionally or voluntarily, as 'active citizens'; e.g. community involvement, voluntary work, social and/or political campaigning\r\n•\tappropriate qualifications who want to transfer from careers in areas such as legal and welfare advice or youth and community work. \r\n\r\nGood literacy and numeracy skills, with the ability to communicate clearly and accurately in spoken and written Standard English\r\nAwareness of contemporary education issues and multicultural issues in education\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"A satisfactory new DBS Disclosure will be required for the start of the course, which must be applied for through Bradford College.\r\n\r\nA health check is required before commencing on the course.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:39.364Z","updatedAt":"2021-08-23T20:51:51.185Z","cycle":"2023","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"}
