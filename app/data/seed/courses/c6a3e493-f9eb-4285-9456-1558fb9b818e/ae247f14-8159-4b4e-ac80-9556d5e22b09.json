A key strength of the PGCE course is how theory and practice are related by working with children in two placement schools - at least 120 days are school-based with support provided by experienced school mentors and College link tutors.\r\n\r\nYou will experience two contrasting placements, the first starting in the autumn term and the second starting in the spring term.  The reaminder of the time will be spent  in Bradford College and or in other educational settings.\r\n\r\nYour placements will be arranged for you in the age range 11-16.  Every effort is made to ensure that the most appropriate placements are chosen for each trainee to enhance their professional development.  We have strong partnership links with local schools, whose staff make a significant contribution to your training.  Partnership schools are situated in Bradford and the neighbouring LEAs to give a wide range of experience and to meet the needs of students from across the region.\r\n\r\nEach placement begins with a pattern of serial days including periods of observation, work with small groups of children and the completion of school-based tasks.  Serial days lead to blocks of teaching practice with whole classes.\r\n\r\nProgress towards achieving Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) is assessed using the Teachers' Standards (DfE 2013) whilst in placement.  You will need to accumulate and record evidence in your Individual Development Profile (IDP) to demonstrate, by the end of the course, that you have met all of the Teachers' Standards and criteria in order that the College may recommend you for QTS.\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"Passion to work in a challenging and rewarding career \r\nGood literacy and numeracy skills, with the ability to communicate clearly and accurately in spoken and written Standard English\r\nKnowledge of the three science subjects - although specialising in one subject (Biology, Chemistry or Physics) at 'A' level, trainees are expected to be able to teach all three subjects to GCSE standard.\r\nTime management skills\r\nPotential to work as a team member \r\nAwareness of contemporary education issues\r\nAwareness of multicultural issues in education\r\n","otherRequirements":"A satisfactory new DBS Disclosure will be required for the start of the course, which must be applied for through Bradford College.\r\n\r\nA health check is required before commencing on the course.\r\n\r\nOnline, distance learning Subject Knowledge Enhancement (SKE) courses are available for Chemistry.
