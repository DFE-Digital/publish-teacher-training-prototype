It teaches pupils about events in both the natural and human worlds and how these two worlds are interlinked. It has an important role to play in developing an understanding of key global issues and helping pupils understand that there are a variety of perspectives from which these issues can be viewed. Geography, therefore, has important links to citizenship – we are all global citizens, with responsibilities to the planet and to each other. The information covered within the KS3 specification allows pupils access to a broad and balanced curriculum, in order to support pupils undertaking option choices and specialising in GCSE Geography.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Applications are made through UCAS.
