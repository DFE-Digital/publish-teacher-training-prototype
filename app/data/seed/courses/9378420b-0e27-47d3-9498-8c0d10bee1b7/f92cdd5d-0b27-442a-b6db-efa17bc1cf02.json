Enabling you to motivate, engage and inform pupils.\r\n\r\nOur studies are structured around Computing in the NC and consider the needs of teachers, the needs of pupils in schools and colleges, school requirements, and the requirements of commerce and industry. \r\n\r\nThe course content includes the understanding and application of the following: –\r\n\r\n(1) the fundamental principles and concepts of computer science and of computational thinking, including abstraction; decomposition; critical thinking; logical reasoning; algorithms and data representation.\r\n(2) The analysis of problems in computational terms, through the practical experience of solving such problems – including designing, writing, and debugging computer programs.\r\n(3) Gaining knowledge of a variety of software applications and programming languages, using a practical approach. Typical languages range might be Java, C, Visual Basic, Scratch, Python, ASP, Pascal, Logo, and development tools would include Access, App makers, Visual Studio, Macromedia Studio, and Movie Maker, dependent on your placement schools.\r\n(4) how to harness the power of modern technology and think creatively, analytically, critically and logically, in order to devise novel solutions to problems:\r\nModern problem solution = critical thinking plus computing power\r\n(5) the components that make up the different types of digital system and how they communicate with each other and with other systems\r\n(6) the impact of technology, relative to both the individual and also to wider society\r\n(7) Of mathematical skills relative to the computer science e.g. binary number system.\r\n\r\nThe course also considers the following pedagogical aspects:\r\nExam technique: looking in some detail at how we prepare our students for their exams and practical tasks, how pupils are assessed, and how to manage and record assessments efficiently. As a computer expert, you will be encouraged to develop your own expertise in the use of Digital Technologies.\r\n\r\nYou will be encouraged to create a dynamic and creative atmosphere within your classroom, given insight into how to work well in a practical environment and how to make use of other qualified adults. To help create such an environment, you need to be both enthusiastic and well organised!\r\n\r\nThese sessions are delivered at The OAKS at Keele University.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Our selection process is a two way process where you can find out if the OAKS is the training programme for you and we can decide if you can potentially become a good/outstanding secondary teacher.  We always carry out our interviews in one of our partnership schools, where you will be expected to teach either a class or a small group of their students for 15 minutes.  The students give us feedback on your lesson, which we share with you during a formal interview.  This focuses on your lesson, your subject knowledge and your commitment to teach.  There are also written tasks for you to complete; these include a written subject specific activity and a generic writing task.  The whole process should take no more than half a day at the school.  You are interviewed by partnership school staff and OAKS tutors, who will talk through the programme and school placements. There will always be plenty of time for you to ask questions and the decision as to whether you are accepted on to the course is usually made on the same day (this may vary depending on the subject/time of year).\r\n\r\nWe want the interview to be a very positive experience for you. Please arrive promptly and formal dress is expected.  We look forward to meeting you!\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We will send you to two secondary schools where you will receive an 11-16 experience; the length of time spent in both of these placements is the same.  Hopefully they will give you two very different experiences; one maybe in a small town or rural setting the other could be in an inner city.  We make sure that you also receive a pre and post phase enhancement so you will be placed in a primary school for one week and gain experience in a post-16 environment (possibly in one of your secondary placements).  We are very proud of our alternative education placements that we arrange for you on our programme.  Hopefully you will gain experience in an EAL school, pupil referral unit (PRU), special school and maybe an independent school.  \r\n\r\nTravel to and from your placements is always a key concern and we make every effort to make sure that you can easily commute to your schools.  We have a very large partnership in over five counties; one will have schools close to you.  We guarantee that you will never have to travel more than 75 minutes.  In fact, most of our trainees travel well under an hour to their teaching experiences.  When we visit our EAL schools we put on mini buses so nothing could be simpler.\r\n\r\nMany of you will have applied to one of our 5 hubs (geographical zones); this usually dictates the schools that you will be placed in.  Through evaluations all of our partnership schools are deemed to be at least \"very good training experiences\" for our trainee teachers.  We train and then monitor all of our school based mentors and the quality of our school’s provision annually; so rest assured that you will have a good teaching experience with us at the OAKS.\r\n","personalQualities":"* Highly motivated individuals who want to make a positive contribution to the education of young people.       \r\n* Trainees who are passionate about their own specialism subject, with very good subject knowledge.  \r\n* Trainees who are able to inspire their learners and create an environment where everyone wants to succeed.       \r\n* Candidates who show enthusiasm and a willingness to participate in all aspects of the training course.       \r\n* Robust, resilient applicants who want to make a difference in the classroom.       \r\n* People who want to become good or outstanding classroom practitioners, with a desire to improve themselves and their students.\r\n","otherRequirements":"o\ta medical report which is deemed satisfactory;\r\no\ta completed DBS enhanced disclosure which is deemed satisfactory by The OAKS;\r\no\tsuccessful completion of a minimum of 10 days teaching experience in a secondary school/college during the last two years. This could be either before or after selection (undertaking this before the selection process commences will strengthen your application).\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:49:03.394Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-28T10:36:11.076Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2024"}
