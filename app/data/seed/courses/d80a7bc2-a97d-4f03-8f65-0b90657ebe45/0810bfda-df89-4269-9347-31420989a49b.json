It covers all National Curriculum subjects and key aspects of primary education such as behaviour management, SEND and assessment. Trainees also have sessions focused on the two assignments and one presentation which contribute to their PGCE qualification (including 60 credits at M Level).\r\n\r\nAll trainees have a tutor who is committed to supporting each trainee over their training year.  This includes visits to observe teaching and end of term progress interviews.","interviewProcess":"The Primary SCITT team will be co-ordinating the recruitment process with partnership school head teachers. \r\n\r\nYou will be invited to a task day where you will undertake a short written activity to gauge your fundamental English skills and a group task focused on interpersonal skills.  \r\n\r\nThis will be followed by an interview that will begin with you giving a short presentation.\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"When applying for the salaried route, you need to have the support of a school that can offer you a placement, including paying your salary.  \r\n\r\nTrainees spend approximately 29 weeks on school placement.

You must be organised and self-motivated as although you will be well supported, you also need to be focused on the commitment involved within this training year.  \r\n","otherRequirements":"Confirmation of clear enhanced DBS check before you start the course. This check is carried out by your employing school but Primary SCITT do need to check your identity before starting the course.  \r\n\r\nMeet the 'Fit to Teach' criteria.
