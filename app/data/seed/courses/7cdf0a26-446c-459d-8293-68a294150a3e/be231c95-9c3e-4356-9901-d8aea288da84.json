Please note Visa sponsorship is possible but not guaranteed for international candidates.\r\n\r\nSchool Direct differs from University based PGCE in that you apply to the teaching school through UCAS and you will be told which school you will be based in. This allows you to ensure that you can organise travel arrangements, childcare and other commitments you may have alongside studying for the PGCE. You will still obtain a PGCE qualification at the end. In addition because it is school based it means that you will be in school from day one, so when staff return in September you join them at the staff INSET, which allows you to see how class teachers set out their lesson plans and routines for their new classes.\r\n \r\nYour training is managed by TESLA and delivered in collaboration with our partner Universities. This ensures you have a trio of support, from your school mentor, TESLA professional tutor and University link tutor. Currently this comprises of 15 days of alliance-based training where each Thursday you travel to a different school within the alliance for a different training theme. You are then also released to attend University days where you are often taught alongside their PGCE. Please be aware that each University has different set ups, lecture timetables and course end dates. If you are unsure about this and the travel commitment involved please ensure that, you ask about this on School Experience or Interview.\r\n","interviewProcess":"How We Select Our Trainees\r\nKey information and main stages of processing\r\n\r\n1.Apply through the UCAS site.
