Please see University websites for further details.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that International student’s fees are different and are not always eligible for Bursary support. This means it is likely that your training course will be self-funded. In terms of bursaries it is your responsibility to check what you are entitled to based on your qualifications you have. Alternatively, there is a salaried route, please enquire if this is available for your subject/school. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n","aboutCourse":"The School Direct programme is a one-year, Postgraduate route into teaching that allows you to graduate with 1) a wealth of classroom experience, 2) a full PGCE (Postgraduate Certificate in Education), and 3) Qualified Teacher Status.\r\n\r\nThe School Direct programme is open to domestic and international students. Please note Visa sponsorship is possible but not guaranteed for international candidates.\r\n\r\nSchool Direct differs from University based PGCE in that you apply to the teaching school through UCAS and you will be told which school you will be based in. This allows you to ensure that you can organise travel arrangements, childcare and other commitments you may have alongside studying for the PGCE. You will still obtain a PGCE qualification at the end. In addition because it is school based it means that you will be in school from day one, so when staff return in September you join them at the staff INSET, which allows you to see how class teachers set out their lesson plans and routines for their new classes.\r\n \r\nYour training is managed by TESLA and delivered in collaboration with our partner Universities. This ensures you have a trio of support, from your school mentor, TESLA professional tutor and University link tutor. Currently this comprises of 15 days of alliance-based training where each Thursday you travel to a different school within the alliance for a different training theme. You are then also released to attend University days where you are often taught alongside their PGCE. Please be aware that each University has different set ups, lecture timetables and course end dates. If you are unsure about this and the travel commitment involved please ensure that, you ask about this on School Experience or Interview.\r\n\r\nFor more information regarding the School Direct programme, [click here](http://tesla-tsa.com/school-direct/)\r\n","interviewProcess":"How We Select Our Trainees\r\nKey information and main stages of processing\r\n\r\n1.Apply through the UCAS site.

Then all applicants will receive an email and/or letter from the school notifying you that your application is being processed. \r\n\r\n4.

This is usually when a University are not able to attend the initial interview. It is then a decision between both the School and University to offer a training position. \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will spend the majority of the time at your main placement school from September, with training sessions delivered by TESLA on Thursdays and the partner University for your subject.
