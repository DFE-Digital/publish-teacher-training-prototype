If invited for interview, you will be asked to evidence the following:\r\n\r\n- Subject knowledge. We will explore the level of that subject knowledge in relation to your potential to teach the full breadth of the curriculum and the subject specific examination specifications at the relevant Key Stages.\r\n\r\n- Research into the teaching profession. We will explore your understanding of professional training for entry into the teaching profession.\r\n\r\nThe selection process will involve interviews at both the academy and the accredited provider, where the provider is Nottingham Trent University, Bishop Grosseteste University or the University of Nottingham. Where The Cambridge Partnership is the accredited provider there will be one interview at the academy with a representative from the provider in attendance.\r\n\r\nThe academy-based selection process includes a formal interview, a short observed teaching session with a small group of pupils, a handwritten Literacy test, the opportunity to talk to staff and pupils, and a group task with other candidates.\r\n\r\nOur accredited providers will be involved throughout and will have an equal say in the selection. It is a rigorous and thorough process, designed to get the best match of applicant to the places available.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"A contrasting placement at a different school will take place during the Spring term.","personalQualities":"Achieving the best positive outcomes for our pupils is at the heart of all we do.
