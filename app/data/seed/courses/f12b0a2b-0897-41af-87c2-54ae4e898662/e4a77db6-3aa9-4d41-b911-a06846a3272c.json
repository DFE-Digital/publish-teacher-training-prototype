As a trainee you will teach in two contrasting schools across the year.\r\n\r\nTrainees are assessed formatively through the year using an On-Track Review system, through a mixture of observations, portfolios, short tasks and written assignments, all with the consideration of workload and wellbeing.\r\n\r\nTrainees will also have the opportunity to access the Post-Graduate Certificate in Education, worth 60 Masters credits. Although entirely optional, this gives trainees the chance to underpin their reflection and practice with further theoretical understanding.\r\n\r\nA previous trainee said: 'Teach East are amazing! The team are very supportive and provide the skills and knowledge to progress their trainees through the year and prepare them for their teaching careers.'\r\n","interviewProcess":"All applications are reviewed and then shortlisting takes place; successful candidates are invited to attend a two-stage interview process which will include the need to provide a recording of the delivery of selected relevant content linked to the chosen course. \r\n\r\nInterview questions will cover aspects of professional behaviour, subject / phase knowledge, reason for application and safeguarding.\r\n\r\nCandidates will be invited to complete tasks related to Literacy and Numeracy prior to course commencement.\r\n\r\nOffers made are conditional, with conditions outlined clearly to successful candidates. \r\n\r\nWe may request that a candidate completes a Subject Knowledge Enhancement course as part of their offer.

Trainees will have a Main Placement school for the majority of their training year, and the chance to experience a contrasting placement for a sustained period of time after Christmas to enrich their experience. \r\n\r\nThroughout the year we also endeavour to provide trainees with experience of a range of settings through our Core Curriculum days. \r\nWithin the programme trainees will have the chance to experience teaching across their chosen age-range and the relevant Key Stages so they are fully prepared.\r\n\r\nEvery trainee is assigned a dedicated mentor to guide them through the teacher training year and to help them connect the Core Training sessions to classroom practice, offering guidance, setting targets, observing lessons and giving feedback.\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for confident people with a passion for learning and the capacity for reflection and continued improvement. \r\n\r\nAlongside your academic qualifications you need to be highly motivated and well-organized.
