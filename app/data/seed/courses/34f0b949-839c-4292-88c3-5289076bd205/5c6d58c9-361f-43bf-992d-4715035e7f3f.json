Centre-based sessions are, whenever possible led by school based colleagues in one of our teaching classrooms,  either at Keele University (ST5 5BG) or Seabridge Primary School (ST5 3PJ). All our classrooms are set up for young children to be taught within it as well as yourselves. The rooms are fully equipped and you will have access to an extensive set of resources to support all curriculum areas within early years, primary and special needs education. Some of these can be loaned to you whilst on placement. \r\n\r\nWhilst our programme trains you to become a General Primary Practitioner, we also offer specialisms. Our specialisms include, Early Years (PGCE with QTS), English and the Performing Arts, Geography and History, Mathematics (specialism NOT specialist), Physical Education, Science and Art and Design.\r\n\r\nWe have a Special Educational Needs pathway available with Blackfriars Teaching School Alliance in partnership with a number of special school settings across our region. Trainees will benefit from experience across 2 placements, a combination of mainstream and special school settings. We are very excited by this highly innovative, successful and much needed programme. More information can be found on our [website](https://knste-shaw.org.uk/programme-information/#pedagogy-and-send-pathway); if you are interested in this focus then please have a look at our programme offered through the Blackfriars Teaching School Alliance (1JA). \r\n\r\nIf you are interested in applying for our part-time option, you will need to select this at the point of application. This route is known as our Flexible Route and takes place over two years.  If in doubt, just contact us on either 01782 432537 or via [email](mailto:enquiries@knste-shaw.org.uk).\r\n\r\nReflecting on how science influences our lives and the lives of others is a key aspect of primary children's learning in this discipline. The science specialism focuses on developing your understanding of how to develop scientific enquiry with young people. You will carefully consider how best to enable children to develop ideas from evidence by 'working scientifically'. You will reflect on how best to empower your learners to create, consider and evaluate evidence so that they can develop reasoned ideas from their data and findings.\r\n\r\nThrough practice-based sessions that carefully consider both pedagogy and curriculum, we will inspire you to think about the significance of science in the primary phase. We will also enable you to think carefully about progression, assessment and curriculum organisation.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Keele and North Staffordshire Teacher Education co-ordinates recruitment across the partnership. Initially we review your Teacher Training application to ensure that you meet our entry requirements and that your personal statement reflects the capabilities and experiences that we are looking for. If your application meets these stringent criteria then you will be invited to an interview day which will take place online and then in one of our partnership schools.\r\n\r\nYou will be hosted by both a member of the SCITT team and a senior school-based colleague. If you have applied for our SEND Pathway (see Blackfriars) then you will be interviewed within one of our special school settings. \r\n\r\n During the afternoon interview session you will be invited to teach a 15 minute learning sequence to a class that relates to your specialism or pathway.\r\n\r\nWe recognise that this is a demanding process. It is one that involves considerable commitment from you. Our experience suggests that this rigorous process enables us to best match applicants to the places available. Ours is an intense, high quality programme and we need to both assure ourselves, and give you the confidence, that you are best placed to make the most of the opportunities that we have on offer. As a former trainee said 'The course gives you amazing learning opportunities. The staff really help you to gain an understanding of all aspects of teaching, and with  the wider elements of school life.' This is something that we pride ourselves in.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We work closely with several  clusters of  schools. You will be able to benefit from placements in two of these settings; each providing a contrasting experience. Whilst on placement we will support you in offering your pupils an appropriately high quality curriculum, one that both engages and excites them.\r\nIf you are on our Early Years specialism or our SEND pathway then your first placement will be in an EY or SEND environment and your second placement will be in a mainstream primary school. \r\n\r\nPlacement schools are carefully selected for you, and may involve some travel. Across the course we endeavour to minimise travel, though you may have to travel for up to an hour from your home address– note that we do not pay travel expenses.\r\n\r\nDuring the ‘Initial Phase’ you attend the SCITT for two days and your school for three days. The Initial Phase is a gradual introduction into teaching and learning. You will then build up to a teaching commitment of 50% of a class timetable. Individual’s timetable will vary, but in terms of proportions, the following is a guide. Approximately 25% English, 25% maths, 25% science and 25% Foundation subjects (preferably including your specialism, if appropriate).\r\n\r\nYour second placement is undertaken in a different school, following successful completion of your first placement.  During this final placement, you will benefit from being ‘in class’ 75% of the time, 60% will involve you in leading the teaching and 10% - 15% can be team teaching and/ or small group work, including for example the Switch on Reading or SEND interventions.\r\n\r\n In your very final weeks your percentage teaching time will increase to be equivalent to the expectations of an Early Career Teacher so that you are truly job ready!  In these final few weeks there may be the opportunity for you to undertake an enrichment placement that enables you to develop a particular develop aspect of your teaching.\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"Keele and North Staffordshire Teacher Education seeks candidates who are passionate about the transformative power of education and who are reflective and resilient people. We value candidates who are well-organised and who relate well to others. A strong feature of the course is the collaborative community that forms between the trainees and between our schools.  Your peers will form a bedrock of support as you realise your ambition to become an excellent and informed Early Career Teacher. We are able to offer support, in addition to that provided by your Appropriate Body in your first year of teaching. ","otherRequirements":"* A medical report which is deemed satisfactory. \r\n* A completed DBS enhanced disclosure which is deemed satisfactory by the SCITT partnership. \r\n* If you are applying for either our Primary or SEND programmes, prior experience is not required but can be beneficial to you in helping you to decide whether teaching is for you. If you would welcome such an opportunity do get in touch with us or look out for our Back to School days.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:03.398Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-29T15:07:53.171Z","cycle":"2023","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"}
