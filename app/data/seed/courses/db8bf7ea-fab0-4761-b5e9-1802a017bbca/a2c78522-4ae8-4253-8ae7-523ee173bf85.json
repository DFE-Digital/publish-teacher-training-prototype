Some of our SCITT Trainee Teachers often car share, reducing travel costs. Having said this please remember that our partnership of schools are all geographically situated within Leeds.","financialSupport":"At Exceed SCITT we want to ensure that all trainees with potential to become a teacher can access teacher training programmes. \r\n\r\nPlanning to train to be a teacher and choosing the right route into teaching for you is an exciting moment in your life. Getting the right financial advice and support is a crucial step in the decision-making process.\r\n\r\nStaff within the partnership can offer help, support and guidance on funding the tuition fees, applying for a student loan and managing your money throughout the duration of the programme.\r\n","aboutCourse":"This course is targeted at teaching pupils aged between 5 and 11 (KS1 & KS2).\r\n\r\nYou'll be awarded Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) by Exceed SCITT and a Post Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) by a University. \r\n \r\nOur unique programme maximises your time in school and classrooms.  Even the PGCE is drawn directly from your work in school and is not a separate taught course.  Our programme design is innovative, with 3 clear strands: The National Curriculum, so that you develop strong subject knowledge and teaching strategies to ensure pupil’s make good progress. Professional Practice, such as inclusion and effective behaviours for learning so that you are confident to meet the needs of all children in your class. Your personal well-being is also important to us so the programme includes mindfulness, positive psychology and developing resilience. \r\n\r\nEach candidate will be allocated a class-based mentor. You will work with the mentor, receiving weekly tutorials to celebrate successes and work on areas of weakness. Your mentor will work with you to jointly agree your next steps on your journey.\r\n\r\nIf you're wanting to train to be a teacher and make a difference to children’s life chances, there is no better place to train than in our partnership schools. We can offer you opportunities and experiences that very few providers can. Our partnership of schools is an amazing place to train.\r\n\r\nThe Pathways Partnership consists of schools working together to support each other, including training new teachers to potentially employ in our partner nursery, primary and special schools.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Make sure that your application is clear and grammatically accurate. We are looking for your potential as a trainee teacher, not for someone who is already an experienced teacher. In your personal statement you might want to cover the following aspects, which we offer as a guide only.\r\nYour reason for wanting to teach, why primary? Which phase of learning are you most interested in, e.g. EYFS, KS1 or KS2.\r\n\r\nYour vision for education and your commitment to young people in Leeds. What was your 'wow moment' when you knew teaching was the career for you? Any other relevant and transferable skills/experiences that can be related to teaching. \r\n\r\nYou will be invited to interview at one of our partnership schools where you will be made very welcome. You will be given a tour of the school and an opportunity to talk to some of our ECTs or current SCITT Teachers training with us. This way you really can find out about our programme! You will have an opportunity to lead a short teaching episode based upon a children's book and a 30 minute individual interview. This way we really get to know you and you get the opportunity to find out how our partnership supports you to be the best teacher that you can be.  \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You are in school all the time.  In fact, even when you are working on the academic parts of the programme this is supported by a Tutor from the providing University who comes to one of our schools to work with you.  \r\nAll of our partnership schools are 100% committed to your training, so it really doesn't make a difference which schools will be your Home school (where you do the majority of your training) or your Host School (where you have an opportunity to broaden you experience).  \r\n\r\nGeographically our schools are all located in Leeds and our partnership is diverse, from large to smaller schools, and schools that are culturally and socio economically diverse. \r\n\r\nThis course enables you to specialize in the 5-11 age range so your training will take place in Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2 settings.  You will be trained in 2 different schools, however, the structure of the programme will enable you to get to know the whole partnership. This is because your training days are delivered by expert tutors who are also senior leaders within their schools and most of the training on Wednesdays and Thursdays takes place in their school.  Having an opportunity to see practice and meet children in a wide range of schools helps you to reflect on what is going to have the most impact upon your progress towards QTS and employment.\r\n","personalQualities":"Remember that we really try to get to know you as an individual at the interview so that you feel at ease and can evidence the personal qualities that you bring to the programme. It is your personal qualities that will help to make a significant difference to the educational life chances of the pupils in our partnership of schools.","otherRequirements":"Before starting the programme all applicants must be deemed suitable to train to teach so safeguarding checks will be undertaken. They must also demonstrate they are fit to teach so will need to complete a pre-ITT health questionnaire.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:55:40.309Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-28T08:38:38.243Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2023"}
