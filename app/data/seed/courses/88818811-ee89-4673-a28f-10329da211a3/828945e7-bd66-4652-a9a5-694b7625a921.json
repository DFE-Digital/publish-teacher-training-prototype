These are available to trainees whose total household income is less than £42,600. To check eligibility and to apply visit (https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/funding-and-salary/overview)\r\n\r\nHome and EU students may be eligible for a tuition fee loan to cover the costs of the course.\r\nHome students in England may be eligible for a student maintenance loan to help towards living costs and accommodation.\r\n","financialSupport":"Subject Knowledge Enhancement Courses may be available in this subject.  \r\n\r\nThese courses usually bring with them generous tax free Bursaries and are available to applicants holding a conditional offer of a teacher training place.\r\n\r\nInformation on availability of these courses should be available at the end of December 2020.\r\n\r\n","aboutCourse":"GCSE study in the sciences provides the foundation for understanding the material world. Scientific understanding is changing our lives and is vital to the world’s future prosperity, and all learners should be taught essential aspects of the knowledge, methods, processes and uses of science. They should be helped to appreciate how the complex and diverse phenomena of the natural world can be described in terms of a small number of key ideas relating to the sciences which are both inter-linked, and are of universal application.\r\n\r\nThese key ideas include:\r\n\r\n• the use of conceptual models and theories to make sense of the observed diversity of natural phenomena\r\n\r\n• the assumption that every effect has one or more cause\r\n\r\n• that change is driven by differences between different objects and systems when they interact\r\n\r\n• that many such interactions occur over a distance and over time without direct contact\r\n\r\n• that science progresses through a cycle of hypothesis, practical experimentation, observation, theory development and review\r\n\r\n• that quantitative analysis is a central element both of many theories and of scientific methods of inquiry.\r\n\r\nMany schools are now offering Triple Science, and it is a good idea to gain a basic knowledge across all the sciences.  We offer a Subject Knowledge Enhancement Course in all three Sciences, which you can access once  you have a conditional offer of a teacher training place in any route.  Our SKEs are bespoke, tailored to your availability and requirements and can bring you a generous tax free Bursary whilst you train.","interviewProcess":"Potential to Teach\r\nYou should demonstrate high expectations for your pupils, be passionate about your subject and engage your pupils.\r\n\r\nPotential to Reflect\r\nYou should be able to reflect on all aspects of your planning and teaching so that you can constantly update and amend lessons accordingly to further improve your performance and delivery.\r\n\r\nInterview Process\r\nWhilst every effort will be made to accommodate your choice of campus, staffing capacity changes and for this reason your application may also be circulated to other schools within the partnership. It may be that several schools will express interest in you. This method ensures you have an increased opportunity of a successful outcome.\r\n\r\nYou will usually be invited to interview where you will be asked to teach a 20 minute learning activity to a class of pupils.\r\nFollowing the learning activity, you will have an interview with the Professional Mentor and Head of Department. Some schools may ask you to take part in a Student Panel, or to undertake an activity involving students.\r\n\r\nIf all goes well, you will be told the decision and the UCAS website will be updated accordingly.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The major benefit of School Direct is being able to select the school in which you are going to do the majority of your training. This choice is often influenced by location and distance travelling from home.\r\n\r\nUsually you will spend most of your time at your base school, with one day a week spent at your university (weekly with Warwick and fortnightly with Derby).\r\n\r\nWe also have a number of Alliance Days where we deliver part of your training to all trainee teachers from across the partnership.\r\n\r\nYour complementary placement takes place after Christmas, usually during the first half of the Spring Term. This is usually set up within the partnership schools and in many cases will be a straight swap between trainees doing the same subject. All the schools within the partnership are within a 30 minute drive of The Polesworth School, which is the Lead School in the Partnership.\r\n\r\nTrainees are also required to undertake a minimum of 5 days in a primary setting.\r\n\r\nAs well as your university mentor, you will have access to a professional mentor and subject mentor at your base school. You will have support every step of the way and will not be expected to fly solo until you feel you're ready to do so. The expectation is that by the time you finish your course you should be teaching around 70% of a teacher's full timetable.\r\n\r\nYou will also be required to undertake a number of written tasks set by the university that will contribute towards a Masters Degree should you wish to complete one. Also, you will be collecting evidence throughout the year to complete your personal learning portfolio which you will use to demonstrate your learning journey.\r\n","personalQualities":"We are actively seeking good quality honours graduates with excellent communication skills; who have the ability to enthuse young people about their chosen subject; are able to demonstrate resilience and who are self-starters with the ability to use their initiative.  ","otherRequirements":"Whilst not a necessity, recent, relevant school experience, or experience of working with young people, is strongly encouraged.  We offer Taster Days and School Experience across most subjects.\r\n\r\nThe successful candidate will need to satisfy the necessary safeguarding and prohibition checks and satisfy the HEI provider that they are proficient in maths and English skills prior to QTS being awarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:47:01.307Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-09T13:39:57.174Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2023"}
