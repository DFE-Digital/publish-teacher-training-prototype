This helps student teachers develop a critical awareness and strong classroom skills to enable them to become a competent, principled professional and educational thinker. Students who successfully complete this programme will be recommended for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).\r\n\r\nThis programme enables student teachers to engage critically with a number of approaches and issues relating to languages education, such as the teaching of grammar, the incorporation of literature into lessons, target language use and the monitoring and assessment of pupils' learning. It incorporates a range of approaches to effective, inclusive learning, and develops a student’s professionalism and critical awareness to a high level. The programme prepares languages student teachers to teach the 11-19 age range. \r\n\r\nThe Languages PGCE programme is informed by research and places a strong emphasis on cultural knowledge, use of literature in the languages classroom, pupils' use of target language and broader aspects of language learning including issues related to SEND, bilingual learners and English as an additional language (EAL). We also promote creative and innovative practice and include sessions that focus on the effective use of information and communications technology and digital, video and multimedia.\r\n\r\nThis programme consists of three core modules: two Master’s-level (level 7) modules, which are assessed through written assignments, and the Professional Practice module, which is assessed by the observation of practical teaching in placement schools.\r\n\r\nThe programme is delivered via a programme of subject lectures, seminars, workshops, tutorials, 'Debates in Education' and directed study days at the IOE and in schools, as well as time spent in placements. Assessment is by practical teaching, assignments and portfolio tasks. \r\n\r\nStudents will spend most of their time (120 days) in schools, working with subject specialist mentors who support you through your two school placements. We are fortunate to have a good choice of schools with whom we work, with many outstanding mentors and strong Languages departments.","interviewProcess":"Candidates whose applications meet the entry criteria will be invited to interview either online or at our central London location, depending on the subject applied to. At your interview day, you will take part in a combination of group and individual interviews with members of the programme team, and may also be asked to undertake written or presentation tasks, depending on your subject or phase. You will have the opportunity to ask any pertinent questions.\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The IOE works with over 300 placement schools, chosen for their quality, excellence in supporting teacher education and to provide comprehensive geographical coverage across a wide range of phases, subjects and specialisms. You will undertake two placements of approximately equal length (circa 60 days) in different schools, each with a dedicated subject mentor to support your development, with both schools carefully matched to your needs in terms of location, stage and subject, taking any mobility needs into account. London has more 'good' and 'outstanding' schools than any other region in England and is a world leader in narrowing the gap between the performance of children from a range of different backgrounds. Training in London will provide you with an ideal platform to launch your career in teaching. \r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"Great teachers are as diverse as the communities they serve. We look for candidates who have a real enthusiasm for engaging with young people, who are as excited about the process of learning as they are about teaching, and who understand that they will learn as much from their students as their students will from them. Sound subject knowledge is important, as well as students’ ability to break down their knowledge and see it through the eyes of someone for whom it is new. We particularly welcome a commitment to improving the lives of individuals and communities through education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"For information about all of UCL's statutory requirements linked to Teacher Training programmes please visit our [website] (https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/teacher-training/entry-requirements/).","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:40.317Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-29T20:46:22.914Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
