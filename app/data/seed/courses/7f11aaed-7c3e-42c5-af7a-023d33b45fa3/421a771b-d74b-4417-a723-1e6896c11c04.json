Religious Education gives learners this opportunity through its curriculum and pedagogical approaches. The Religious Education PGCE programme supports student teachers in developing the knowledge and skills they need to help pupils explore their ultimate and immediate questions about their own lives and the lives of others through reflective, critical and academic engagement with contributions from religious, non-religious, philosophical and ethical thought. Students who successfully complete this programme will be recommended for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).\r\n\r\nThrough engagement with scholarship and placements in two contrasting schools, the PGCE enables students to reflect on the aims and purposes of Religious Education and learn from experts about how different pedagogies can support young people to develop key knowledge and skills to engage critically in a religiously and non-religiously plural world. The programme prepares Religious Education student teachers to teach the 11-19 age range.\r\n\r\nThis programme offers students opportunities such as visits to places of worship, national galleries and museums, as well as the chance to discuss religion with leading philosophers and people of faith and consider the impact of religion on society today. Research at the IOE and elsewhere is drawn upon to inform a student's Religious Education teaching and encourage them to engage with recent debates and literature in the field. Tutors on the programme are skilled classroom practitioners with extensive experience in secondary schools and colleges as well as in school leadership, inspection, educational research and consultancy. \r\n\r\nThe Secondary PGCE consists of three core modules: two Master’s-level (level 7) modules, which are assessed through written assignments, and the Professional Practice module, which is assessed by the observation of practical teaching in placement schools.\r\n\r\nThe programme is delivered via a programme of  subject lectures, seminars, workshops, tutorials. 'Debates in Education' and directed study days at the IOE, as well as time spent in placements. Assessment is by practical teaching, assignments and portfolio tasks.\r\n\r\nYou will spend most of your time (120 days) in schools, working with religious education mentors who support you through your two school placements. We are fortunate to have a good choice of schools with whom we work, with many outstanding mentors and strong religious education departments. The Professional Practice module is assessed through these placements, associated tasks and a portfolio.","interviewProcess":"Candidates whose applications meet the entry criteria will be invited to interview either online or at our central London location, depending on the subject applied to. At your interview day, you will take part in a combination of group and individual interviews with members of the programme team, and may also be asked to undertake written or presentation tasks, depending on your subject or phase. You will have the opportunity to ask any pertinent questions.\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The IOE works with over 300 placement schools, chosen for their quality, excellence in supporting teacher education and to provide comprehensive geographical coverage across a wide range of phases, subjects and specialisms. You will undertake two placements of approximately equal length (circa 60 days) in different schools, each with a dedicated subject mentor to support your development, with both schools carefully matched to your needs in terms of location, stage and subject, taking any mobility needs into account. London has more 'good' and 'outstanding' schools than any other region in England and is a world leader in narrowing the gap between the performance of children from a range of different backgrounds. Training in London will provide you with an ideal platform to launch your career in teaching. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"Great teachers are as diverse as the communities they serve. We look for candidates who have a real enthusiasm for engaging with young people, who are as excited about the process of learning as they are about teaching, and who understand that they will learn as much from their students as their students will from them. Sound subject knowledge is important, as well as students’ ability to break down their knowledge and see it through the eyes of someone for whom it is new. We particularly welcome a commitment to improving the lives of individuals and communities through education.\r\n\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"For information about all of UCL's statutory requirements linked to Teacher Training programmes please visit our [website] (https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/teacher-training/entry-requirements/).","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:40.645Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-29T20:54:23.742Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
