Along with practical knowledge, it offers perspectives on the role of language in learning, the teaching of literacies and literature, the principles of curriculum design, and evaluation, and assessment and recording. summative assessment.\r\n\r\nYou will develop an understanding of classroom practice and the theories underpinning teaching and learning in English, media and drama. You will work with others to produce assessed Theatre in Education (TiE) presentations for children in partnership schools. This develops students’ understanding of how drama and theatre can be applied to teaching and learning.\r\n\r\nStudents will be joining the largest English PGCE programme in the country, allowing them to benefit from a team of tutors with unparalleled expertise in the subject. Students will also be able to develop supportive peer networks, sharing ideas and resources.\r\n\r\nSessions at the IOE are interactive and practical, and students will participate in a range of group and individual activities, some of which involve collaboration with schools and other organisations, for example Shakespeare’s Globe and the British Film Institute. The PGCE year ends with a collaborative TiE project that involves a tour to partnership schools.\r\n\r\nThe Secondary PGCE consists of three core modules: two Master’s-level (level 7) modules, which are assessed through written and performance-based assignments, and the Professional Practice module, which is assessed by the observation of practical teaching in placement schools. \r\n\r\nThe programme is delivered via a programme of subject lectures, seminars, workshops, tutorials. 'Debates in Education' and directed study days at the IOE, as well as time spent in placements. Assessment is by practical teaching, assignments and portfolio tasks. Students will spend most of their time (120 days) in schools, working with English and drama mentors who support you through your two school placements. The Professional Practice module is assessed through these placements, associated tasks and a portfolio.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Candidates whose applications meet the entry criteria will be invited to interview either online or at our central London location, depending on the subject applied to. At your interview day, you will take part in a combination of group and individual interviews with members of the programme team, and may also be asked to undertake written or presentation tasks, depending on your subject or phase. You will have the opportunity to ask any pertinent questions.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The IOE works with over 300 placement schools, chosen for their quality, excellence in supporting teacher education and to provide comprehensive geographical coverage across a wide range of phases, subjects and specialisms. You will undertake two placements of approximately equal length (circa 60 days) in different schools, each with a dedicated subject mentor to support your development, with both schools carefully matched to your needs in terms of location, stage and subject, taking any mobility needs into account. London has more 'good' and 'outstanding' schools than any other region in England and is a world leader in narrowing the gap between the performance of children from a range of different backgrounds. Training in London will provide you with an ideal platform to launch your career in teaching. \r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"Great teachers are as diverse as the communities they serve. We look for candidates who have a real enthusiasm for engaging with young people, who are as excited about the process of learning as they are about teaching, and who understand that they will learn as much from their students as their students will from them. Sound subject knowledge is important, as well as students’ ability to break down their knowledge and see it through the eyes of someone for whom it is new. We particularly welcome a commitment to improving the lives of individuals and communities through education.\r\n\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"For information about all UCL's statutory requirements linked to Teacher Training programmes please visit our [website] (https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/teacher-training/entry-requirements/)","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:39.940Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-29T20:41:48.434Z","cycle":"2023","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
