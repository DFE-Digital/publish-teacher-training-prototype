We are committed to creative and interactive approaches to teaching science to promote engagement and learning.\r\nStudents will acquire a critical understanding of current debates and issues relating to science education, and will be guided and supported in developing their subject knowledge. We expect students to engage with reading and research into science education and to regularly reflect upon their own progress, towards meeting the teaching standards across the 11–19 age range.\r\n\r\nThis programme will cover health and safety, management of teaching and learning in laboratories and outdoors, the use of ICT, facilitating small group discussion, meeting pupils' special needs, and assessment. Our facilities include a suite of laboratories and a micro-computing laboratory.\r\nThe Chemistry PGCE offers unique opportunities including teaching sessions at off-site locations such as museums and Kew Gardens, developing students’ understanding of learning science outside the classroom.\r\n\r\nThe Secondary PGCE consists of three core modules: two Master’s-level (level 7) modules, which are assessed through written assignments, and the Professional Practice Module, which is assessed by the observation of practical teaching in placement schools.\r\n\r\nThe Secondary PGCE full-time route is delivered via a programme of subject lectures, seminars, workshops, tutorials, 'Debates in Education' and directed study days at the Institute of Education, as well as time spent in placement schools or colleges. Assessment is by practical teaching, assignments and portfolio tasks.\r\n\r\nStudent teachers undertake at least two placements (totalling 120 days) at a school or college, during which time their teaching practice will be supported by a school subject tutor and mentor. The Professional Practice module is assessed through these placements, associated tasks and a portfolio. \r\n\r\nStudents may teach: \r\n\r\nKey Stage 3: science (including elements of physics, chemistry, biology) \r\nKey Stage 4: science (all areas) or chemistry (depending on school placement) \r\nKey Stage 5: AS/A2 level chemistry","interviewProcess":"Candidates whose applications meet the entry criteria will be invited to interview either online or at our central London location, depending on the subject applied to. At your interview day, you will take part in a combination of group and individual interviews with members of the programme team, and may also be asked to undertake written or presentation tasks, depending on your subject or phase. You will have the opportunity to ask any pertinent questions.\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The IOE works with over 300 placement schools, chosen for their quality, excellence in supporting teacher education and to provide comprehensive geographical coverage across a wide range of phases, subjects and specialisms. You will undertake two placements of approximately equal length (circa 60 days) in different schools, each with a dedicated subject mentor to support your development, with both schools carefully matched to your needs in terms of location, stage and subject, taking any mobility needs into account. London has more 'good' and 'outstanding' schools than any other region in England and is a world leader in narrowing the gap between the performance of children from a range of different backgrounds. Training in London will provide you with an ideal platform to launch your career in teaching. \r\n","personalQualities":"Great teachers are as diverse as the communities they serve. We look for candidates who have a real enthusiasm for engaging with young people, who are as excited about the process of learning as they are about teaching, and who understand that they will learn as much from their students as their students will from them. Sound subject knowledge is important, as well as students’ ability to break down their knowledge and see it through the eyes of someone for whom it is new. We particularly welcome a commitment to improving the lives of individuals and communities through education.\r\n\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"For information about all UCL's statutory requirements linked to Teacher Training programmes please visit our [website] (https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/teacher-training/entry-requirements/)","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:39.796Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-29T20:38:44.551Z","cycle":"2023","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
