As a geography teacher, you will take responsibility for introducing children to the ideas and methods of geography, helping them to investigate people, places and processes. You will support children to better understand the complexities and wonders of the Earth, enabling them in both their education and their everyday lives.\r\n       \r\nOn completion of the course, you will gain a PGCE and QTS (Qualified Teacher Status), equipping you to teach geography in secondary schools. During the PGCE, you will be supported to tackle the at once practical and conceptual questions of who are the children I teach? Why teach geography? and what geography should I teach and how should I teach it?\r\n\r\nTutors on the Geography PGCE are skilled classroom practitioners with extensive experience in secondary schools and colleges, in school leadership, inspection, educational research and consultancy. The IOE’s partnership with over 200 secondary schools and colleges in Greater London and beyond enables each of our students to become a skilled and confident teacher in their chosen subject specialism.                                                                                                                                                                                                        \r\n\r\nThe Secondary PGCE consists of three core modules: two Master’s-level (level 7) modules, which are assessed through written assignments, and the Professional Practice module, which is assessed by the observation of practical teaching in placement schools. The programme is delivered via a programme of subject lectures, seminars, workshops, tutorials. 'Debates in Education' and directed study days at the IOE, as well as time spent in placements. Assessment is by practical teaching, assignments and portfolio tasks.\r\n\r\nStudents will spend most of their time (120 days) in two placement schools, working with geography mentors who provide support during the placements. We are fortunate to have a good choice of schools with whom we work, with many outstanding mentors and strong geography departments.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Candidates whose applications meet the entry criteria will be invited to interview either online or at our central London location, depending on the subject applied to. At your interview day, you will take part in a combination of group and individual interviews with members of the programme team, and may also be asked to undertake written or presentation tasks, depending on your subject or phase. You will have the opportunity to ask any pertinent questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The IOE works with over 300 placement schools, chosen for their quality, excellence in supporting teacher education and to provide comprehensive geographical coverage across a wide range of phases, subjects and specialisms. You will undertake two placements of approximately equal length (circa 60 days) in different schools, each with a dedicated subject mentor to support your development, with both schools carefully matched to your needs in terms of location, stage and subject, taking any mobility needs into account. London has more 'good' and 'outstanding' schools than any other region in England and is a world leader in narrowing the gap between the performance of children from a range of different backgrounds. Training in London will provide you with an ideal platform to launch your career in teaching. \r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"Great teachers are as diverse as the communities they serve. We look for candidates who have a real enthusiasm for engaging with young people, who are as excited about the process of learning as they are about teaching, and who understand that they will learn as much from their students as their students will from them. Sound subject knowledge is important, as well as students’ ability to break down their knowledge and see it through the eyes of someone for whom it is new. We particularly welcome a commitment to improving the lives of individuals and communities through education.\r\n\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"For information about all UCL's statutory requirements linked to Teacher Training programmes please visit our [website] (https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/teacher-training/entry-requirements/)","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:39.973Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-29T20:44:43.646Z","cycle":"2023","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
