This programme prepares students to teach psychology in a flexible and exciting way. Tutors on the Psychology PGCE are skilled classroom practitioners with extensive experience in secondary schools and colleges, in school leadership, inspection, educational research and consultancy. They are committed to promoting interactive teaching and learning in their sessions; a collaborative ethos is encouraged so that students share materials, resources and ideas.  The programme specialises in psychology teaching, with some opportunities to teach in other related curriculum subjects.\r\n\r\nWe draw on current research at the UCL Institute of Education (IOE) and elsewhere to inform a students' psychology and social science teaching, encouraging them to engage with recent debates, literature and policy in the field. Our underlying aim is to develop reflective, inquiring, compassionate Psychology teachers who are committed to social justice, inclusion and diversity. \r\n\r\nAt the IOE, students will participate in a range of lectures and seminars designed to enhance their development as a teacher. These interactive sessions will cover how children learn, assessment, lesson planning, promoting positive behaviour and subject-specific matters.\r\nDuring their teaching practice placements, students benefit from our partnership with over 200 secondary schools and colleges in Greater London and beyond, which enables each of our students to become a skilled and confident teacher in their chosen subject specialism.\r\nThe Secondary PGCE consists of three core modules: two Master’s-level (level 7) modules, which are assessed through written assignments, and the Professional Practice module, which is assessed by the observation of practical teaching in placement schools. The programme is delivered via a programme of  subject sessions, seminars, workshops, tutorials. 'Debates in Education' and directed study days at the IOE, as well as time spent in placement schools or colleges. \r\n\r\nStudents on this programme will spend most of their time (120 days) in schools, working with psychology and social science  mentors who support them through their two school placements. In our partner schools and colleges, students teach Psychology at A level. At GCSE, most student teachers teach Psychology and/or Sociology. In some placements there are opportunities to contribute to relevant vocational qualifications and Key Stage 3 humanities. Your responsibilities will be equivalent to a practicing teacher but on a reduced timetable.","interviewProcess":"Candidates whose applications meet the entry criteria will be invited to interview either online or at our central London location, depending on the subject applied to. At your interview day, you will take part in a combination of group and individual interviews with members of the programme team, and may also be asked to undertake written or presentation tasks, depending on your subject or phase. You will have the opportunity to ask any pertinent questions.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The IOE works with over 300 placement schools, chosen for their quality, excellence in supporting teacher education and to provide comprehensive geographical coverage across a wide range of phases, subjects and specialisms. You will undertake two placements of approximately equal length (circa 60 days) in different schools, each with a dedicated subject mentor to support your development, with both schools carefully matched to your needs in terms of location, stage and subject, taking any mobility needs into account. London has more 'good' and 'outstanding' schools than any other region in England and is a world leader in narrowing the gap between the performance of children from a range of different backgrounds. Training in London will provide you with an ideal platform to launch your career in teaching. \r\n","personalQualities":"Great teachers are as diverse as the communities they serve. We look for candidates who have a real enthusiasm for engaging with young people, who are as excited about the process of learning as they are about teaching, and who understand that they will learn as much from their students as their students will from them. Sound subject knowledge is important, as well as students’ ability to break down their knowledge and see it through the eyes of someone for whom it is new. We particularly welcome a commitment to improving the lives of individuals and communities through education.\r\n\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"For information about all of UCL's statutory requirements linked to Teacher Training programmes please visit our [website] (https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/teacher-training/entry-requirements/).","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:40.603Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-29T20:52:06.129Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
