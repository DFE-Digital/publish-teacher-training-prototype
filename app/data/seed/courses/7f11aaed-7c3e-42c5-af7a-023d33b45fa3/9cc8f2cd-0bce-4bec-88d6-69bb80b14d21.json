Our aim is to equip students to do just that, developing their ability to plan meaningful historical experiences for pupils in the 11–19 age range, to teach effectively and to assess their own and their pupils’ achievements. This programme is suited to those wishing to gain Qualified Teaching Status (QTS) for teaching in a UK maintained (state-funded) school and who have fulfilled the appropriate entry requirements.\r\n\r\nThere are five key themes underpinning the UCL PGCE History programme: 'historical thinking', 'diverse histories', 'history for all', 'engaging with history' and ‘ becoming a professional history teacher'. These themes reflect our location in the capital, the wide range of schools and students that we work with and our ambition to engage, challenge and enlighten all learners. Students will understand why history is taught in schools, how pupils learn and make sense of the past, and how to teach history in an exciting way that develops learners.\r\n\r\nThe UCL Institute of Education History PGCE course explores a number of aspects of diverse multicultural histories, and our tutors and alumni are regularly involved in presenting such hidden histories in local and national forums.  We also offer students unique London-based opportunities at museums or other historical sites. \r\n\r\nUCL also hosts the Centre for Holocaust Education and the First World War Centenary Battlefield Tours Programme and we provide the opportunity to complete a full two-day teachers' programme in Holocaust Education as part of the PGCE. \r\n\r\nThe Secondary PGCE consists of three core modules: two Master’s-level (level 7) modules, which are assessed through written assignments, and the Professional Practice module, which is assessed by the observation of practical teaching in placement schools.\r\n\r\nTeaching at UCL Institute of Education is mostly through seminars and workshops in your teaching base group, along with a programme of  subject lectures, tutorials, 'Debates in Education' and directed study days, as well as time spent in placements. Assessment is by practical teaching, assignments and portfolio tasks.\r\n\r\nStudents spend most of their time (120) days in schools, working with history mentors who support them through two school placements. We are fortunate to work with an excellent range of placement schools within the London Orbital Motorway (M25). The Professional Practice module is assessed through these placements, associated tasks and a portfolio.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Candidates whose applications meet the entry criteria will be invited to interview either online or at our central London location, depending on the subject applied to. At your interview day, you will take part in a combination of group and individual interviews with members of the programme team, and may also be asked to undertake written or presentation tasks, depending on your subject or phase. You will have the opportunity to ask any pertinent questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The IOE works with over 300 placement schools, chosen for their quality, excellence in supporting teacher education and to provide comprehensive geographical coverage across a wide range of phases, subjects and specialisms. You will undertake two placements of approximately equal length (circa 60 days) in different schools, each with a dedicated subject mentor to support your development, with both schools carefully matched to your needs in terms of location, stage and subject, taking any mobility needs into account. London has more 'good' and 'outstanding' schools than any other region in England and is a world leader in narrowing the gap between the performance of children from a range of different backgrounds. Training in London will provide you with an ideal platform to launch your career in teaching. \r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"Great teachers are as diverse as the communities they serve. We look for candidates who have a real enthusiasm for engaging with young people, who are as excited about the process of learning as they are about teaching, and who understand that they will learn as much from their students as their students will from them. Sound subject knowledge is important, as well as students’ ability to break down their knowledge and see it through the eyes of someone for whom it is new. We particularly welcome a commitment to improving the lives of individuals and communities through education.\r\n\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"For information about all UCL's statutory requirements linked to Teacher Training programmes please visit our [website] (https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/teacher-training/entry-requirements/)","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:40.033Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-29T20:45:38.856Z","cycle":"2023","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
