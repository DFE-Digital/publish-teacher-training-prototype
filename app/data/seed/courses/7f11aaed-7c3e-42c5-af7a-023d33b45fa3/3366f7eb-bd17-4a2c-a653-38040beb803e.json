During the programme, students will develop the skills required to be a specialist subject teacher capable of designing and delivering excellent lessons in computing.\r\n\r\nThe programme consists of university-based sessions, school-based sessions and teaching placements. University-based sessions will include the study of the Computing curriculum, lesson planning, effective teaching, classroom management and approaches to assessment. Some of the professional studies elements will be delivered in school. Students will gain experience of a wide range of approaches to teaching, while working with very experienced mentors who are skilled at providing positive feedback and support.\r\n\r\nTutors on the Secondary PGCE are skilled classroom practitioners with extensive experience in secondary schools and colleges, in school leadership, inspection, educational research and consultancy. Throughout their time on the PGCE Computing with ICT, students will be supported by tutors and specialist subject mentors with many years of experience as classroom teachers, heads of department and subject advisory teachers.\r\n\r\nThe Secondary PGCE consists of three core modules: two Master’s-level (level 7) modules, which are assessed through written assignments, and the Professional Practice module, which is assessed by the observation of practical teaching in placement schools.  This Programme is delivered via keynote lectures, subject lectures, seminars, workshops, tutorials and directed study days at the IOE, as well as time spent in placements. Assessment is by practical teaching, assignments and portfolio tasks.\r\nYou will spend most of your time (120 days) in schools, working with subject specialist mentors who will support you through your two school placements. We are fortunate to have a good choice of schools with whom we work, with some outstanding mentors and strong computing departments. The Professional Practice module is assessed through these placements, associated tasks and a portfolio.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Candidates whose applications meet the entry criteria will be invited to interview either online or at our central London location, depending on the subject applied to. At your interview day, you will take part in a combination of group and individual interviews with members of the programme team, and may also be asked to undertake written or presentation tasks, depending on your subject or phase. You will have the opportunity to ask any pertinent questions.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The IOE works with over 300 placement schools, chosen for their quality, excellence in supporting teacher education and to provide comprehensive geographical coverage across a wide range of phases, subjects and specialisms. You will undertake two placements of approximately equal length (circa 60 days) in different schools, each with a dedicated subject mentor to support your development, with both schools carefully matched to your needs in terms of location, stage and subject, taking any mobility needs into account. London has more 'good' and 'outstanding' schools than any other region in England and is a world leader in narrowing the gap between the performance of children from a range of different backgrounds. Training in London will provide you with an ideal platform to launch your career in teaching.  \r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"Great teachers are as diverse as the communities they serve. We look for candidates who have a real enthusiasm for engaging with young people, who are as excited about the process of learning as they are about teaching, and who understand that they will learn as much from their students as their students will from them. Sound subject knowledge is important, as well as students’ ability to break down their knowledge and see it through the eyes of someone for whom it is new. We particularly welcome a commitment to improving the lives of individuals and communities through education.\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"For information about all UCL's statutory requirements linked to Teacher Training programmes please visit our [website] (https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/teacher-training/entry-requirements/)","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:39.863Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-29T20:40:28.761Z","cycle":"2023","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
