The Mathematics PGCE programme at the Institute of Education is rigorously informed by research, including developments internationally. Students learn how to make mathematics meaningful, interesting and fun and how to analyse their own and their pupils’ development.\r\n\r\nThe PGCE mathematics programme aims to develop critical understanding of the nature of mathematics and its position in the school curriculum. Student teachers engage with research evidence and theories of learning in order to make sense of practice they observe in schools. They explore how teaching approaches can help learners develop mathematical reasoning and problem-solving skills and cultivate enjoyment of mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe PGCE Mathematics tutors are skilled classroom practitioners with extensive experience of teaching and leadership in secondary schools. They are also currently engaged in research in mathematics education. The programme draws regularly on the wider range of expertise in mathematics education available within UCL Institute of Education.\r\nThe secondary PGCE consists of three core modules: two Master's level (level 7) modules, which are assessed through written assignments and the Professional Practice module, which is assessed by the observation of practical teaching in two placement schools.\r\n\r\nThe Mathematics PGCE is taught via a programme of subject studies seminars, workshops, tutorials, 'Debates in Education' and directed study days at the UCL Institute of Education and through two placements at partnership schools. Assessment is by the observation of practical teaching, written academic assignments and a portfolio of key assessments (which is closely linked to the Teachers' Standards).\r\n\r\nStudent Teachers undertake placements at two partnership schools (120 days in total). During each placement the development of their teaching practice is supported closely by a school-based mentor and other colleagues within the mathematics department. The school also provides a programme of Professional Studies which is co-ordinated by a senior teacher at the school. The Professional Practice module is assessed through observations of teaching and a portfolio of key assessments collated by the student teacher.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Candidates whose applications meet the entry criteria will be invited to interview either online or at our central London location, depending on the subject applied to. At your interview day, you will take part in a combination of group and individual interviews with members of the programme team, and may also be asked to undertake written or presentation tasks, depending on your subject or phase. You will have the opportunity to ask any pertinent questions.\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The IOE works with over 300 placement schools, chosen for their quality, excellence in supporting teacher education and to provide comprehensive geographical coverage across a wide range of phases, subjects and specialisms. You will undertake two placements of approximately equal length (circa 60 days) in different schools, each with a dedicated subject mentor to support your development, with both schools carefully matched to your needs in terms of location, stage and subject, taking any mobility needs into account. London has more 'good' and 'outstanding' schools than any other region in England and is a world leader in narrowing the gap between the performance of children from a range of different backgrounds. Training in London will provide you with an ideal platform to launch your career in teaching. \r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"Great teachers are as diverse as the communities they serve. We look for candidates who have a real enthusiasm for engaging with young people, who are as excited about the process of learning as they are about teaching, and who understand that they will learn as much from their students as their students will from them. Sound subject knowledge is important, as well as students’ ability to break down their knowledge and see it through the eyes of someone for whom it is new. We particularly welcome a commitment to improving the lives of individuals and communities through education.\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"For information about all UCL's statutory requirements linked to Teacher Training programmes please visit our website: [https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/teacher-training/entry-requirements]","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:40.199Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-29T20:47:00.949Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
