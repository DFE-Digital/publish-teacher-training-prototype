The subject mentor also monitors and observes trainees, helping to ensure they develop the qualities necessary to meet the national Teacher Standards.   Each school also has its own Teach Maidenhead Professional Coordinating Mentor who oversees the subject mentors, while weekly Professional Studies sessions are led by experts from across the five schools.  \r\n\r\nTrainees receive on-the-job training in a highly supportive and aspirational environment by expert teachers in the partnership schools.  In addition they attend training at the University of Reading where there is  a strong network of drama mentors, many of whom have taken the course themselves and are managing thriving departments. Links exist with National Drama, the theatre educators, and local and regional professional theatre practitioners with facilities including  dedicated technical studios both within the Institute of Education and the Department of Film, Theatre and Television within the University.\r\n\r\nThe University works closely with Teach Maidenhead, planning and delivering training programmes in collaboratively.\r\n\r\nThe programme comprises two main aspects: Professional Studies and Subject Studies: \r\n\r\nProfessional Studies develops insights into general aspects of education essential for entrants to the teaching profession. It gives consideration to whole-school issues, such as behaviour management, special educational needs and educational theories that contextualise the teaching of your subject. \r\n\r\nSubject Studies enables trainees to study the teaching of their chosen subject. This includes consideration of aspects such as: the nature of the subject in the secondary school; its place in The National Curriculum; what is taught; how it is taught; how it is assessed; providing for young people with different backgrounds and abilities; teaching in accordance with examination specification requirements; and using ICT effectively to facilitate learning.\r\n\r\nTrainees will be assessed against the eight Teachers’ Standards, based on the evidence of their teaching, wider contribution to school life and ability to reflect on and evaluate these experiences. Assessment will be carried out in school and moderated by University tutors.\r\n\r\nTrainees are required to write three assignments during the year. These are designed to deepen their reflection on their school experience in the light of educational research, and to develop their ability to research their own practice. As well as being assessed in their own right, the assignments will contribute evidence towards the assessment against the Teachers’ Standards. \r\n","interviewProcess":"The recruitment process is rigorous and thorough, designed to get the best match of applicant to the places available.\r\nShortlisted applicants will be invited for one interview at the Teach Maidenhead school usually where they will carry out their main placement.
