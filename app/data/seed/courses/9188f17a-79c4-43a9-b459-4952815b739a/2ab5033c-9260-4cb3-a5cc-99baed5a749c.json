If any shortfall is identified, you may be required to complete some additional work before starting the programme. During the programme, your subject knowledge and fundamental English and mathematics will be developed and assessed to ensure you reach the required level.The interview process is likely to include a presentation, group discussion, reading and writing tasks to probe subject knowledge, and an individual face-to-face interview.
