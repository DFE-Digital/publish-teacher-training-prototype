This additional pathway is eligible for bursary assessment since training teachers will be able to select English as the main subject for QTS assessment whilst also developing specialism in Drama teaching.\r\n\r\nAt Middlesex, we understand that many of our students may experience financial difficulties. We offer our students a wide variety of additional financial support options to help them fund or part-fund their education.\r\nFor further information, see; \r\n[www.mdx.ac.uk](https://unihub.mdx.ac.uk/support/fees-payments-funding/financial-support)\r\n","aboutCourse":"For further information, see\r\n[mdx.ac.uk](https://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/secondary-drama)\r\nIn collaboration with the PGCE English programme we offer two pathways for training teachers who wish to teach both Drama and English. \r\nEnglish and Drama (QTS) and Drama with English (QTS) \r\nAt Middlesex University, we are passionate about both English and Drama. In English, you will explore language, literature, expression and the role of communication. In drama you will learn how to engage pupils through the practical nature of the lessons.\r\nDrama with English: \r\nTrainees on this pathway will be assessed meeting the Teachers’ Standards with Drama as the main subject. You will also be able to experience teaching English to KS3.  \r\nTeachers adept in both subjects are able to educate and inspire pupils, develop their creativity and shape vital skills that impact students' performance across a range of other subjects.\r\nWe have excellent relationships with schools across Greater London and during your studies, you will undertake teaching placements in at least two secondary schools and have the chance to acquire skills in the application of new technologies in teaching and learning. Schools are carefully selected to suit each individual and expose them to a variety of imaginative and thought provoking learning strategies. Key experts from our partner schools are on hand to offer invaluable mentoring and support.\r\nThrough interactive workshops, tutorials, lectures and debates, this one-year full-time course enables you to meet and exceed the Teachers’ Standards for the award of Qualified Teacher Status.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Entry onto this course requires an interview. We use the interview to find out more about you, to better understand your aspirations and  interests in teaching, and to explore why you want to study with us. At the interview stage, your suitability for teaching will be judged, including your subject knowledge for teaching and potential to demonstrate proficiency with fundamental English and mathematics. If any shortfall is identified, you may be required to complete some additional work before starting the programme. During the programme, your subject knowledge and fundamental English and mathematics will be developed and assessed to ensure you reach the required level.The interview process is likely to include a presentation, group discussion, reading and writing tasks to probe subject knowledge, and an individual face-to-face interview. Tutors will use the process to make judgements about your potential to be trained as a teacher in your chosen subject area and your suitability to work with children.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Your course is designed to include 120 days of school-based training. This includes placements in a minimum of two secondary schools, selected carefully so that you experience different approaches to school management and organisation as well as varied teaching and learning styles. You will teach classes across the 11-16 age range and have the opportunity for post 16 enhancement. Each placement provides a sustained teaching experience with a gradual increase in responsibility for planning, teaching and assessment. Within the placements, you will be supported by school-based mentors as well as your University Tutor. You will also have the opportunity to have a placement at an alternative learning environment such as a pupil referral unit, Special Needs School or museum. The Middlesex ITT Partnership extends across Greater London and also includes some schools in neighbouring local authorities, such as Hertfordshire.","personalQualities":"To strengthen applications it is recommended that you have obtained, or have set up to obtain, recent and relevant experience within state secondary school settings in England.","otherRequirements":"\r\nYou must  be judged suitable to work with children after being subject to a Disclosure and Barring Service enhanced disclosure check and other required background checks.
