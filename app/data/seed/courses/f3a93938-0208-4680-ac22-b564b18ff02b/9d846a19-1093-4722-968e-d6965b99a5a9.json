It is accredited by the Department for Education and will equip you to become a primary school teacher in Key Stages One and Two (ages 5-11). Successful completion of the course will provide you with a recommendation for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS), awarded by the Department for Education and a PGCE, awarded by Durham University. \r\n\r\nWe place a firm emphasis on your entitlement to the Core Content Framework throughout the PGCE course, to fully prepare you to be an Early Career Teacher and beyond.  In addition to a clear understanding of how to meet the Teachers’ Standards, we will ensure that you start your school placement with a sound foundation of pedagogy relevant to primary education.  The course offers a blend of research and experience in the classroom to start you on your successful career as a reflective practitioner.  It gives you the opportunity to evaluate the strengths of new initiatives in teaching, and opportunities to put them into practice.\r\n\r\nSubject pedagogy (how to teach the primary subjects for understanding) is explored in an innovative university / partnership model known as the Cluster model of School Training Centres. The Cluster model promotes a ‘shared space’ where university tutors and classroom practitioners work together. This model provides trainees with the ‘best of both worlds’, opportunities to work with research active University professionals with an abundance of experience in teacher training, and school practitioners with experience of delivering the National Curriculum and are experts in current classroom practice. The ITE course is delivered using a blended approach and follows a ‘knowledge rich’ curriculum that is current and evidence based. \r\n\r\nThe university-based sessions focus on a weekly specific pedagogical theme, which is integrated with sessions devoted to the Core and Foundation Primary Subjects, delivered by subject specialists.  Your understandings of key concepts and classroom practice are explored in small Teacher Learning Community groups, to prepare you for your school placements.  Wellbeing is at the heart of the PGCE course, and you will receive personal, constructive, and friendly support from your University and School-Based Tutors and our Wellbeing Team. \r\n \r\nApplicants should note that this programme starts earlier than the standard university term.\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Recruitment to the course is robust and designed to identify candidates who are resilient and who can thrive on our programme. \r\n\r\nCandidates invited to attend an interview will receive an email with full details of an allocated interview slot. In the event of continuing Covid restrictions, the interview will be held online via Zoom, using a similar format to the one outlined below.\r\n\r\nThe interview will explore the interviewee’s potential and previous knowledge, skills or experience that is beneficial to the candidate’s role as a trainee teacher.  There will also be an opportunity for candidates to ask any questions they may have to the course team. \r\n\r\nThe interview offers candidates different ways to demonstrate their potential to be successful. The first opportunity is a short presentation, prepared in advance, and this is followed by several interview questions relating to the teaching profession and contemporary issues. The final activity is an in-tray task that is designed to highlight a candidate’s logical thinking and organisation.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The university-based sessions complement the school-based experience you will gain in schools in the Durham University Schools Partnership, which will be a minimum of 120 days across the three terms.  The responsibility for training is shared between schools and the University, providing a supportive professional environment in which you can develop your knowledge, skills, understanding and expertise. \r\n\r\nOur School Training Centre Coordinators and Class-Based Mentors work in partnership with the University to give you the best possible encouragement and further development as you progress towards your Qualified Teacher Status. The Durham University Schools Partnership has schools across the North-East region and students are required to travel independently to these. \r\n\r\nThe Partnership Team work hard to ensure that travel expectations are reasonable.","personalQualities":"During the recruitment process, we will be evaluating your potential to become an effective teacher.  Our preferred applicants will have the following qualities:\r\n\r\n* a desire to teach and work with young people from all backgrounds\r\n* effective communication skills and a collegiate approach\r\n* a passion for subject pedagogy in primary education and strong subject knowledge\r\n* a commitment to teaching and the determination to succeed\r\n* consistently high standards of personal and professional conduct upholding the public trust in the profession\r\n","otherRequirements":"Admission to the course is subject to a satisfactory medical report, as you are required to meet the standards for ‘Fitness to Teach’. It is important that you disclose any medical condition or disability so that we can look at the best way of supporting you if you are offered a place on the course.\r\n\r\nYou will be subject to safeguarding checks which include an enhanced DBS check.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:46:48.056Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-28T13:10:16.101Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
