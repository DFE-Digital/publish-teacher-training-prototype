Time is spent in the University and in classroom placements, ensuring that by the end of the course, trainees are confident professionals ready to begin teaching in secondary schools.\r\n\r\nCentral to our geography teacher education course is the basic tenant that all young people, regardless of social class, race, ethnicity, gender or ability can learn and enjoy geography, and that geography, as a discipline, has a significant contribution to make to the broader aims of education. We argue that for young people living in a fast-changing world a high-quality geography education is essential.\r\n\r\nThe idea of geography as a school 'subject' is central to the design of our course. By this we mean that the course enables beginning teachers to understand how their own passion for geography translates into interesting, challenging and worthwhile learning for young people. During the course, beginning teachers gain experience of appropriate ways to teach geography whilst at the same time considering what kinds of geographies are fit for a 21st century education system.","interviewProcess":"You will be invited to an interview with one of the Rutland Teaching Alliance partner schools as part of the selection process.
