The 38-week course will prepare you to teach the 5-11 age range.  \r\n\r\nThe course starts early in September with a 2-week intensive induction programme at the University of Bedfordshire (UoB).  Your first teaching placement will run between mid-September and December, and the second placement runs between January and June.  One placement is in Key Stage One (KS1) and the other will be in KS2.  Throughout the course, you will spend four days each week in your placement school and travel to UoB each Friday for professional studies.  \r\n\r\nOur partner primary schools are located across Fenland (NE Cambridgeshire) and range from small, village schools to some of the largest primaries in the country.  We endeavour to minimise travel time to your placement schools.   In each placement, you will have a named mentor who is an experienced teacher responsible for supporting your professional development.  \r\n\r\nAt the University, teaching is through lectures, seminars and workshops with opportunities to work independently and collaboratively.  This Masters level course is divided into three units, two of which carry 30 credits each.  The taught elements include:  Perspectives, Values, Principals and Beliefs in Education, The Reflective Journal, Learning and Teaching the Curriculum.  Course content presents issues that relate to learning and teaching, classroom management, assessment and reporting, as well as topics such as behaviour and inclusion.  There are course assignments but no formal exams and the continuous assessment of teaching is based on achieving the national standards for QTS.  \r\n\r\nOn successful completion of the course, you are very likely to be offered a teaching position.  Indeed, all primary trainees who completed our course gained employment, the vast majority within Fenland schools.","interviewProcess":"All suitable applicants will be invited to interview at Lionel Walden Primary School, Doddington.  This interview will take the form of a personal interview with the Head/Senior Leadership of Lionel Walden plus an activity where you will be required to work with a small group of children.\r\n\r\nYou will then travel to the University of Bedfordshire for a personal interview with representatives from their teacher training department.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We work with a large number of partner primary schools across Fenland where experience has shown us that the trainees will be well-mentored and supported.  Each trainee will complete a Placement A (Sept-Dec) and a Placement B (Jan-June).  One of these must be in Key Stage 1 and the other in Key Stage 2.  Trainees work in their placement schools from Monday to Thursday each week and then learn at the University of Bedford each Friday.\r\n\r\nInitially trainees spend time observing good classroom teaching, working with smaller groups and becoming familiar with the school and the teaching practices already used in it.  Over the year, as a trainee's skills and confidence develop, the amount of teaching time will increase.  In each placement the trainee is linked to a mentor, an experienced teacher who will be able to support their professional development.\r\n\r\nWhen placing trainees, we take into account their home location and try to match them with a school that minimises their travel time.  All our placement schools are in Fenland.  If a trainee has a particular link with a Fenland primary school (e.g. they have been volunteering there) and they wish to have one placement in that school, then if the Head of the school is willing and able to do this, we will organise for this to happen.\r\n\r\nMany of our trainees have been offered jobs in the schools in which they carried out their placements.","personalQualities":"\r\n*Good communication skills\r\nTeachers are required to communicate with a wide range of people, from pupils to parents and other teachers, in both written and verbal form.  These skills are essential for applicants.\r\n\r\n*Commitment to teaching\r\nTeaching is an extremely rewarding career that can make a real difference to people's lives.  However, it is a challenging and demanding career both in terms of training and the role itself.  We expect to see interest and commitment to teaching within applications.\r\n\r\n*Enthusiasm\r\nExperience demonstrates that where teachers are enthusiastic about what they are teaching, the more responsive pupils tend to be","otherRequirements":"*School experience\r\nApplicants are recommended to have a minimum of 10 days recent and relevant experience of working with children in a UK mainstream primary school by the start of the course.  Ideally they should have completed at least 5 days KS1/KS2 experience at the time of interview but this is not a requirement. Please contact head@lionelwalden.cambs.sch.uk if you need help to organise some work experience before applying.\r\n\r\n* Desire to work in Fenland\r\n\r\n* DBS and Medical checks\r\nAll course offers will be subject to receiving DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) and medical clearance.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:51:18.470Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-23T21:40:12.462Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2023"}
