It is identical to the University of Reading's course [2LYQ](http://www.reading.ac.uk/ready-to-study/study/subject-area/education-pg/pgce-secondary-education-design-and-technology.aspx). Applicants to this course will however be interviewed by the Wokingham Federation and if successful will train in two Federation schools. They will follow the same course as 2LYQ and will become members of the University in the same way as all the other successful applicants to this course.\r\n\r\nThe course supports its trainees to become reflective professionals who are able to secure the very best for all children. We work with them to be resilient, creative and inclusive. With the highest expectations of learning, progress and development, trainees inspire young people to become confident, active citizens who are able to cope with the fast-moving demands of the 21st century.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the partnership between the Wokingham Federation and the University of Reading is to train excellent practitioners who have a positive impact on their pupils. This is accompanied by the recognition that excellent teachers continue to develop throughout their careers and never stop learning. Our intention therefore is that trainees should take ownership of their development during this year of training and establish the habits of reflective practice that will sustain them throughout their careers.\r\n\r\nTrainees will examine a range of pedagogical approaches to design and technology teaching and explore all aspects of secondary design and technology, including specialist expertise in areas such as textiles, resistant materials, electronics, food technology and graphics.\r\n\r\nTo enable trainees to reach their potential as a fully qualified teacher, the course involves both a practical and theoretical approach. Interactive and discussion-based teaching techniques encourage them to engage, reflect and challenge.\r\n\r\nTrainees will learn through a series of practical seminars and workshops in purpose-built design studios with extensive resources and equipment as well as in school workshop spaces. \r\n\r\nBetween the campus environment and the diversity embedded within the Federation schools, our trainees develop a strong identity as beginner teachers and educators of the future. Please see [School Direct with the University of Reading](http://www.reading.ac.uk/education/pgce-qts/ioe-secondary-school-direct.aspx) for more details.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Applicants called to interview will be interviewed at a Federation school on behalf of The Federation.\r\n\r\nThe interview process will consist of:\r\n\r\n* an introductory meeting\r\n* a written task\r\n* a teaching task with a small group of students\r\n* a formal interview\r\n\r\nThere may also be additional tasks, for example to meet with a student panel or to observe a lesson and then share observations.\r\n\r\nSome applicants may be interviewed remotely. When this is the case, the teaching task will be replaced with a presentation to the interviewing panel. \r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Trainees will work in two of The Federation's nine mainstream School Direct secondary schools. Please see [The Wokingham Federation](http://wokinghamfederation.co.uk/home/schools/) website for details of the schools.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the year, all trainees will have experience of teaching all years from Years 7 - 13, including working with both GCSE and A Level groups.\r\n\r\nTo ensure they are fully supported during the course, trainees have a mentor at their schools and a tutor with the University, both of whom work closely with them throughout the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for applications from people who have the desire, passion and determination to be outstanding teachers. The Wokingham Federation is proud of its schools and they are  all keen to work with trainees who would like to be a part of it, at least for a year and possibly for longer.","otherRequirements":"If you accept an offer from us, you will also be required to complete Occupational Health and Disclosure Barring Service (DBS) Enhanced Disclosure checks successfully.\r\n\r\nThese checks are required to ensure you meet the Department for Educationâ€™s requirements for physical and mental fitness to teach, as well as assessing your suitability for working with children.\r\n\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2022-01-13T14:13:29.755Z","updatedAt":"2022-01-13T14:19:12.800Z"}
