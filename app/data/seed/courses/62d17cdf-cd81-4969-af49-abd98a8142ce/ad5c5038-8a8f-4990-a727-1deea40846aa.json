You will be interviewed by the head of department, a member of the leadership team and a teacher with responsibility for initial teacher training. Before the interview day, but as part of the interview process, you will be expected to arrange a visit to the school. On the interview day itself you will be asked to observe a lesson and discuss what you notice and you will be asked to work with a small group of students for part of a lesson, supporting them through an activity prepared by their teacher.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Schools within the JCTN identify the subjects in which they wish to train a teacher. This means that chemistry is only offered in those specific schools. If you are offered and accept a place in that school, it then is designated as your home school and the bulk of your teaching practice will take place there.   In addition to your home placement, you will have a second placement that will be in a different school within the network.  All of our schools are located in West Dorset, Chard and East Devon.  All of the placement schools are designated as good or outstanding by Ofsted and there is opportunity for 16-18 experience if desired.","personalQualities":"","otherRequirements":"","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:49:18.455Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-04T14:19:28.125Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2023"}
