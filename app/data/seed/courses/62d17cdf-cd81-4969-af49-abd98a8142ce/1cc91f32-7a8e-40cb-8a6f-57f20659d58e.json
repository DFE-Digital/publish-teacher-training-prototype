We expect you to take a high level of responsibility for your own professional learning and the course includes both taught seminars and workshops and directed or independent study activities which allow your professional learning to be tailored to your needs and interests. In addition, you will have the opportunity to engage with the broader professional field related to English, such as working with the Royal Shakespeare Company, meeting children’s authors, and being involved with national or regional arts-based projects.\r\n\r\nThe course is informed by research in the Centre for Research in Writing, giving you first-hand access to the latest research on classroom practice in English.\r\n\r\nThe programme has three fully integrated components:\r\n\r\n*Secondary Education and Professional Studies Module\r\nThe Professional Studies component introduces you to key educational ideas and principles within a range of educational contexts. The module is followed throughout the year with both University and school-based elements and is concerned with classroom issues, whole school issues and the role of education in the wider society.\r\n\r\n*Secondary Professional Learning Module\r\nCentral to school-based work is the development of your ability to meet the standards of professional competence which trainees must demonstrate in order to meet national standards for the award of QTS.\r\n\r\n*Secondary English Subject Knowledge and Pedagogy Module\r\nThe principal aims of the module are to equip students with a comprehensive understanding of the background issues and practice of the current teaching of English and Drama in the secondary school, and to enable them toachieve QTS. In addition, the module seeks to nurture reflective and autonomous professional practitioners who are able to identify strengths and areas for development in their subject knowledge and pedagogy, through evaluating current professional practice in relationship to developments in research and curriculum theory\r\nRead more at (https://www.exeter.ac.uk/teachertraining/secondary/english/#I3US026I4PXkQD28.99)\r\n\r\nThere are two principal strands to the assessment of the Exeter PGCE course. The first is the written component and the second, the practical component. During the year, English students complete two written assignments, each one directly linking the university and school-based aspects of the course.\r\n\r\nThe practical assessment of teaching is to ensure that all students meet the requirements set by the NCTL for all Initial Teacher Training courses.\r\n\r\nFor further information about this course please see https://www.exeter.ac.uk/teachertraining/\r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Interviews will take place in the home school. You will be interviewed by the head of department, a member of the leadership team and a teacher with responsibility for initial teacher training. Before the interview day, but as part of the interview process, you will be expected to arrange a visit to the school. On the interview day itself you will be asked to observe a lesson and discuss what you notice and you will be asked to work with a small group of students for part of a lesson, supporting them through an activity prepared by their teacher.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"\r\nJCTSA schools decide on an individual basis in which subjects they wish to offer training. This means that you are applying to a specific school to study your subject. Your contrasting school experience will be as close as possible to your home school but you will need access to a car.\r\nThere are two school placements. The majority of your in-school experience is done in your home school. This is the school to which you applied for your place.   In addition to your home placement, you will have a second placement that will be in a different school within the network.  All of our schools are located in West Dorset, Chard and East Devon.  All of the placement schools are designated as good or outstanding by Ofsted and there is opportunity for 16-18 experience if desired.\r\n","personalQualities":null,"otherRequirements":null,"status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:49:18.366Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-04T14:22:45.445Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2024"}
