We have a large cohort of trainees on the 2019-2020 secondary programme; in addition to this, we also have several trainees on the primary course. \r\n\r\nWe provide a very special, school based training experience in partnership with [TES Institute] (https://www.tes.com/) who have a reputation for innovative on-line learning materials, especially in shortage subjects, with its Subject Knowledge Enhancement courses.\r\n\r\nThere are over 20 schools in our Partnership, all judged to be 'Outstanding' or 'Good' by Ofsted. The Partnership has been in existence for over 6 years, which ensures that cooperation between the schools is established and is one of its strengths. \r\n\r\nSubject Knowledge Enhancement (SKE) is provided on-line as part of the course delivery. Several days are spent in a local primary school in order to experience KS2 teaching; in addition, there will be visits to a Special School (Special Educational Needs), a hearing-impaired unit and also to Heathcote School in North East London to experience teaching pupils for whom English is an additional language. \r\n\r\nEach trainee will record evidence to meet the teaching standards and all supporting reports and documentation via the TES Institute Learning Environment and will have access to their library to research the 3 assignments through this facility. \r\n\r\nFor successful applicants, there will be an induction day in July after which you will start at your own school on the first day of term (having spent some time visiting to get to know the staff, school and its routines).\r\n\r\nYou will be treated as a member of staff, attend staff meetings and all development training days. All of the Mentors have been trained in mentoring/coaching skills and will be effective classroom observers with feedback skills.  ","interviewProcess":"The interview process will comprise of:\r\n\r\n* teaching a lesson for about 30-40 minutes\r\n* an interview\r\n* a written and a numeracy test\r\n\r\nThis will be conducted by at least two people, one of which will have been 'Safer Recruitment' trained.\r\n\r\n(Please note that, due to Covid-19, the interview format may be subject to variation and conducted remotely.)","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will be trained in schools which have finely developed systems in place to nurture development of the whole teacher and equip the trainee teacher with the 'tools of the trade'. \r\n\r\nEach trainee is placed in one school for the majority of the placement and the training will be provided by expert practitioners. A dedicated Professional Studies Programme (called Face2Face) takes place each week, mainly at a central location in Ongar, or at one of our other partner schools in West Essex or Chelmsford. Our Face2Face programme also offers many personalised, subject-specific training sessions with subject leaders across our partnership. \r\n\r\nIn the Spring Term, there is a 6 week second placement in a contrasting school setting - usually within one of the partnership schools. Some of the schools in the partnership have an 11-18 intake and offer KS5 opportunities. All of the schools are fully comprehensive. Several schools have a discreet Christian ethos. \r\n\r\nOur Partnership Schools are: \r\n\r\nWest Essex: \r\n* Davenant Foundation School, Loughton (Lead School) \r\n* West Hatch High School, Chigwell \r\n* Roding Valley High School, Loughton \r\n* Heathcote School & Science College, Chingford \r\n* The Ongar Academy, Ongar \r\n\r\nHarlow\r\n* Stewards Academy, Harlow \r\n* Passmores Academy, Harlow \r\n* St. Mark's West Essex Catholic School, Harlow \r\n\r\nChelmsford\r\n* The Boswells School, Chelmsford \r\n* Great Baddow High School, Chelmsford \r\n* Moulsham High School, Chelmsford \r\n* The Sandon School, Chelmsford \r\n* Chelmer Valley High School, Chelmsford \r\n* Sir John Payne, Chelmsford \r\n* Anglo European School, Ingatestone \r\n* Helena Romanes School, Great Dunmow\r\n* William De Ferrers School, South Woodham Ferrers \r\n* Chelmsford County High School for Girls\r\n \r\nHerts/Essex\r\n* Joyce Frankland Academy, Newport \r\n* King James Academy, Royston\r\n\r\nHavering\r\n* Frances Bardsley Academy for Girls, Romford\r\n* Royal Liberty School, Romford\r\n* Emerson Park Academy, Hornchurch\r\n","personalQualities":"","otherRequirements":"For E-Bacc subjects, there is Subject Knowledge Enhancement, which may be a condition in the offer of a place.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:47:54.147Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-15T11:47:02.643Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2023"}
