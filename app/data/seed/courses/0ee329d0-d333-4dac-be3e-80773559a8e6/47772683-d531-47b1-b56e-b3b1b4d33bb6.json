The Passmores Cooperative Learning Community (PCLC) in Harlow and the Chelmsford Learning Partnership (CLP), a multi-academy trust based in Springfield, Chelmsford.

Their vision is to offer the highest standard of education for all, both in the local communities and beyond. \r\n\r\nIn Harlow, our Primary training programme centres around several schools, including Purford Green Primary School, Potter Street Academy and The Downs Primary School.
