Providing you with a solid foundation of professional awareness and understanding, it will build and develop your competence and confidence in imparting your subject knowledge to young people. Building on your English studies at undergraduate level, you will be encouraged to develop effective classroom and teaching skills whilst considering the theories, policies and developments within English teaching.\r\n\r\nYou will acquire an awareness of the teaching and learning strategies which will help you develop the reading, writing, speaking and listening abilities of pupils across the 11-16 range with post 16 enhancement. Teaching related areas such as media and drama, as well as the post-16 curriculum, will also be explored during the course. You will develop the strategies and expertise necessary to teach an understanding and appreciation of both language and literature which will hopefully stay with pupils throughout their lives.\r\n\r\nNewman understands that visual, interactive methods of teaching are an exciting way to make learning more fun and engaging for students. A strength of the course is the focus on showing you how to use classroom technology and multimedia programmes effectively when teaching English.
