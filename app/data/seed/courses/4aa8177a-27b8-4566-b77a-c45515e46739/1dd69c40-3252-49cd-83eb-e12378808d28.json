You will develop a good understanding of maths pedagogy and how to help children grasp complex ideas. Providing you with a solid foundation of professional awareness and understanding, the course will foster and develop your competence and confidence in imparting your subject knowledge to young people.\r\n\r\nYou will need a UK Bachelors Degree (or recognised equivalent qualification) of which 50% content must be related to the named subject; and this will be a condition of any offer where the degree has not already been awarded. If your degree does not include enough mathematics, or if you just need a refresher course, the Department for Education sponsors several Subject Knowledge Enhancement (SKE) courses. \r\n\r\nTeaching sessions at Newman comprise an exploration of how mathematical topics develop in the 11-16 with post 16 enhancement age range with a brief exploration of Key Stage 2 techniques and how ideas progress at A level. You will be involved in sessions that focus on doing maths, exploring why techniques such as long multiplication work and how children can be guided in their learning.\r\n\r\nYou will focus not only on how children will develop their mathematical knowledge and understanding but how to increase their confidence in applying it. To assess children’s progress, you will explore potential errors and misconceptions and how they might be observed and remedied. Extensive use will be made of ICT to illustrate and model mathematical ideas. This will furnish you with relevant skills that can be taken into the classroom.\r\n\r\n• As a graduate you will be highly sought after by head teachers as mathematics is a shortage subject. You may also be eligible for a £25,000 scholarship (see Postgraduate Bursaries for more information)\r\n\r\n• Newman lecturers use a variety of interactive teaching methods including lectures, seminars and individual tutorials which encourage participation\r\n\r\n• You will experience a range of assessment formats including coursework, presentations and practical teaching ability","interviewProcess":"Our aim is to make this a two way informative process that is as enjoyable as possible, despite being an interview.

You will also benefit from Newman’s excellent partnerships with schools in the West Midlands. The programme consists of 40 weeks of full-time study (from early September to the beginning of July), and you can expect to spend at least 24 of those weeks in schools.\r\n\r\nYou will be supported through these placements by experienced teaching colleagues, including subject mentors – teachers trained to provide beginning teachers with support and guidance. Partnership tutors from Newman will also be allocated to provide advice and support.\r\n\r\nYou will be encouraged to explore further aspects of mathematics education with groups of pupils across the age and ability range, including those with special educational needs.","personalQualities":"The quality and variety of your personal statement is an important factor in the decision to call you to interview. Candidates must attend an interview at Newman University.","otherRequirements":"Obtaining a Disclosure and Barring (DBS) clearance and meeting the requirements for Fitness to Teach are also required.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-12T13:49:30.803Z","updatedAt":"2021-08-06T09:48:57.988Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"}
