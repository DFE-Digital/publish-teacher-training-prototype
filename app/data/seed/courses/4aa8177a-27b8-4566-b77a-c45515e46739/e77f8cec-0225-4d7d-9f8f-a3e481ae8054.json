The course combines academic study and application of history education with a range of school experiences to prepare you for teaching secondary school students across the 11-16 age range. Approximately two-thirds of your time will be spent in schools developing your practical teaching skills with the support of experienced history teachers.   A wide range of teaching methods are incorporated into the course, including lectures, group discussion, practical workshops, trainee-led presentations and peer reviews.  The course is designed to provoke thought, challenge assumptions and help develop you as a reflective practitioner of the subject, so that you can enter the teaching profession with clear educational priorities and the skills with which to achieve them. \r\n\r\nYou will explore what is the use or relevance of studying History and why it matters what happened long ago? You will be able to educate pupils in how to interpret the past and the legacies of the past in the present. Understanding the linkages between past and present is absolutely basic for a good understanding of the condition of being human. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the programme is designed to develop you as professional history teachers confident to challenge misconceptions and teach with passion and authority.  A thinking skills approach and enquiry based learning underpin the course as these have been shown to motivate and interest young learners as well as enhance their understanding of the world in which we live.  \r\n\r\nThe PGCE course has both a pedagogical and practical aspect.  After a short period of time in University preparing you for school experience, much of the course is spent in schools in a programme that gives you an opportunity to gain an advanced understanding of secondary schools and skills in classroom management and lesson delivery. During the year you will gain experience of teaching in at least two secondary schools and will acquire high level skills in the application of new technologies in teaching and learning.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Our aim is to make this a two way informative process that is as enjoyable as possible, despite being an interview.
