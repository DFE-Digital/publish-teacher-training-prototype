This can also be covered by the student loan.\r\n\r\nWe do not have an integral PGCE. So the course fee does not include a PGCE. Trainees who wish to gain a PGCE as well as QTS can add the academic award through our higher education partner at an additional cost. The PGCE can be undertaken alongside the ITT training programme. ","aboutCourse":"This ITT course is a school-based, school-led, blended learning programme, comprising a sequenced balance of training and independent study provided by e-Qualitas. The eQ training approach includes core face to face days, subject specific and pedagogy blended learning resources, learning tasks and theory papers. Start dates are flexible as we have rolling recruitment and a cycle of training days starts each term for the group of full-time trainees starting then.\r\n\r\nOur curriculum has a shared vision, is well sequenced and cohesively integrated in schools that prepares trainees for the reality of the classroom through sustainable workload and support. Mastery of the eQ ITT curriculum is at the heart, sequentially supporting trainee development through ‘learning that’ and’ learning how to’ across the core areas of behaviour management, classroom practice and adaptive teaching, subject knowledge and pedagogy, curriculum, assessment and professional behaviours.  e-Qualitas has a comprehensive range of best practice research-based learning resources that come together as a coherent high-quality training offer for our trainees. \r\n\r\nA trainee’s learning journey is based round Mastery of the eQ ITT curriculum including the DfE Core Content Framework (CCF). The ITT Core Content Framework has been designed to support trainee development in 5 core areas –behaviour management, pedagogy, curriculum, assessment and professional behaviours. The ITT Core Content Framework mirrors the Early Career Framework (ECF) and is congruent with the 8 Teachers’ Standards, \r\nAssessment.\r\n\r\nOur trainees spend most of their time in school. They move from co-teaching with experienced staff to independent teaching (with support and advice from other teachers). Most trainees are teaching about a 50% timetable by a third of the way through their course, rising to 60% in the middle term, and rising again in the final term. A 6-week placement in a contrasting school usually takes place in the middle of the training period. Trainees typically attend about 10 training days plus phase/ subject specialist days in the centre (currently central London, Covent Garden). Some of these days are likely to be offered as blended virtual learning days going forward.  There is a comprehensive VLE to support independent study, and pro-forma that can be used for lesson planning, observations, and to structure evaluative writing etc. A tutor from e-Qualitas visits for a whole day each half term. \r\n","interviewProcess":"The first interview is by the school that is interested in having the applicant as a trainee teacher. If the applicant is successful, the school's feedback enables e-Qualitas to make a conditional offer of a place. This is confirmed after the necessary conditions have been met, and an e-Qualitas tutor has visited the school. The tutor checks that the applicant is indeed suitable for entry to initial teacher training, checks that the school will make appropriate arrangements for the in-school training, and works out the individualised training plan.\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Trainees commence their journey towards Mastery of the eQ ITT curriculum and will be supported with research, training resources and on going tracking including six visits by an e-Qualitas tutor, who will review progress and adapt the programme to meet individual, learning needs.\r\n\r\nDuring school placements, trainees benefit from working alongside experienced teachers. Trainees have opportunities to observe excellent teaching before experimenting with approaches to teaching and learning across the secondary age range, during which time they are supervised and supported by teachers and tutors. They begin with a light teaching timetable which is gradually increased as they become more skilled and confident.\r\n\r\nThe main focus of this training programme is classroom practice and the development of the knowledge, skills and understanding needed to ensure that pupils make excellent progress in their learning. Trainees are supported by both a school based mentor and a tutor working in close partnership to support them. They are experienced and skilled in classroom observation, giving feedback and setting targets for development. Trainees have full support in developing their behaviour management skills throughout the year. \r\n\r\nTrainees have a six week second placement in a contrasting school, usually another local partnership school, to enhance their experience by giving them the opportunity to plan, teach and assess in a different context.","personalQualities":"The e-Qualitas course suits trainees who are independent learners who are self-motivated and able to manage their time well. You must be reflective and analytical, and have really good inter-personal skills. You must want to become an excellent teacher so that the pupils you teach do really well at school. \r\n\r\nWe also look for the attributes that make for success in the classroom eg strong subject expertise, flexibility, purposefulness, creativity, the capacity to learn from experience. ","otherRequirements":"Relevant work experience is helpful because it puts the applicant into a stronger position at the start of the training period. \r\n\r\nDBS checks have to be passed, obviously, and referees should endorse the applicant's capacity to become a successful teacher. \r\n\r\nCopies of the originals of all the applicant's qualifications certificates are held by e-Qualitas, together with ID documents (passport; photo driving licence or two utility bills or similar from within the last 3 months, showing the applicant's name and address).
