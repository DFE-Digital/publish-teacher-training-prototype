We support them to be resilient, creative and inclusive. With the highest expectations of learning, progress and development, they inspire young people to become confident, active citizens who are able to cope with the fast-moving demands of the 21st century.\r\n\r\nThe course offers considerable practical experience which is grounded in rigorous educational research. \r\n\r\nThe aim of the partnership of the University of Reading and the Wokingham Federation is to train excellent practitioners who have a positive impact on their pupils. This is accompanied by the recognition that excellent teachers continue to develop throughout their careers and never stop learning. Our intention is that you should take ownership of your development during this year of training and establish the habits of reflective practice that will sustain you throughout your career.\r\n\r\nBetween the campus environment and the diversity embedded within the Federation schools, our trainees develop a strong identity as beginner teachers and educators of the future. Please see [School Direct with the University of Reading](http://www.reading.ac.uk/education/pgce-qts/ioe-secondary-school-direct.aspx) for more details.\r\n\r\nOur commitment to ensuring equal opportunities is evident through our pastoral support which recognises and nurtures the potential in every trainee.
