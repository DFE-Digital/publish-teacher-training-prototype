It is identical to the University of Reading's course [2LYQ](http://www.reading.ac.uk/ready-to-study/study/subject-area/education-pg/pgce-secondary-education-design-and-technology.aspx). Applicants to this course will follow the same course as 2LYQ and will become members of the University in the same way as all the other successful applicants to this course.\r\n\r\nThe course supports its trainees to become reflective professionals, able to secure the very best for all children. We work with them to be resilient, creative and inclusive. With the highest expectations of learning, progress and development, trainees inspire young people to become confident, active citizens who are able to cope with the fast-moving demands of the 21st century.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the partnership of the Wokingham Federation and the University of Reading is to train excellent practitioners who have a positive impact on their pupils. This is accompanied by the recognition that excellent teachers continue to develop throughout their careers and never stop learning. Our intention therefore is that trainees should take ownership of their development during this year of training and establish the habits of reflective practice that will sustain them throughout their career.\r\n\r\nTrainees will examine a range of pedagogical approaches to design and technology teaching and explore all aspects of secondary design and technology, including specialist expertise in areas such as textiles, resistant materials, electronics, food technology and graphics.\r\n\r\nTo enable trainees to reach their potential as a fully qualified teacher, the course involves both a practical and theoretical approach. Interactive and discussion-based teaching techniques encourage engage to engage, reflect and challenge.\r\n\r\nTrainees will learn through a series of practical seminars and workshops in purpose-built design studios with extensive resources and equipment as well as in school workshop spaces. \r\n\r\nBetween the campus environment and the diversity embedded within the Federation schools, our trainees develop a strong identity as beginner teachers and educators of the future.

When this is the case, the teaching task will be replaced with a presentation to the interviewing panel. \r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Trainees will work in two of The Federation's nine mainstream School Direct secondary schools.
