The PGCE (60 masters credits) is delivered by and accredited by The University of Sussex, whose ITT provision has been graded as outstanding by Ofsted. Trainees have the opportunity to go to The University of Sussex on a number of occasions throughout the year to access keynote lectures and the PGCE element of the course is delivered at one of the two lead schools within the SCITT.\r\n\r\nThe course offers you a weekly General Professional Studies (GPS) session lasting 3 hours, which is held at SJB School in Woking. In these sessions you will receive practical strategies and ideas to develop your practice within the classroom. Areas of pedagogy covered within these sessions include: assessment for learning, smart marking, lesson planning, behaviour management and differentiation. Our Non-Salaried and SCITT courses are awarded with QTS and PGCE carrying 60 masters credits (awarded in partnership with the University of Sussex). Our salaried and apprenticeship courses lead to QTS only.\r\n\r\nAlongside your General Professional Studies, all trainees receive subject specific training, which is led by one of the schools within the partnership. All subject hubs within the partnership have been chosen for their renowned reputation as training centres and outstanding levels of learning and teaching as well as results. Business Studies subject training gives trainees a weekly dedicated session focusing on subject related topics, preparing you to teach Business Studies to a high level within the classroom. Areas of training include planning an effective scheme of work, assisting students to develop analytical and critical thinking skills, differentiation, preparing students for examinations and equipping you with the skills to teach the full range of business subjects across Key Stages 4 and 5 (14 to 19 years). \r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Once we receive your application through UCAS, Teach SouthEast will make a call to interview within approximately one week.
