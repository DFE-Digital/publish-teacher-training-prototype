It is identical to the University of Reading's course [F3X1](http://www.reading.ac.uk/ready-to-study/study/subject-area/education-pg/pgce-secondary-education-physics.aspx). Applicants to this course, 2662, will however be interviewed by the Wokingham Federation and if successful will train in two Federation schools. They will follow the same course as F3X1 and will become members of the University in the same way as all the other successful applicants to this course.\r\n\r\nThe course supports its trainees to become reflective professionals who are able to secure the very best for all children. We work with them to be resilient, creative and inclusive. With the highest expectations of learning, progress and development, trainees inspire young people to become confident, active citizens who are able to cope with the fast-moving demands of the 21st century.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the partnership between the Wokingham Federation and the University of Reading is to train excellent practitioners who have a positive impact on their pupils. This is accompanied by the recognition that excellent teachers continue to develop throughout their careers and never stop learning. Our intention therefore is that trainees should take ownership of their development during this year of training and establish the habits of reflective practice that will sustain them throughout their careers.\r\n\r\nTraining to teach in one of the sciences at the University of Reading is an immersive experience that utilises many modes of delivery and participation, with active learning at its core. Trainees will develop their skills throughout the programme so that they are fully prepared to share their love of learning and knowledge about science with the children they will be teaching.\r\n\r\nTeaching at the University takes place through a series of practical seminars and workshops in purpose-built science laboratories where interactive and discussion-based techniques will encourage trainees to engage, reflect and challenge. They will take part in activities designed to help them to plan their teaching effectively and imaginatively, discovering how to evaluate their skills, particularly in terms of the quality of learning achieved by pupils.\r\n\r\nBetween the campus environment and the diversity embedded within the Federation schools, our trainees develop a strong identity as beginner teachers and educators of the future. Please see [School Direct with the University of Reading](http://www.reading.ac.uk/education/pgce-qts/ioe-secondary-school-direct.aspx) for more details.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Applicants called to interview will be interviewed at a Federation school on behalf of The Federation.\r\n\r\nThe interview process will consist of:\r\n\r\n* an introductory meeting\r\n* a written task\r\n* a teaching task with a small group of students\r\n* a formal interview\r\n\r\nThere may also be additional tasks, for example to meet with a student panel or to observe a lesson and then share observations.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible that applicants will have to be interviewed remotely. When this is the case, the teaching task will be replaced with a presentation to the interviewing panel. \r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Trainees will work in two of The Federation's nine mainstream School Direct secondary schools. Please see [The Wokingham Federation](http://wokinghamfederation.co.uk/home/schools/) website for details of the schools.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the year, all trainees will have experience of teaching all years from Years 7 - 13, including working with both GCSE and A Level groups.\r\n\r\nTo ensure they are fully supported during the course, trainees have a mentor at their schools and a tutor with the University, both of whom work closely with them throughout the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for applications from people who have the desire, passion and determination to be outstanding teachers. The Wokingham Federation is proud of its schools and they are  all keen to work with trainees who would like to be a part of it, at least for a year and possibly for longer.","otherRequirements":"If you accept an offer from us, you will also be required to complete Occupational Health and Disclosure Barring Service (DBS) Enhanced Disclosure checks successfully.\r\n\r\nThese checks are required to ensure you meet the Department for Education’s requirements for physical and mental fitness to teach, as well as assessing your suitability for working with children.\r\n\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:47:20.346Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-27T09:39:34.647Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2024"}
