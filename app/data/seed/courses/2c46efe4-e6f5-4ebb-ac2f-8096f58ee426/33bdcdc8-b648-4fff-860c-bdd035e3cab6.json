We firmly believe that if you want to be able to teach, the best way to do so is to learn from outstanding teacher practitioners; this means that your training is very much school based and ‘hands on’. \r\n\r\nYou will undertake placements in two of our carefully selected cluster schools; your first placement is from September to December and the second from January to June. On placement you will be given the chance to build up a teaching timetable, with the help of an experienced subject mentor and professional mentor. The programme will also allow you to gain a Post Graduate Certificate in Education; this will not only help you understand the mechanics of teaching, but also stay ahead of the game when it comes to employment.\r\n\r\nThe course also offers immeasurable support, both from placement schools and the University; this is in terms of your assignments, teaching practice and subject knowledge, as well as pastorally. Moreover, during the year you will also be fortunate enough to attend at least 20 school based training days, delivered by a wide range of experts, and 12 subject specific training days at the University. This will ensure you have all the knowledge you require to turn you into a confident, happy and successful teacher. Other exciting opportunities include a day at a primary school, conferences and a day in college to look at transition; however, the beauty of this programme is that we can also offer alternative placements/days out, if you have a particular area or institute you wish to specialise in.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, all of our cluster schools are and located within a small geographical area; this means you do not have to travel huge distances – great for those who have family or other commitments. Even the University, where you will attend for training, is conveniently located in Lancaster.\r\n\r\nFinally, due to the outstanding reputation of Bishop Rawstorne, as a teacher training provider, and our cluster schools as experts in initial teacher training, we guarantee you a fantastic experience and due to our extensive contacts within the area, the best possible chance of securing employment on completion of the course.\r\n","interviewProcess":"As a School Direct Associate Teacher, you will be trained jointly by our cluster of schools and the University of Cumbria and will benefit from a comprehensive and bespoke training programme, offered by a range of experts within our alliance.\r\n\r\nIt is our aim to recruit those candidates who we believe have the potential to become outstanding secondary teachers. Recruitment of applicants for the 2021 intake will take place throughout the year and will involve a half day selection process at Bishop Rawstorne Academy. It will include the following:\r\n\r\n•\tSubject knowledge presentation  \r\n•\tTimed written task, in response to pre-interview reading – the article will be sent to you to consider prior to the interview\r\n•\tInterview – with the School Direct Programme Lead and/or University Partner Lead or Cluster School Professional Mentor/Subject Specialist\r\n•\tSubject knowledge audit/assessment – so that we can support you with any gaps in knowledge\r\n\r\nWe also appreciate that an interview is a two way process and want to ensure that you will be happy working together with us. Therefore, on the day you attend the interview (subject to Covid 19 restrictions), you will also be given a tour around the school, the chance to speak to our current trainee teachers (where possible) and to ask any further questions you may have about the course. \r\n\r\nWe aim to give you a decision about the interview as soon as possible and at the latest within 24 hours.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Bishop Rawstorne Academy was one of the first schools nationally to offer the School Direct programme. As a an outstanding teacher trainer provider, we therefore pride ourselves on having developed a course that is not only unique, but meets the needs of all our trainee teachers. Each of our cluster schools, where you will be placed, have been chosen because they have an excellent reputation for training teachers and because over the years we have developed a stronger collaborative partnership. \r\n\r\nOn placement you will work within a subject area, and with a range of experts, who will support you closely as you become a more confident teacher. Each of the subject mentors has been specially trained so they act as mentors and then coaches, helping you to develop your practice. Moreover, as we are a forward thinking school, we are able to offer you a range of free CPD activities that will give you the edge over other trainees and afford many networking opportunities. \r\n\r\nAll of our six cluster schools are geographically close, based in Chorley, Preston, Croston and Leyland; this means that your transport time to work does not eat into your working day or your home life. In addition, as we have a close working relationship with our cluster schools, we ensure that our trainee teachers are told in the summer where their first placement school will be. In fact, many of our trainees enjoy visiting their placement school in the summer, relishing the prospect of meeting the team they will be working with and familiarising themselves with school life. \r\n\r\nThe age ranges you will teach at our cluster schools will be 11-16; however, we also offer the chance for you to experience a day at a primary school and a college. For those interested in working in specialist schools, this is something we can also look to accommodate.\r\n\r\nThe feedback we get from our trainees about our cluster schools is overwhelmingly positive and a large percentage of our trainees often end up being employed by one of our cluster schools, or another school within our wider alliance.","personalQualities":"Teaching is an extremely rewarding profession and we are keen to recruit tomorrow’s teachers. We are looking for people who are passionate about getting the best out of young people; have a genuine love for their subject; are hardworking and determined; who are good team players and who have a sense of humour and integrity. \r\n\r\nWe welcome applications from a range of backgrounds. If you want to make sure that teaching is right for you, or visit us, please contact the School Direct Lead, Peter Rawlinson, prawlinson@bishopr.co.uk, who will be more than happy to answer any questions you have.","otherRequirements":"* The DfE require you to be competent in fundamental English and mathematics before qualified teacher status can be awarded.\r\n\r\n* If you accept a formal offer of a place you will be required to meet the Department for Education's standards for physical and mental fitness to teach and clearance to work with children. \r\n\r\nFurther information, including a Declaration of Health questionnaire and details of how to apply for a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS, previously CRB) Enhanced Disclosure will be sent to you after you have \r\nfirmly accepted an offer.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:48:28.181Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-22T09:55:51.809Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2024"}
