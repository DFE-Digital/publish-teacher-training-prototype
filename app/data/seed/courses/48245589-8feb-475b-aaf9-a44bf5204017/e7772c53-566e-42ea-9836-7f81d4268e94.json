The PGCE course at the University of Leicester is divided into two halves, Phase A and Phase B, each with clearly delineated priorities to guide progress towards successful completion. \r\nTwo-thirds of the time (currently 24 weeks out of 36) is spent in schools, starting with a two week preliminary attachment to a Primary school with time spent in a Secondary school that its pupils transfer to.  You should consider this course if you have a passion for the subject and would like to contribute to young people's development by supporting them to acquire a knowledge base for life long skills in English. \r\n\r\nTaught sessions, tutorials, online and in-school support will ensure that, as a creative teacher, you can facilitate your own students' development as fully literate young adults who can understand, engage with and create a multiplicity of texts both within and beyond the classroom. \r\n\r\nYou will have taught sessions and in-school mentoring from some of the best practitioners in the field, and with their support, you will learn how to become an effective practitioner yourself. The programme will cover all areas of the National Curriculum for English. It will also address preparation for public examinations across the 16-19 age range and KS3 school-based assessments.\r\n\r\nThe English PGCE course at Leicester has a number of distinctive features. You will gain experience of writing poetry and composing a writing portfolio of a wide range of other texts in collaboration with others. You will take part in practical drama workshops and learn about teaching many aspects of Media and Film Studies. You will also engage in extra-curricular learning and have other opportunities to further your own professional development. \r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Interviews will be held with the Head of the Teaching School and either the Head Teacher of Southam College (the lead school for the teaching school alliance) or the Head Teacher or Deputy responsible for Teaching and Learning at either Bilton School (Rugby) or Kineton High School (Kineton).  The interview process may also involve a representative from the University of Leciester.
