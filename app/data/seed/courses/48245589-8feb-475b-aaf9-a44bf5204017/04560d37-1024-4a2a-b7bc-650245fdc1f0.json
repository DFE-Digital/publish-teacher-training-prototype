The PGCE course at the University of Leicester is divided into two halves, Phase A and Phase B, each with clearly delineated priorities to guide progress towards successful completion. \r\nTwo-thirds of the time (currently 24 weeks out of 36) is spent in schools, starting with a two week preliminary attachment to a Primary school with time spent in a Secondary school that its pupils transfer to.  You should consider this course if you have a passion for the subject and would like to contribute to young people's development by supporting them to acquire a knowledge base for life long skills in science/Biology. \r\n\r\nAt the University of Leicester there will be a set amount of PGCE assignments to complete across the course. Within our school, you will receive specialised support from a subject mentor and a professional mentor. You will have regular mentor meetings to review your progress and reflect on how your teaching is developing. We aim to produce teachers who are outstanding in their practice, self reflective and engage in action research to support their further development. At the University of Leicester you will be taught by teams of highly experienced practitioners who have a national reputation for the quality of their training.","interviewProcess":"Interviews will be held with the Head of the Teaching School and either the Head Teacher of Southam College (the lead school for the teaching school alliance) or the Head Teacher or Deputy responsible for Teaching and Learning at either Bilton School (Rugby) or Kineton High School (Kineton).

During this placement you will be expected to fulfil a 50% timetable.    \r\n\r\nPhase B \r\nDuring your second placement you will spend about 14 weeks in a different school, also supported by a mentor, ITE Coordinator and university tutor.  During this placement you will be expected to fulfil a 66% timetable.   \r\n\r\nAll students will also undertake a week in a primary school following their Phase A placement to support their understanding of the broader context of education and to support writing of one of the PGCE assignments.\r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for applicants who have a genuine passion for working with young people and supporting their development on both academic and personal levels.","otherRequirements":"","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:54:29.645Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-30T08:32:16.546Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2023"}
