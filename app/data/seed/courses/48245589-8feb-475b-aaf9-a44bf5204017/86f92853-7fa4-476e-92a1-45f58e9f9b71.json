The PGCE course at the University of Leicester is divided into two halves, Phase A and Phase B, each with clearly delineated priorities to guide progress towards successful completion. \r\nTwo-thirds of the time (currently 24 weeks out of 36) is spent in schools, starting with a two week preliminary attachment to a Primary school with time spent in a Secondary school that its pupils transfer to.  You should consider this course if you have a passion for the subject and would like to contribute to young people's development by supporting them to acquire a knowledge base for life long skills in Mathematics.\r\n\r\nMathematics is a core subject within the secondary curriculum.  Mathematics encompasses the study of number, algebra, ratio, proportion and rates of change, geometry and measures, probability and statistics.  At Leicester, we strive to ensure that you become an effective practitioner of Mathematics education with the ability to excite and engage pupils in all areas. \r\n\r\nYou will learn from some of the best practitioners in the field and, with their support, you will learn how to become an effective practitioner yourself. The programme will cover all areas of the National Curriculum for Mathematics, and will also address national testing, extra-curricular learning opportunities and your own professional development. \r\n\r\nThe Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) is offering Teacher Training Scholarships to Mathematics graduates who enter teacher training. There are also tax-free bursaries available. For more information, please visit the Get into Teaching website.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Interviews will be held with the Head of the Teaching School and either the Head Teacher of Southam College (the lead school for the teaching school alliance) or the Head Teacher or Deputy responsible for Teaching and Learning at either Bilton School (Rugby) or Kineton High School (Kineton).
