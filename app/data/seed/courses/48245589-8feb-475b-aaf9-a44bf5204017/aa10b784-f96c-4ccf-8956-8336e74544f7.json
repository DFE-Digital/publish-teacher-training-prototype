The PGCE course at the University of Leicester is divided into two halves, Phase A and Phase B, each with clearly delineated priorities to guide progress towards successful completion. \r\nTwo-thirds of the time (currently 24 weeks out of 36) is spent in schools, starting with a two week preliminary attachment to a Primary school with time spent in a Secondary school that its pupils transfer to.  You should consider this course if you have a passion for the subject and would like to contribute to young people's development by supporting them to acquire a knowledge base for life long skills in Geography. \r\n\r\nGeography is facing many challenges within the present education system. It is an exciting and relevant subject which plays a major role in helping children to develop a better understanding of the increasingly complex world around them.  Geography explores a wide range of contemporary world issues such as climate change, global geopolitics, migration and international development. There is something for everyone. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs a trainee teacher, you will have the opportunity to develop your personal and professional skills and expand your subject knowledge. The PGCE programme is both challenging and rewarding and we hope that it will develop both your enthusiasm and confidence as a geographer and a teacher. \r\n","interviewProcess":"Interviews will be held with the Head of the Teaching School and either the Head Teacher of Southam College (the lead school for the teaching school alliance) or the Head Teacher or Deputy responsible for Teaching and Learning at either Bilton School (Rugby) or Kineton High School (Kineton).  The interview process may also involve a representative from the University of Leciester. During  your day, you will also be asked to complete a numeracy and literacy focused task to assess the functional competencies required for a school setting.
