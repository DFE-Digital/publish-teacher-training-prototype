The content and the focus of the training programme will be targeted to meet your individual needs. You will also have the benefit of receiving training from Middlesex University and making use of their extensive resources, including the library and student support services. \r\n\r\nOur Apprenticeship programme also provides you with the opportunity to gain a postgraduate qualification (PGCert Teaching), which can be used towards a Masters award in the future. This will enable you to develop your skills for teaching and for understanding the interrelationship between learning and teaching, as you develop into a critically reflective practitioner.\r\n\r\nAll apprenticeship programmes have to be at least 12 months and this programme lasts for four terms.

Every day in school is different so you will need to be flexible and adaptable. We would like you to have had some experience of working with young people of primary age, but this does not need to be paid work. It could be helping with a sports team, drama group, youth group or voluntary work in schools. We welcome career changers and the skills that can be transferred between professions.
