ITTs spend 1 day a week at UEL (education and subject based lectures, teaching and tutorials) and 4 days a week in schools 'on the job' training. \r\nReading / study weeks are built into the calendar during half terms to accommodate trainees working towards the PGCE option. UEL days are typically front loaded in Term 1 to ensure trainees are up to date early in their training.\r\nSecond placement opportunities are calendared in Term 2 in blocks to ensure trainees are immersed into school life in their contrasting school placement - they do not attend UEL during this time. \r\nTerm 2 ends with a week at UEL - for tutorial opportunities with a focus on PGCE assignments and evidence gathering linked to the Teacher Standards. \r\nIn Term 3 trainee timetables increase in their 'home' school so UEL days are again reduced. Alternative education placement visits are organised by the Teaching School to ensure trainees have been exposed to a variety of educational settings including visits to Special Schools/ Units, Alternative Provisions and Independent Schools. \r\n\r\nAlongside the training at UEL, the BMAT ITT programme runs regularly to ensure trainees are up to date with everyday pedagogy,  MAT policies and procedures and subject networks. There is a layered system of support from the classroom to MAT level which ensures our trainees are supported and developed every step of the way. \r\n","interviewProcess":"We encourage prospective candidates to come meet us and tour our schools during the application process. \r\n\r\nPlease keep up to date about our Teacher Training Open Events on our website [bmat-trust.org](http://www.bmat-trust.org/577/teaching-school-2) and on Twitter @BMATTeach  \r\n\r\nYou will be formally invited to interview directly by the Teaching School Team at least 1 week in advance.\r\n\r\nThe interview process consists of three parts (approximately 1.5hour duration): \r\n* Basic Skills Assessment - a short test (20 minutes) to assess Literacy and Numeracy levels \r\n* Teaching a Lesson - you will be asked to plan and deliver a 30 minute lesson to a class of learners.
