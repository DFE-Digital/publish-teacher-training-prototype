These can be used to help pupils to become more self-confident, informed and culturally aware.\r\n\r\nThis course has strong links with local musical organisations such as Birmingham Music Service, the largest Music Service in the country. The course provides the opportunity to experience music education from a variety of perspectives, including organisations that form part of the Birmingham Hub for Music Education like Birmingham Contemporary Music Group (BCMG) and mac Birmingham.\r\n\r\nA key feature of the course is how we promote technology enhanced learning both in terms of developing beginning teachers and also how music technology can support teaching and learning in schools.\r\n\r\nYour course will feature a range of modules with support from colleagues in our Training School Alliance and experienced University tutors.
