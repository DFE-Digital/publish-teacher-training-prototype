We will train you to teach across the years, covering topics from learning how to introduce students to atoms, elements and particles, to thermodynamics and inorganic chemistry. \r\n\r\nYou will also learn how to demonstrate impressive chemical reactions safely!\r\n\r\nAs you progress, you will increase your ability to handle the ever-evolving teaching environment, and by the time your course is complete, you will be in a position to continue developing your understanding, knowledge and skills throughout your professional life.\r\n\r\nYour course will feature a range of modules and the opportunity to get plenty of hands-on practice in local schools with support from colleagues in our Teaching School Alliance and experienced University tutors.
