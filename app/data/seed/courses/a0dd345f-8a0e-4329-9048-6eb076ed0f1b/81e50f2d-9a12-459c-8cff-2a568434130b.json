We will train you to teach across the years, covering topics from learning how to introduce students to atoms, elements and particles, to thermodynamics and inorganic chemistry. \r\n\r\nYou will also learn how to demonstrate impressive chemical reactions safely!\r\n\r\nAs you progress, you will increase your ability to handle the ever-evolving teaching environment, and by the time your course is complete, you will be in a position to continue developing your understanding, knowledge and skills throughout your professional life.\r\n\r\nYour course will feature a range of modules and the opportunity to get plenty of hands-on practice in local schools with support from colleagues in our Training School Alliance and experienced University tutors. So while the School Direct PGCE is an academic qualification, the emphasis is very much on practical experience, with around two thirds of the course spent in school.\r\n\r\nTrainees will spend 4 days per week in school, with 1 day per week being a training day. These training days will be held at either the University or Bishop Challoner Catholic College.\r\n\r\nBishop Challoner Catholic College is the Lead School for the Central Midlands Science Learning Partnership, allowing schools to access the high quality materials and courses provided.\r\n","interviewProcess":"You will be required to attend one interview.
