The course is a practice-based programme that will fully support you into becoming a confident, dynamic and creative teacher committed to making history accessible for all.\r\n\r\nCentral to the curriculum is the study of history pedagogy and professional practice, which you will access through a synthesis of practical workshops, lectures, seminar groups and individual study.\r\n\r\nCurriculum workshops are a key element of your course. Dedicated, full-time history lecturers and teachers deliver these in our specialist education classrooms and lecture theatres. The workshops enable you to experience and develop your understanding of subject pedagogy through topics such as: History and British values, teaching controversial issues, teaching the Holocaust, using the National Archives as a teaching resource, learning outside of the classroom, use of artefacts inside the classroom, as well as Key Stage 3 National Curriculum topics, GCSE and A Level History topics.\r\n\r\nThis School Direct PGCE programme will feature a range of modules with support from colleagues in our Training School Alliance and experienced University tutors. \r\n\r\nTrainees will spend 4 days per week in school, with 1 day per week being a training day.
