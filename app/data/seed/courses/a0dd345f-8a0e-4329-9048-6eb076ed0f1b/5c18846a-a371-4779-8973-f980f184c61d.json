The course lays emphasis on language as a form of communication and on the value of language learning as a way of understanding other cultures and backgrounds.\r\n\r\nYou will develop a range of skills to enthuse youngsters and support them in achieving their linguistic potential, and learn about the importance of developing cultural understanding and the impact this can have in shaping young people’s worldviews. \r\n\r\nThe three most commonly taught languages in our Alliance Schools are French, German and Spanish. \r\n\r\nYour course will feature a range of modules with support from colleagues in our Training School Alliance and experienced University tutors. So while the School Direct PGCE is an academic qualification, the emphasis is very much on practical experience.\r\n\r\nTrainees will spend 4 days per week in school, with 1 day per week being a training day. These training days will be held at either the University or Bishop Challoner Catholic College.","interviewProcess":"You will be required to attend one interview.
