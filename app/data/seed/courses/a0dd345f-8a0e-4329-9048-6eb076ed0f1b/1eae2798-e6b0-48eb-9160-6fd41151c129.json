You will explore, test and develop the links between science and biology in education theory and its practice.\r\n\r\nThe workshops and seminars facilitate a space for learners to conduct this, which is then supported by school placements.\r\n\r\nThis relationship, between theory and practice, alongside two contrasting school experiences, ensures that you are offered a well-rounded teacher education. \r\n\r\nYour course will feature a range of modules with support from colleagues in our Training School Alliance and experienced University tutors. So while the School Direct PGCE is an academic qualification, the emphasis is very much on practical experience.\r\n\r\nTrainees will spend 4 days per week in school, with 1 day per week being a training day. These training days will be held at either the University or Bishop Challoner Catholic College.\r\n\r\nBishop Challoner Catholic College is the Lead School for the Central Midlands Science Learning Partnership, allowing schools to access the high quality materials and courses provided.\r\n","interviewProcess":"You will be required to attend one interview.

The second placement school will be discussed with you and your school mentor before any decisions are made.","personalQualities":"Personal qualities we are looking for include:\r\n\r\n* energetic\r\n* good communicator\r\n* able to inspire and enthuse\r\n* good organiser\r\n* imaginative and creative\r\n* confident and resilient.\r\n","otherRequirements":"Applicants must meet the Department for Educationâ€™s Initial Teacher Training criteria, which means being medically fit and successfully completing an enhanced disclosure via the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) and satisfying any other safeguarding checks required for this course.\r\n\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:54:54.783Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-03T22:10:04.017Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2023"}
