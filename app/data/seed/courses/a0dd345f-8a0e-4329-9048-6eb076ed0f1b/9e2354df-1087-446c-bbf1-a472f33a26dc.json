You will encourage pupils in their ability to problem solve using a variety of powerful modelling techniques. Your impact will be far-reaching, ensuring your pupils become creators of technology and not just consumers. You will help them develop transferable skills that can be used in a range of subject areas.\r\n\r\nThis course benefits from strong links with the British Computer Society (BCS) who are working with the Department for Education to develop the next generation of computing teachers through an organisation called\r\nComputing at School (CAS). The opportunities this partnership provides allows you to network with expert computing teachers throughout the West Midlands at regular hub meetings and access subject development opportunities.\r\n\r\nBishop Challoner Catholic College is the lead school for the Birmingham and Central Midlands Computing Hub, working in partnership with the National Centre for Computing Education (NCCE), in order to provide support for computing teachers in schools.\r\n\r\nYou will explore, test and develop the links between computing in education theory and its practice. The practical workshops in University facilitate a means for learners to conduct this, which is then supported by school placements.\r\n\r\nThis relationship, between theory and practice, alongside a variety of contrasting school experiences, ensures that you are offered a well-rounded teacher education. We believe that we are training computing teachers to work in any school setting. \r\n\r\nThis School Direct PGCE programme will feature a range of modules and the opportunity to get plenty of hands-on practice with support from colleagues in our Teaching School Alliance and experienced University tutors.\r\n\r\nTrainees will spend 4 days per week in school, with 1 day per week being a training day. These training days will be held at either the University or Bishop Challoner Catholic College.\r\n","interviewProcess":"You will be required to attend one interview.

The second placement school will be discussed with you and your school mentor before any decisions are made.\r\n","personalQualities":"Personal qualities we are looking for include:\r\n\r\n* energetic\r\n* good communicator\r\n* able to inspire and enthuse\r\n* good organiser\r\n* imaginative and creative\r\n* confident and resilient.\r\n","otherRequirements":"Applicants must meet the Department for Education’s Initial Teacher Training criteria, which means being medically fit and successfully completing an enhanced disclosure via the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) and satisfying any other safeguarding checks required for this course.","status":2,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:54:55.179Z","canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","cycle":"2024","salaryDetails":"Trainees on the salaried route will be paid on at least point 1 of the unqualified teacher scale, which in 2020/2021 is £18,169.\r\n\r\nYour school will pay the Birmingham City University tuition fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
