Please contact us to find out the latest list of schools with vacancies in particular subjects.\r\n\r\nIf more than one school wants to interview, the interview will be held at Bishop Challoner Catholic College and representatives from the interested schools will attend. When inviting applicants to interview they will be notified which schools will be represented on the interview panel.\r\n\r\nIf there is one school that wants to interview, the interview will be held at that school.\r\n\r\nIf the applicant is successful and several schools want to offer a place, the applicant can visit the schools and decide which school they prefer. This does not mean they have accepted a place at that school, it just means that they know that the Bishop Challoner offer is for that particular school.\r\n\r\nInterviews consist of:\r\n\r\n* a short teaching session\r\n* a written task\r\n* a formal interview.\r\n\r\nDetailed guidance will be provided about the interview process and what is expected when you are invited.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The main placement school for an applicant is discussed at interview, so that individual requirements can be taken into account.
