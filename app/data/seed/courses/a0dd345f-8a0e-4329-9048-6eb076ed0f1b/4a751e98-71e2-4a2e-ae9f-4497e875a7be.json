These training days will be held at either the University or Bishop Challoner Catholic College.\r\n\r\nBishop Challoner Catholic College is the Lead School for the Central Midlands Science Learning Partnership, allowing schools to access the high quality materials and courses provided. We also work closely with the Institute of Physics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"You will be required to attend one interview.
