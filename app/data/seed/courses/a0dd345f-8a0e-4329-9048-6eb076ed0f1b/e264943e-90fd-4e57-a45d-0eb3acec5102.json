Please contact us  to find out the latest list of schools with vacancies.\r\n\r\nIf more than one school wants to interview, the interview will probably be held at Bishop Challoner and representatives from the interested schools will attend. When inviting applicants to interview they will be notified which schools will be represented on the interview panel.\r\n\r\nIf there is one school that wants to interview, the interview will be held at that school.\r\n\r\nIf the applicant is successful and several schools want to offer a place, the applicant can visit the schools and decide which school they prefer. This does not mean they have accepted a place at that school, it just means that they know that the Bishop Challoner is for that particular school.\r\n\r\nInterviews consist of:\r\n\r\n* a short teaching session\r\n* a written task\r\n* a formal interview\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The main placement school for an applicant is discussed at interview, so that individual requirements can be taken into account. With most of our schools being located in or near the Birmingham area, travel time is not usually a problem.\r\n\r\nSuccessful applicants will always know which school will be their main placement when they are offered the place.\r\n\r\nThe second school placement takes place in the Spring Term, and this will always be discussed with the trainee and their school mentor before any decisions are made.\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"* energetic\r\n* good communicator\r\n* able to inspire and enthuse\r\n* good organiser\r\n* imaginative and creative\r\n* confident and resilient","otherRequirements":"Applicants must meet the Department for Education’s Initial Teacher Training criteria, which means being medically fit and successfully completing an enhanced disclosure via the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) and satisfying any other safeguarding checks required for this course.\r\n\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:54:53.531Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-04T06:46:46.782Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2023"}
