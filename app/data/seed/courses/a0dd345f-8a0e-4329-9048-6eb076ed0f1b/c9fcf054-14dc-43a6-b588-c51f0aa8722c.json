Please contact us to find out the latest list of schools with vacancies in particular subjects.\r\n\r\nIf more than one school wants to interview, the interview will be held at Bishop Challoner Catholic College and representatives from the interested schools will attend. When inviting applicants to interview they will be notified which schools will be represented on the interview panel.\r\n\r\nIf there is one school that wants to interview, the interview will be held at that school.\r\n\r\nIf the applicant is successful and several schools want to offer a place, the applicant can visit the schools and decide which school they prefer. This does not mean they have accepted a place at that school, it just means that they know that the Bishop Challoner offer on UCAS is for that particular school.\r\n\r\nInterviews consist of:\r\n\r\n* a short teaching session delivered to a small group of students - applicants will be informed at least 5 days before the interview about the topic, the age group/ability and the number of students\r\n* a formal interview.\r\n\r\nDetailed guidance will be provided about the interview process and what is expected when you are invited.\r\n\r\nPlease note: initially interviews will take place online this academic year.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The main placement school for an applicant is discussed at interview, so that individual requirements can be taken into account. With most of our schools being located in or near the Birmingham area, travel time is not usually a problem.\r\n\r\nSuccessful applicants will know which school will be their main placement when they are offered the place.\r\n\r\nThe second school placement takes place in the first half of the Spring Term, and this will be discussed with the trainee and their school mentor before any decisions are made.\r\n\r\nTrainees are also required to spend one week (or equivalent) in a primary school.\r\n\r\nThis School Direct programme  covers the 11-16 age group, with trainees also having the opportunity to observe and teach Sixth Form students.","personalQualities":"* energetic\r\n* good communicator\r\n* able to inspire and enthuse\r\n* good organiser\r\n* imaginative and creative\r\n* confident and resilient","otherRequirements":"A minimum of 3 years career experience, not necessarily in the education sector. However consideration will be given to applicants with slightly less career experience that show a strong commitment to teaching and have successfully worked in an educational environment eg as a teaching assistant or cover supervisor. \r\n\r\nApplicants must meet the Department for Education’s Initial Teacher Training criteria, which means being medically fit, successfully completing an enhanced disclosure via the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) and satisfying any other safeguarding checks required for this course.\r\n","status":2,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:54:53.664Z","canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","cycle":"2024","salaryDetails":"Trainees on the salaried route will be paid on at least point 1 of the unqualified teacher scale, which in 2020/2021 is £18,169.\r\n\r\nYour school will pay the University of Warwick tuition fees.\r\n\r\nThere will also be a tuition fee for the Masters Module of £2,000.
