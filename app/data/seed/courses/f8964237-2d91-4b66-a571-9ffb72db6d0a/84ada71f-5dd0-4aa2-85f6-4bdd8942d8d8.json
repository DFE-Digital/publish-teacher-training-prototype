Typical entry roles include a Teaching Assistant or Cover Supervisor.\r\n\r\nThe Postgraduate Teaching Apprenticeship blends workplace learning with part-time university study. You will be based in one of our secondary academies for the duration of the year long apprenticeship, and  80 per cent of your time will be spent engaging in on-the-job school-based training. The remaining 20 per cent will be spent studying through a mix of web-based, face-to-face and independent learning, covering:\r\n\r\n* Subject Knowledge Inputs\r\n* Professional Practice Development\r\n* Contemporary Issues In Education\r\n* Evidence Based Practice\r\n* Professional Knowledge Enquiry\r\n\r\nThe Primary Postgraduate Teaching Apprenticeship programme is offered in all of the Trust's infant and primary academies.\r\n\r\nIn your academy you’ll have a mentor who will meet with you every week to look at where you’re making progress and to set personalised targets for your development.\r\n\r\nYou will receive a thorough induction programme which includes shadowing pupils in order to give you the best preparation for you to begin your teaching journey. Following your induction you will work alongside teachers, often team teaching, in order to get to know your pupils and the subject matter well enough to then take over the classes fully.\r\n\r\nBy training with the University of Brighton Academies Trust you’ll also benefit from networking opportunities with trainees based at our other academies, and when your training is complete our continuing professional development (CPD) programme will help you to enhance your skills as your teaching career develops.

We may be able to provide you with this opportunity before you decide to apply; alternatively, the Get Into Teaching School Experience Programme offers opportunities across the country to book a day’s worth of experience.","otherRequirements":"All offers of places are subject to a satisfactory health check and a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) enhanced check.
