Over the year you will also spend time in another academy within the Trust. We believe this will help you to develop as a teacher, by broadening your experience of how different academies work.\r\n\r\nThe programme is offered in all three of our secondary academies:\r\n\r\n* The Hastings Academy has a formidable reputation for high standards and innovation, delivered by a team of talented professional staff.

Following your induction you will work alongside teachers, often team teaching, in order to get to know your pupils and the subject matter well enough to then take over the classes fully.\r\n\r\nBy training with the University of Brighton Academies Trust you’ll also benefit from networking opportunities with trainees based at our other academies, and when your training is complete our continuing professional development (CPD) programme will help you to enhance your skills as your teaching career develops.

This will include a pre-planned teaching activity, together with an interview with a member of the academy’s Leadership Team and the appropriate Subject Leader. ","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Candidates can indicate their preferred academy and this will be met where possible. Your host academy will be confirmed before the programme starts, so that you can arrange accommodation in advance. \r\n\r\nYou will be teaching students aged 11 to 16. \r\n\r\nThe majority of your school placement will be in your host academy. In February you’ll join another academy for 4-6 weeks, then continue at your host academy for the remainder of the year. \r\n\r\nYou will normally attend university based sessions for two days a week; the rest of the time is spent on school placement. ","personalQualities":"You will need a realistic awareness of the teaching profession with the capacity to thrive in a demanding and fast moving environment. \r\n\r\nWhile experience in a school is not a condition of entry for initial teacher education courses we recommend that you take up opportunities to gain a realistic understanding of whether teaching is right for you.  We may be able to provide you with this opportunity before you decide to apply; alternatively, the Get Into Teaching School Experience Programme offers opportunities across the country to book a day’s worth of experience.","otherRequirements":"All offers of places are subject to a satisfactory health check and a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) enhanced check.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:54:25.384Z","updatedAt":"2021-08-18T13:10:34.404Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2023"}
