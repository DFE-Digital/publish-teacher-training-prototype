Our course is designed to provide you with the knowledge, understanding and skills that you need to be an outstanding teacher.\r\n\r\nWhile we may be one of the oldest higher education institutions in the UK, we’re also a modern and innovative institution, with a well-deserved reputation for the quality of our education. The Faculty of Education and Children’s Services has been awarded 'Outstanding' status by Ofsted, credited with delivering \"high levels of academic and pastoral care\" - Ofsted Report 2016.\r\n\r\nWe offer two routes: the Core (University-led) Route, and the School Direct Route.\r\n\r\nThe Core (University-led) Route is a one-year, full-time course that leads to a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE Secondary). Successful completion also results in the completion of three M level modules which may be used towards a Master's degree.\r\n\r\nFor the School Direct Route, we work with a number of leading partnership schools to educate teachers. The professional aims of our School Direct courses are to produce high-quality teachers who are committed to learning, and are open-minded, creative and reflective in their practice. The course comprises two main elements:\r\n\r\n* 60 professional learning days\r\n* 120 (minimum) school-based learning days\r\n\r\nThe intention of School Direct is for leading schools to recruit and educate candidates in subject and age phases most in need of employment and choose how the Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programme should be delivered in partnership with the University.\r\n\r\nThe University of Chester Partnership has a rich history of developing highly skilled, knowledgeable teachers, and has a high employability rate. Our Partnership has learning at its heart, combined with passion and enthusiasm for teaching and learning. We will provide you with the support you need to become a critically reflective evidence-based practitioner.\r\n\r\nProfessional and academic learning takes place within University and partnership settings in lectures, seminars, practical workshops and tutorials, and is assessed through assignments and directed activities.\r\n\r\nSchool-based learning will move you from observation through group work to whole class teaching, and is assessed holistically against the Teachers’ Standards.\r\n\r\nYou will be expected to undertake 10 independent preparation and consolidation study hours (minimum) per week for the University course, in addition to full teaching days when on placement.","interviewProcess":"During the PGCE interview process, the course tutors will be looking for a wide range of qualities that would make you a good teacher.

In preparation for your interview, you may wish to develop your understanding of current educational issues as well as those relating specifically to your subject area. On the day we will be looking for your enthusiasm for teaching young people and your ability to reflect on your experiences of education. \r\n\r\nThe interview process will be used to determine your suitability for teaching and includes \r\n•\tan introduction to the course, \r\n•\tidentity checks,\r\n•\ta short presentation of a teaching task relating to your subject, \r\n•\ta subject knowledge activity,\r\n•\tan individual interview.\r\n\r\nYou may also be asked to complete a group activity if applicable to your subject.  \r\n\r\nAll candidates will be sent further information about what will be expected prior to the interview date. \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We have approximately 500 schools that we partner with. The schools you will be teaching in are selected on the basis of their ability to offer:\r\n\r\n* good support to trainee teachers; and\r\n* an Ofsted report that shows 'Good' teaching is in place.\r\n\r\nThe age range you will be teaching will be 11 to 18 years old.\r\n\r\nYou will have a minimum of two mainstream placements, as well as additional enrichment placements.\r\n\r\nYour travel from home to your school will take no more (and usually less) than 1 hour 15 minutes.","personalQualities":"","otherRequirements":"","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:51:06.604Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-15T09:34:27.002Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
