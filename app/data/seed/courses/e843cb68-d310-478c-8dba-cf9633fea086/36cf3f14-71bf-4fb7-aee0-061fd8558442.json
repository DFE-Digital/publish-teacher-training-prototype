Our course is designed to provide you with the knowledge, understanding and skills that you need to be an outstanding teacher.\r\n\r\nWhile we may be one of the oldest higher education institutions in the UK, we’re also a modern and innovative institution, with a well-deserved reputation for the quality of our education. The Faculty of Education and Children’s Services has been awarded 'Outstanding' status by Ofsted, credited with delivering \"high levels of academic and pastoral care\" - Ofsted Report 2016.\r\n\r\nWe offer two routes: the Core (University-led) Route, and the School Direct Route.\r\n\r\nThe Core (University-led) Route is a one-year, full-time course that leads to a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE Secondary). Successful completion also results in the completion of three M level modules which may be used towards a Master's degree.\r\n\r\nFor the School Direct Route, we work with a number of leading partnership schools to educate teachers. The professional aims of our School Direct courses are to produce high-quality teachers who are committed to learning, and are open-minded, creative and reflective in their practice. The course comprises two main elements:\r\n\r\n* 60 professional learning days\r\n* 120 (minimum) school-based learning days\r\n\r\nThe intention of School Direct is for leading schools to recruit and educate candidates in subject and age phases most in need of employment and choose how the Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programme should be delivered in partnership with the University.\r\n\r\nDuring the Design and Technology course (Core and School Direct routes), you will learn how to encourage young people’s understanding of design and technology through your subject specialism. The course is designed to ensure you are confident in all basic national curriculum requirements.\r\n\r\nProfessional and academic learning takes place within University and partnership settings in lectures, seminars, practical workshops and tutorials, and is assessed through assignments and directed activities.\r\n\r\nSchool-based learning will move you from observation through group work to whole class teaching, and is assessed holistically against the Teachers’ Standards.\r\n\r\nYou will be expected to undertake 10 independent preparation and consolidation study hours (minimum) per week for the University course, in addition to full teaching days when on placement.","interviewProcess":"During the PGCE interview process, the course tutors will be looking for a wide range of qualities that would make you a good teacher.
