The course is made up of General Professional Studies sessions, the Subject Specialism Programme and PGCE modules. It will also involve 2 teaching placements; the first runs from the beginning of October until the middle of December. The second placement runs from the middle of January until June. There will also be an Enhancement Programme before the first placement which has been put together to give trainees a range of experiences. By completing the visits, the trainees will gain a better understanding of a range of educational settings.\r\n\r\nAll trainees must demonstrate that they can fully meet each of the Standards for Qualified Teacher Status by the end of the course. Trainees will be continually assessed through lesson observations and placement reports whilst on teaching placements, and through a series of 3 short assignments. Detailed portfolios of evidence are submitted 3 times during the year to demonstrate how trainees are meeting the Standards for Qualified Teacher Status. Following the first 2 submissions, trainees receive feedback on their progress.\r\n\r\nThe PGCE is accredited by University of Sunderland and assessed through 2 written assignments. The 2 PGCE training modules will be held at The Work Place in Newton Aycliffe.\r\n\r\nIf a trainee does not meet the Standards for Qualified Teacher Status, but has passed the 2 PGCE modules, the credits can still be used towards a MA programme.\r\n","interviewProcess":"The first thing we look at is your application form and your references to decide whether or not we should invite you for interview. It is, therefore, important to include all the relevant information on the form to help us make this decision.\r\n\r\nIf you are invited to interview and have a disability, please let the Course Administrator know in advance if there are any special arrangements that should be made for the interview process, for example large print copies of documentation, additional time for reading or wheelchair access to the interview rooms.\r\n\r\nYou will be sent information about a 15 minute subject specific teaching task. The activity should be devised to be appropriate for a group of Year 10 (14 - 15) students. The interview panel will then ask you several questions to establish your motivation for wanting to teach in your chosen subject area and some administration questions. There will also be an opportunity for you to ask questions about the course. During the interview process there will be a literacy and numeracy activity to complete. \r\n\r\nThe formal interview panel will be made up of a subject specialist and one of the SCITT Directors. \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Placement schools are selected not only based in relation to a trainee's home location, but also on our judgments of how a trainee would fit into their subject department within each school. \r\n\r\nDurham SCITT have 46 partnership secondary schools and we try and ensure that trainees experience both 11-16 and 11-18 settings. Trainees will undertake 2 substantial placements in 2 of our partner schools. Placement A starts in October through to December and Placement B is January to June.\r\n","personalQualities":null,"otherRequirements":"Health Check\r\nBefore being accepted onto the course, all trainee teachers must satisfy the DfE requirements with regards to fitness to teach.
