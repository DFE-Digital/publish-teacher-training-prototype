Our PGCE Primary programme with PE Specialism offers excellent academic and pastoral care for trainees, which is reflected in high programme completion rates and levels of students' achievement. An excellent and successful partnership has been established between St. Mary's University Institute of Education and a range of partner schools, to provide initial teacher education, leading to Qualified Teacher status (QTS) in the primary phase. The enthusiasm, expertise and professionalism of all  staff in support of these outcomes, including the development of students' capacity to reflect on and analyse their own practice, is widely recognised.\r\n\r\nOur course tutors are all skilful, qualified teachers themselves, with many years of successful teaching experience in the state sector and higher education.\r\n\r\nSuccessful completion of the Primary PGCE with PE Specialism programme will result in the award of a Post Graduate Certificate of Education  with 60 Masters Credits and Qualified Teacher Status.\r\n\r\nThe Primary PGCE with PE Specialism programme aims to extend students' subject knowledge, skills and understanding, to enable them to develop as skilled and confident teachers of physical education in primary schools. The course demands engagement, commitment, participation and self-motivated study. \r\n\r\nYou will develop discrete subject knowledge, understanding and skills across the full range of core subjects, PE, RE and computing. Professional Studies underpin the pedagogy and practice of being a teacher, including themes of managing behaviour for learning, SEND and  lesson planning for progression.\r\n\r\nModules for Masters support your development across all areas. \r\n\r\nThe course runs over three school terms from the start of September to the end of June, with University based sessions five days a week and school -centred learning in partnership placements. The typical day at University starts at 9am and finishes at 4pm or 6pm.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opportunity to study for the Catholic Certificate in Religious Studies (CCRS) is also available.\r\n\r\nWe have a very successful Newly Qualified Teacher (NQT) employment record after the course - many trainees gaining their first job and beginning their teaching career in one of the two partner schools in which they trained.\r\n\r\nAn optional additional 30 Masters credits can be undertaken through our summer school prior to starting your NQT year.\r\n\r\nOver 97% of Primary PGCE with PE Specialism trainees had secured employment for September 2018!\r\n\r\nCome & meet us! https://www.stmarys.ac.uk/open-events/upcoming.aspx\r\n","interviewProcess":"Once we are confident you have met the course entry requirements, we carefully examine your personal statement. This is your opportunity to convince us that you have seriously thought through your journey into teaching in terms of motivation and a genuine understanding of what being a teacher really means. You will almost certainly find it helpful to refer to prior learning and classroom observation experiences and reflect on what you saw, heard or experienced. It is also your opportunity to connect your prior academic and/or work experiences to the skills and attitudes required for teaching. We want to clearly hear from you some thoughtful consideration of why you believe you will make a great teacher. Do this successfully and we will invite you for interview.\r\n\r\nAt the  interview, we want to get to know you and for you to get to know us and the PGCE Primary course at St. Mary's University.\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviews will be online for 2021 programmes.\r\n\r\nPrior to your interview, you will have the opportunity to hear a presentation from the Programme Director  explaining the structure of the course, school placements, the Enhancement Development placement, Masters Modules and assessments. You will also have the opportunity to have a virtual tour of the campus and view the excellent facilities that St. Mary's University offers its students and trainee teachers.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to meeting you and supporting you to become an Outstanding teacher for primary school children. \r\n\r\nCome & meet us at a monthly online Open Events! \r\nhttps://www.stmarys.ac.uk/open-events/upcoming.aspx\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will complete  assessed school placements during the PGCE Primary with PE Specialism programme. School placements are arranged by the Institute of Education Partnership team and the schools selected are based on your home/residential address. \r\n\r\nDuring your placements, you will guided from working with small groups of pupils alongside a class teacher towards taking responsibility for whole class teaching.\r\n\r\nAn experienced teacher acts as mentor during the school placement and contributes to your overall assessment as a new teacher.\r\n\r\nAt St Mary's University, we have the strongest commitment to student teacher support, regularly visiting student teachers in school  over the duration of the course. We see tutors retaining contact with student teachers while they are school-based, away from University as a major factor in our support success. The consistent support available for students is, we think, outstanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrainee teachers enrolled on the PGCE PE Specialism will receive a specific PE audit to address the needs of the PE module. As the course progresses, the number of PE lessons will increase to extend and challenge your PE subject knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we offer our PGCE Primary PE Specialism trainees an  \"Enhancement Development Placement\" - our trainees choose and arrange this classroom placement. It can far away or \"just around the corner\" - you get to choose! You will be able to focus on the targets identified at the end of your first assessed placement and develop the  skills and knowledge to meet them with confidence.\r\n\r\nSt. Mary's University is in partnership with over 700 schools - many of our trainees go on to become NQT's in these partner schools.","personalQualities":"During the interview and selection process, you will take part in  an ONLINE interview and discussion  that will allow you to evidence that you have thought carefully about your motives for becoming a teacher and can demonstrate that you have some emerging capability to reflect on what being a teacher means.
