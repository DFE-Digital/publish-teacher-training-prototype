The present understanding is that 'Home and Irish' students have access to the 'Home' fee. Some EU citizens with a permanent right to remain in the UK may also have access to 'Home' fees.\r\n\r\nFor further details - please check the government website for teacher training funding.

The university runs 'Getting into Teaching' open events every month, where you can often chat with the subject tutor. Book a place via https://www.stmarys.ac.uk/open-events/pgce.aspx\r\n\r\nSome course details are below and further information is available via https://www.stmarys.ac.uk/postgraduate-courses-london/pgce-secondary-re/\r\n\r\nThe secondary PGCE RE course is dedicated to producing excellent RE teachers who can teach in schools with or without a religious character.\r\n\r\nThe PGCE course aims for you to think deeply about the theory of teaching RE as well as develop the practical skills to be successful in the classroom.\r\n\r\nThose with a good honours first degree, majoring in Religious Studies or Theology, will normally be considered. \r\n\r\nOther degrees may be considered but with a likely condition that a subject knowledge enhancement course is undertaken.  \r\n\r\nIt is preferable to have sufficient accredited knowledge of two or more of the major world faiths in order to be able to teach the subject to GCSE level. \r\n\r\nEarly application is therefore recommended conveying a vision of what teaching RE can be like in 21st century England.\r\n\r\nOur training qualifies you to teach RE in all secondary schools, and applications are welcome from candidates with appropriate subject knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe employment statistics for our RE students is extremely high, many in our partnership schools where the head of department and all of the RE department are previous St Mary's RE students.\r\n\r\nIn general terms and throughout the course, your progress is monitored and supported by both University and Partnership school staff who have developed successful working relationships with previous cohorts.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Once we are confident you have met the course entry requirements, we carefully examine your personal statement. This is your opportunity to convince us that you have seriously thought through your journey into teaching in terms of motivation and a genuine understanding of what being a teacher really means.\r\n \r\nYou will almost certainly find it helpful to refer to any prior learning and classroom experiences and reflect on the implication of what you saw, heard or experienced.\r\n\r\nWithin your statement, it is often helpful to connect your prior academic and/or work experiences to the skills and attitudes required for teaching.\r\n\r\nYour interview will be conducted on-line. We will want to get to know you a little better and for you to get to know us. The process is likely to include\r\n\r\n - you give a short presentation (details will arrive with your invite to interview)\r\n\r\n - an assessment of your subject knowledge\r\n\r\n - an assessment of your competency in English\r\n\r\nIn advance of your interview you will be sent links to short informative videos that explain the structure and other key factors of the programme.\r\n\r\nIn making an application to St. Mary’s, applicants provide their consent for the interview to be recorded.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to meeting you and supporting you to become an outstanding teacher of children.\r\n\r\nSt Mary's is graded 'Outstanding' by OFSTED","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"St. Mary's University is in partnership with over 150 schools - many of our trainees go on to become NQT's in these partner schools.\r\n\r\nYou will gain experience in TWO different school settings through the course. You will be school-based for a minimum of 120 days.\r\n**** These government expectations are temporarily suspended ****\r\n\r\nWe take into account your personal accommodation postcode when looking at placements. Students with declared disabilities will have these taken into account when allocating school placements.\r\n\r\nAcross your training you will have experience of working in Key Stage 3 and 4. There is usually the opportunity to experience post 16.\r\n\r\nAn experienced teacher acts as mentor during the school placement and contributes to your overall assessment as a new teacher.\r\n\r\nWe have the strongest commitment to student teacher support, regularly visiting student teachers in school over the duration of the course to quality assure the placements.\r\n\r\nWe see tutors retaining contact with student teachers while they are school-based, away from University as a major factor in our support success. The consistent support available for students has been recognised by Ofsted in 2011 and again in 2019 as outstanding.","personalQualities":"During the interview and selection process, you will have a number of opportunities for you to evidence that you have thought carefully about your motives for becoming a teacher and can demonstrate that you have some emerging capability to reflect on what being a teacher means.\r\n\r\nWe are looking for candidates who can demonstrate a genuine passion for teaching, working with and supporting children and an understanding of the resilience needed for teaching.","otherRequirements":"School observation - Ideally, we would like all applicants to have made a fully informed decision about considering joining the teaching profession. As part of that decision making process, spending some time in school(s) observing what teachers do and beginning to give some consideration to how they manage learning, can be really insightful and informative.\r\n\r\nDBS check - Successful completion of a physical and mental fitness to teach and a Satisfactory Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check are also required for teacher training.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-12T13:49:07.342Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-06T11:59:18.534Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
