We are looking for applicants who can embrace creativity and innovation in their teaching whilst also seeking to meet the diverse needs of a range of children.   \r\n\r\nTeaching English is a wonderful profession where you are able to facilitate the development of a range of communication skills and the course will support you to develop literacy in all children, foster a passion for reading and facilitate critical analysis. You should be receptive to learning via collaborative working as much emphasis in your training on experiential learning and sharing of good practice. \r\n\r\nThe course is planned and delivered by course tutors with a strong teaching and academic background.  Additional sessions are also delivered by specialist practitioners.  \r\n\r\nThe course prepares you to teach English at key stages 3 and 4 in contrasting schools, with opportunities for you to explore provision at key stage 5 and key stage 2. The university tutor and link tutors work closely with you and your mentor whilst you are on school placement offering a dual model of support. \r\n\r\nAssessment is completed through formative and summative assignments in university, and through an assessment profile on school placement which measures your progression against the Teachers’ Standards. In addition you will complete a portfolio of evidence to exemplify your best practice and which complements the assessment profile. \r\n\r\nWe have an online 8 week Subject Knowledge Enhancement course for applicants who need to deepen their own understanding of English before starting on the PGCE course. We would advise you to apply early if you might be in this position. \r\n\r\nIn general terms and throughout the course, your progress is monitored and supported by both University and Partnership school staff who have developed successful working relationships with previous cohorts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Once we are confident you have met the course entry requirements, we carefully examine your personal statement.

We will want to get to know you a little better and for you to get to know us. The process is likely to include\r\n\r\n - you give a short presentation (details will arrive with your invite to interview)\r\n\r\n - an assessment of your subject knowledge\r\n\r\n - an assessment of your competency in English\r\n\r\n In advance of you interview you will be sent links to short informative videos that explain the structure and other key factors of the programme.\r\n\r\nIn making an application to St. Mary’s, applicants provide their consent for the interview to be recorded.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to meeting you and supporting you to become an outstanding teacher of children.\r\n\r\nSt Mary's is graded 'Outstanding' by OFSTED","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"St. Mary's University is in partnership with over 150 schools - many of our trainees go on to become NQT's in these partner schools.\r\n\r\nYou will gain experience in TWO different school settings through the course.

The consistent support available for students has been recognised by Ofsted in 2011 and again in 2019 as outstanding.","personalQualities":"During the interview and selection process, you will have a number of opportunities for you to evidence that you have thought carefully about your motives for becoming a teacher and can demonstrate that you have some emerging capability to reflect on what being a teacher means.\r\n\r\nWe are looking for candidates who can demonstrate a genuine passion for teaching, working with and supporting children and an understanding of the resilience needed for teaching.\r\n","otherRequirements":"School observation - Ideally, we would like all applicants to have made a fully informed decision about considering joining the teaching profession.
