For secondary courses this is split into two phases approximately 16 weeks and 11 weeks long. \r\n\r\nYou will spend time in two contrasting schools to ensure you gain varied and valuable experiences. We have partnerships with over 600 schools and colleges in the South East offering opportunities in large, small, urban and rural settings. \r\n\r\nSchool-based training is organised on your behalf by our Partnership Office. At the start of your course you will complete a placement information form which will help us match you with suitable school settings. We will take into account your previous experience, the distance from your home and any individual needs such as caring responsibilities. We aim to minimise your travelling time to placement and wherever possible keep it under 40 minutes. \r\n\r\nOur staff will ensure that you are well prepared for each phase of school-based training, and that you have all the support and guidance you need to make the most of these opportunities. We run bespoke sessions to guide you through the expectations of school-based training and provide thorough guidance in handbooks.\r\n\r\nTrainees consistently evaluate their school-based training highly and Ofsted identify our approach to training in schools as a key strength of our courses, with an excellent balance between university tuition and school-based training.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about school-based training on [our website.](https://www.brighton.ac.uk/current-students/my-studies/placements/training-to-teach.aspx) \r\n","personalQualities":"","otherRequirements":"All firm offer holders will be required to complete a satisfactory Suitability Declaration, DBS and Overseas Police check plus Occupational Health Questionnaire.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:55:55.999Z","updatedAt":"2021-08-26T12:36:12.946Z","cycle":"2023","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
