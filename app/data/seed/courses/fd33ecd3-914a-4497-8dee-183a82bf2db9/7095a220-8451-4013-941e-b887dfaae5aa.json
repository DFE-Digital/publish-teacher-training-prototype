Training is front-loaded to the Autumn term, which means more time in school during the Summer term, to prepare you for being a fully-fledged NQT. Whilst in school, you will observe successful teachers; teach children in small groups up to whole classes; plan and deliver learning to children (with coaching and mentoring from your expert School Based Trainer) and join in with school-led training opportunities.\r\n\r\nWe assess your skills as teachers by judging your impact on the outcomes for the children you are teaching. You will present information for assessment in written formats, portfolios, presentations and tutorial discussions. All assessments are continuous throughout the year through individual tasks and group projects.\r\n\r\nCore Training takes place through our accredited provider, Two Mile Ash ITT at their dedicated training centre and provides inspirational, hands-on training from safeguarding to subject knowledge; behaviour management to building resilience; time management to stress management, and much more.  Training days provide an opportunity for the cohort to share experiences, while learning from our expert trainers. These sessions provide you with ‘headspace’ and an opportunity to reflect on teaching as well as learning new skills and pedagogies to take back to school.\r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Our interview process has been adapted currently to ensure safe practice and will initially be conducted online. When invited to interview, full details will be shared at that point, about the adaptations that we have made.\r\n\r\nPlease don’t worry about the interviews – we want to working with you to understand your motivations for teaching and are looking to see if you have the potential to train to teach – you don’t already have to be able to teach! The teaching activity evidences how you engage and interact with children and this gives us an idea of your potential to train. Things can sometimes go wrong with interview or the teaching activity with the children, again don’t worry, because you will be given an opportunity to reflect on things that you would do differently another time.\r\n\r\nRemember, learning to teach is a journey and you can be really successful from whatever starting point you have, whether you are a Teaching Assistant who has been in school for many years or someone with very little classroom experience. Our interview process is designed to explore that with you.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"All our Partnership schools are selected on the basis of their effectiveness and expertise. The Partnership thrives because of the active role that schools take in the design and delivery of the programme and because of their commitment to training teachers in their schools.\r\n\r\n You will be immersed in the school from the outset, meaning that you 'live and breathe' real-life teaching and become a valued member of the school team. You will spend most of the year in your ‘home school’, with a 6 week placement in an alternative school and alternative key stage, as well as a short time in a special school and/or a nursery school. Your School-Based Trainer will mentor you during the year, which means your programme is bespoke to you, resulting in you being the best teacher you can be!\r\n","personalQualities":"MKITT as the accredited provider, and its partners are looking for ambitious trainee teachers who are passionate and enthusiastic about working with students.  The programme is challenging, and so we are looking for candidates with a wide range of skills, knowledge, experiences and an aptitude for teaching\r\n\r\nAs a minimum, the provider would like candidates to have completed some classroom observation or have some experience of working with students in a teaching/leading role before making an application but this is not compulsory.  Candidates should be aware of contemporary issues in education.\r\n","otherRequirements":"* Declaration of any convictions declared on your UCAS application\r\n* An Enhanced DBS Disclosure will be required follow an offer of a place\r\n* A satisfactory health questionnaire will be required follow an offer of a place\r\n* Satisfactory clearance for registration\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:47:34.411Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-28T08:53:16.407Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2024","applicationsOpenDateOther":"2021-11-29T00:00:00.000Z"}
