Each is based on developing each trainee with a bespoke plan and experience designed to make you the best teacher you can be. All programmes are an 11-16 programme with a post 16 enhancement.  \r\nPhysical education trainees will teach both examination and core PE classes as part of their placements.\r\nYou will be placed in two schools for your assessed placement from across our partnership schools. The normal pattern of the year is to be in your placement school for four days per week and to attend our training programme one day per week. We have very experienced mentors who are there to guide and support trainees throughout their training year and you will have the opportunity to visit a variety of schools on training days to broaden your experience and understanding. We provide all our trainees with their own laptop during the programme and have a dedicated website for trainee support and resources. All trainees are registered with the University of Huddersfield for a  PGCE. We are looking for candidates with normally either a degree in their subject or related to it, or for candidates with a non-related degree an A level in the subject at C or above.","interviewProcess":"\r\nSelections take place throughout the year.  They include an interview with a selected panel of staff and a short activity designed for a group of pupils. These will take place in person where possible and online where not.  \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Our programme places you in two schools from within the partnership across the year and you will work across two key stages; key stage 3 (11-14) and 4 (14-16) with post-16 enhancement. Our Secondary partners are based in Halifax, Huddersfield, Bradford & Leeds. Partnering with local schools in the area, we feel fully encompasses the geographical, social and economic diversity of West Yorkshire, offering our alliance breadth and depth. A key strength of our partnership is the diversity of schools; your two placement schools will be contrasting and the range of children and teachers you will work with will come from across the entire alliance ensuring you are trained to teach in all schools from the very start of your career.","personalQualities":"We are first and foremost looking for potential!  This is a training programme so we do not expect you to be the finished article but we are looking for people who are committed to teaching as a career, who are highly motivated, reflective and creative.  \r\nA passion for your subject and good communication skills are important to demonstrate in both your application form and the interview process.\r\nWe can support candidates with school experience prior to application or  beginning the programme.","otherRequirements":"* It would be helpful to have spent time in school to ensure you have an understanding of the role of the teacher.   To support candidates who lack school experience we would recommend: reading some articles about teachers and schools in the weekly newspaper Schools' Week, downloading the NationalCurriculum Orders and watching some online Oak Academy lessons.\r\n\r\n* You will also need to undertake an enhanced DBS check and an occupational health check","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:49:24.132Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-28T09:30:52.188Z","cycle":"2023","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"}
