You will also spend nine weeks in an additional Primary School, focussing on a different phase to experience the full range of the primary curriculum. Trainees can choose if they wish to train specifically in either Primary or Special Schools, or to complete a combination of the two.\r\n\r\nThe course usually starts with your main placement on the first two inset day in August so the trainee feels part of the school from the outset.\r\n\r\nOne day each week your training will be split between FWA Hub sessions, held at a local venue and time spent at the University of Derby. This training will focus on all aspects of teaching pedagogy, including lesson planning and evaluation, behaviour management, literacy and functional skills, learning theory, diversity and inclusion, equality, safeguarding and creative engagement. A carefully devised programme of training has been developed between the University and FWA which enables a very wide breadth of skills, knowledge and strategies to be taught across the two establishments.\r\n\r\nContinuous feedback is offered throughout the course and there are no examination papers set by the University. At regular points throughout the course mentors judge the trainees guided by the CCF and a final summative assessment against the Teacher Standards takes place at the end of the course. Regular visits from a Link Tutor feed into these judgements. At any point in the year support is available from the programme manager at FWA and from the University if a trainee requires it.\r\n\r\nSuccessful completion of the course leads to the award of PGCE and 60 credits at Masters level awarded by the University of Derby and Qualified Teacher Status.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Interviews will usually take place at a local Primary School and dates will be set as required throughout the year.\r\n\r\nThe interviews will comprise of:\r\n\r\n* Group discussion on selected topics and current educational issues\r\n* Individual interview\r\n* Completion of a Literacy and Numeracy test (subject to change)\r\n* Visit to class to meet pupils and teachers (where possible)\r\n \r\nThe interview panel will be a selection of:\r\n\r\n* FWA School Direct Programme Manager\r\n* FWA Lead Practitioner\r\n* Senior teacher from an Alliance school\r\n\r\nWe may have to undertake interviews on-line in the event of government Covid restrictions.\r\n\r\nYou will need to bring the following with you to the interview:\r\n\r\n* Photo ID (Passport/Driving Licence)\r\n* Original Degree Certificate (if available)\r\n* Original GCSE Certificates for English, maths and science ","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Your placements will be at  Primary Schools within Forest Way Alliance, all placements are arranged by FWA, you will not be expected to find your own placement.\r\n\r\nTrainees will have the opportunity to work in a variety of schools with additional visits to other schools.
