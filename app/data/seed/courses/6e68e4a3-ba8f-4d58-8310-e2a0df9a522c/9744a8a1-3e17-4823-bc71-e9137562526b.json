These placements will be in contrasting schools within FWA to give you a broad range of experience.\r\n\r\nAlthough your placement will be at an Alliance school, you will share most, if not all, the Secondary PGCE Professional Studies Course with the Secondary PGCE students on the 'core' (University-led) PGCE course, giving you a great opportunity to share experience and practice with other students. Your subject studies will be undertaken together with core PGCE students.\r\n\r\nThis training will focus on all aspects of teaching pedagogy, including lesson planning and evaluation, behaviour management, literacy and functional skills, learning theory, diversity and inclusion, equality, safeguarding, creative engagement, PSHE and form tutoring.\r\n\r\nIn school, your subject teaching will be closely monitored and supported by a mentor in the department. Senior members of staff hold overall responsibility in each school for the training of trainee teachers, including tutorials and the provision of opportunities for professional development and whole school concerns.\r\n\r\nSuccessful completion of the course leads to PGCE and 90 credits at Masters level awarded by the University of Leicester and Qualified Teacher Status.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis course differs from our other Biology course on offer with the University of Derby in that training for this course will be solely provided by the University of Leicester.
