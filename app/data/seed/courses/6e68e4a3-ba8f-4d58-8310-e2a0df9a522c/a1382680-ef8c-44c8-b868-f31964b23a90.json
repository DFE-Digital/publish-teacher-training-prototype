Senior members of staff hold overall responsibility in each school for the training of trainee teachers, including tutorials and the provision of opportunities for professional development and whole school concerns.\r\n\r\nSuccessful completion of the course leads to the award of PGCE and 90 credits at Masters level awarded by Loughborough University and Qualified Teacher Status.\r\n\r\nThis course differs from our other Mathematics courses on offer with the Universities of Derby and Leicester in that training for this course will be solely provided by Loughborough University and no time will be spent training with FWA Hub, although placement schools are the same.
