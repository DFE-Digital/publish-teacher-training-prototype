We are committed to providing the highest quality professional learning for teaching apprentices, supporting them to have the biggest impact in the classroom and providing an excellent foundation for a successful career in education.\r\n\r\nArk Teacher Training gives you a firm foundation in how to teach Modern Foreign Languages (specifically French and Spanish). Over the year you will have regular sessions focused on not just how to be a great teacher, but also how to be a great teacher of languages. \r\n\r\nOver the training course, you will cover the best ways to teach languages, based on research. This will include the development of key skills and strategies central to language learning, giving our students an excellent foundation in listening, reading, writing and speaking and, most importantly, we will get them using different languages confidently and effectively.","interviewProcess":"Once you've checked that you're [eligible](https://www.arkteachertraining.org/apply-now/eligibility-criteria/), you can either submit your application directly through the UCAS or Apply portals, or use our own ‘Apply Now’ form, which is available on our website. \r\n\r\n* We will assess your application and let you know whether or not you meet our [selection criteria](https://www.arkteachertraining.org/characteristics-and-qualities/). \r\n* Applicants who meet our criteria will be sent two online tests to complete: a situational judgement assessment and a subject knowledge test. You can have a look at the format of the situational judgement test on our website, [here](https://www.arkteachertraining.org/apply-now/how-to-apply/)\r\n\r\n* If your application is shortlisted, you'll be invited to our first stage of assessment with a recruiter: a video interview and pre-prepared presentation. \r\n\r\n* Successful applicants will then proceed to the final, school-led assessment. Due to Covid-19, this will be a video call with an interview panel consisting of a senior leadership team member or Principal of one of our partner schools, as well as members of our programme delivery and recruitment teams. You'll 'teach' a short lesson and be asked to respond to feedback, as well as answer some questions to help us further determine your readiness to train to teach. \r\n\r\nIf you're successful, we'll match you with the school in our network that best fits your profile, and you'll be offered a place there.\r\n\r\nIf you applied through our website originally, we'll ask you to complete your UCAS form at this stage so we can finalise our decision through the formal portal.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Your training school - in London, Birmingham, Hastings or Portsmouth - will be matched to your particular profile as a candidate, while taking into account your commuting distance and funding/subject preferences (and availability on our programme, which changes as we move through the recruitment cycle). \r\n\r\nBecause of Covid-19 restrictions and pressures on schools regarding external visitors, you may not be able to visit your school before accepting an offer there. However, please be assured that schools are equally as keen to invite you to visit in person and will work with you to arrange this as soon as they can (most likely after your DBS check has been completed). \r\n\r\nThe apprenticeship itself is 100% school-based, but you will come out of school to spend a half day every week in a session with your Ark tutor and other trainees from the network as part of the apprenticeship's 20% off the job training.\r\n\r\nYou’ll also obtain experience in different schools throughout the year; you will have a three week placement in a different school to your own, and will also have the opportunity to visit other educational settings. Finally, at the end of the apprenticeship and at the beginning of your induction year, you will undertake an End Point Assessment.","personalQualities":"Our applicants have a huge variety of experience between them, all of which can be used in the classroom.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are some qualities we know all successful trainees have, regardless of their background or experience; we look for these at assessment: \r\n\r\n- Alignment with Ark’s values and ethos\r\n- Some experience with young people (doesn't have to be in a school)\r\n- Great communication skills\r\n- Resilience (teaching is hard!)\r\n- Curiosity and eagerness to learn\r\n- Self-awareness and keenness to hear/act on feedback (you'll receive a lot on our programme, every week!)","otherRequirements":"There's a great deal to think about when you make the decision to train as a teacher: it's an intensive year, but on Ark Teacher Training you'll be well-supported and have plenty of time with your fellow trainees for moral support every week. \r\n\r\nIf you have questions about areas not covered in this search tool so far, our website covers a lot of specific information on our programme. Check out our ['Frequently Asked Questions'](https://www.arkteachertraining.org/apply-now/application-faqs/) if you can't find what you're looking for!","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:51:34.687Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-27T13:52:56.492Z"}
