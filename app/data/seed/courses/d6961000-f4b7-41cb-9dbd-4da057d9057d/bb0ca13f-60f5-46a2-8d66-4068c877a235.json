During the course you will develop your knowledge of how pupils learn science, how to plan effective lessons and practicals; and how assessment can improve learning and teaching in science. You will develop as a reflective teacher who makes informed decisions about how to teach science with high professional standards.\r\n \r\nThe PGCE course consists of three modules designed to support the award of the PGCE and Qualified Teacher Status. \r\n\r\nModule 1 Professional Practice \r\nThis combines theory and practice in developing your subject knowledge and pedagogical skills and understanding. You will be immersed in professional studies sessions enabling you to develop holistically as a teacher. \r\n\r\nModule 2 Reflective Teacher (Masters level) \r\nThis module aims to develop your theoretical understanding of what it is to be a teacher as well as your practical skills as a reflective practitioner. This will help you to critically analyse your own teaching and grow as a teacher. \r\n\r\nModule 3 Policy, Practice and Professionalism (Masters level) \r\nThis module aims to develop your understanding of teaching as a research-informed profession and how policy and practice impact upon each other. \r\n\r\nThe PGCE course is organised in two strands: subject days and three blocks of school experience days. \r\n\r\nYou will spend subject study days at the university taught by leading practitioners in science who are effective, research-engaged teachers. They will help you to develop your knowledge of learning and teaching science through research-led innovative practice that will model new approaches to learning and teaching science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects. \r\n\r\nThe three blocks of school experience days, spread through autumn, spring and summer terms, will be spent in schools developing practical teaching skills with the support of experienced science mentors and teachers. \r\n\r\nWe work  in close collaboration with partner schools who help to deliver sessions and prepare students for interviews in schools. \r\n\r\n Assessment is based on practice in schools and by written assignments on our Level 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing successful completion of this course, you will receive a Postgraduate Certificate in Education leading to Qualified Teacher Status and gain 60 credits of postgraduate study. These credits can be imported into our  Masters of Research course taught at the university.  \r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"If you meet the initial criteria of the course, you will be invited to interview. Currently these are taking place remotely via Microsoft Teams.   Prior to your interview, you will be expected to complete a 5 minute video recording of a teaching segment and upload this 24 hours in advance of your interview. Further details will be provided in your interview invitation.\r\n\r\nThe online interview session can take up to 2 hours and will involve a formal interview with a subject tutor. During your interview, your awareness of current issues in secondary education; passion for teaching your subject and understanding of the National Curriculum will be explored. \r\n\r\nFollowing your interview, you will be expected to complete a timed subject task as well as an English written task.\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will spend a minimum of 120 days across two contrasting schools. The first placement builds confidence in teaching and planning lessons.\r\n\r\nThe second placement develops understanding and practice in assessing pupils work and the final placement consolidates knowledge, skills and understanding of pedagogy and will aim to make you increasingly independent and ready for your year as a Newly Qualified Teacher. \r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"We explore the following areas when selecting candidates: \r\n\r\n- Understanding of secondary school curriculum, including the identification of area for development before and during the course; \r\n- Depth of subject knowledge, including understandings of the nature and methods of the discipline; \r\n- Enthusiasm for their specialist subject; \r\n- Interest in teaching and motivation for seeking entry to the profession; \r\n- Experiences of working with young people and what has been learned from secondary school visits; \r\n- Knowledge and understanding of the aims and content of the National Curriculum and \r\n- Experience of using ICT with areas for development identified.
