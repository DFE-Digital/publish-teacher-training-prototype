In addition, trainees may opt in to gaining a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) with University of Cumbria. The course is full time over 38 weeks (term time only). Trainees will receive an immersive training programme where they are working alongside outstanding teachers with current and relevant experience.\r\n\r\nTrainees receive structured classroom observations, weekly professional studies sessions and a phased introduction to small group teaching, team teaching and then whole class teaching.\r\n\r\nTrainees will be assessed across the academic year against The Compton SCITT's  ITT Curriculum within a supportive and developmental model. Experienced subject mentors facilitate bespoke weekly targets to ensure all Teachers' Standards are met by the end of the course. \r\n\r\nThere are 5 reflection pieces set over the training year. These are research based learning tasks embedded in the realities of the modern classroom. Current academic research and reading underpin all professional studies sessions and assignments.\r\n\r\nThe Compton SCITT Partnership is committed to the wellbeing of trainee teachers. We are aware that an ITT year will be demanding and therefore have a variety of mechanisms in place including a designated pastoral lead. \"Somehow youâ€™ve struck a happy medium between the checkbox requirements of government legislation and the true humanity that underpins teaching.\" (English trainee teacher).\r\n","interviewProcess":"Applicants will be invited for interview on the basis of information provided on their application form. All SCITT Training Route trainees will be interviewed at The Compton School.\r\n\r\nThe interview will typically involve a half-day at the school. This will include a 20 minute lesson observation and a numeracy and literacy assessment. Candidates will be told in advance about the content of the lesson and the age range you will be teaching.\r\n\r\nCandidates will be observed teaching by a member of our senior staff and a subject specialist. If successful in the first part of the interview candidates will then be invited to the final panel interview including the Headteacher.\r\n\r\nThe interview process is rigorous and thorough, designed to get the best match of applicant to the places available.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The course is full time over 38 weeks (term time only).
