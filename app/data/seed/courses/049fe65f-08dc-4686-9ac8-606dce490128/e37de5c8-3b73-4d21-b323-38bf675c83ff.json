This qualification will not prevent you from working with older children in the future. \r\n\r\nSchool Experience\r\n \r\nYou will spend a minimum of 120 days in a school or early years setting. This will be divided into two blocked school experiences which will allow you to develop a broad understanding of the role of the teacher in contrasting settings.  You will spend one third of the programme in University. In this time you will have mix of lectures and small group seminars to support you in developing a strong and confident knowledge of the subjects you will be teaching in the primary classroom. Underpinning the programme is the Professional Studies course which is designed to prepare you fully for the wider roles and responsibilities of the teacher. \r\n\r\nThe Primary PGCE (QTS) Programme at Goldsmiths is taught and assessed at masters level. In addition to a recommendation for QTS, if you pass all academic elements of the programme, you will also leave with level 7 credits equivalent to one third of a masters degree. Full academic support is provided to ensure you are fully prepared for assessment regardless of your prior experiences. \r\n\r\nStudies and Professional Issues in Research in Education (SPIRE)\r\n  \r\nThe SPIRE module focuses specifically upon issues that most impact upon the young person’s experience of education in the 21st Century.  In sessions you will be asked to: consider a range of issues relating to diversity and inclusion; engage with research and policy and link all of this to your own experience in the classroom.  In your written assignment you will choose one area from this module to reflect upon more deeply. \r\n\r\nCurriculum Studies\r\n\r\nThis is a module designed for Early Years specialist students. We will explore the nature of young children's learning, become familiar with the statutory Foundation Stage guidance as well as approaches to planning and assessment. We will also explore the nature of young children's play, the role of adults in supporting and managing learning and the importance of working with parents and carers.   \r\n\r\nFurther information can be found here [PGCE Primary](https://www.gold.ac.uk/pgce/primary/)\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Interviews will take place at Goldsmiths with tutors from the university team and may also involve staff from our partnership schools. \r\n\r\nThe selection process has several components that are designed to ensure that you have the necessary skills, knowledge and understanding to begin the journey to becoming a teacher.
