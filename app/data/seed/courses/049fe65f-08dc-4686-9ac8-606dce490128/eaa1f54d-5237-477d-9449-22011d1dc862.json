These are: \r\n\r\n•\tSchool Experience  \r\n•\tStudies and Professional Issues in Research in Education \r\n•\tCurriculum Studies \r\n\r\nSchool Experience\r\n \r\nDuring the programme you will spend a minimum of 120 days in school. This will be divided into two blocked school experiences which will allow you to develop a broad understanding of the role of the teacher in contrasting settings.  You will spend one third of the programme in University. In this time you will have mix of lectures and small group seminars to support you in developing a strong and confident knowledge of the subjects you will be teaching in the primary classroom. Underpinning the programme is the Professional Studies course which is designed to prepare you fully for the wider roles and responsibilities of the teacher. \r\n\r\nThe Primary PGCE (QTS) Programme at Goldsmiths is taught and assessed at masters level. In addition to a recommendation for QTS, if you pass all academic elements of the programme, you will also leave with level 7 credits equivalent to one third of a masters degree. Full academic support is provided to ensure you are fully prepared for assessment regardless of your prior experiences. \r\n\r\nStudies and Professional Issues in Research in  Education (SPIRE)\r\n  \r\nThe first of the academic modules (SPIRE) focuses specifically upon issues that most impact upon the young person’s experience of education in the 21st Century.  In sessions you will be asked to: consider a range of issues relating to diversity and inclusion; engage with research and policy and link all of this to your own experience in the classroom.  In your written assignment you will choose one area from this module to reflect upon more deeply. \r\n\r\n Curriculum Studies\r\n  \r\nThe Curriculum Studies module will ask you to look more deeply at one chosen area. Currently the courses we offer are: \r\n\r\n*\tMaths in Action*; \r\n*\tChildren’s Literature;\r\n*     Modern Languages*\r\n*     Profound and Complex Needs. \r\n\r\n\r\n*You may also apply to these pathways directly through the following UCAS course codes.  \r\nPrimary with Mathematics with Goldsmiths  2M3G\r\nPrimary with Modern Languages at Goldsmiths 2M3K \r\n\r\nFurther information can be found here [PGCE Primary](https://www.gold.ac.uk/pgce/primary/)\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Interviews will take place at Goldsmiths with tutors from the university team and may also involve staff from our partnership schools. \r\n\r\nThe selection process has several components that are designed to ensure that you have the necessary skills, knowledge and understanding to begin the journey to becoming a teacher.  These components include:\r\n \r\n*\tSubject knowledge checks (Maths and Phonics);\r\n*\tA written English assessment; \r\n*\tGroup task;\r\n*\tIndividual interviews. \r\n\r\nWe are not looking for applicants to be the “finished article” at interview but rather our processes will ensure that you are ready to take on the challenges you might face on the PGCE (QTS) programme. \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The Primary PGCE Programme at Goldsmiths offers you the opportunity to specialise in one of two age phases. These are: \r\n\r\n*\t5-11 (with placement in Key Stages 1 and 2) \r\n*\t7-11 (with placements in Upper and Lower Key Stage 2). \r\n\r\nYou will be asked at interview to select the age phase you are most interested in working with. \r\n\r\nWe work with a partnership of over 300 schools across London and beyond. This means that during your time on the PGCE (QTS) programme you will have the opportunity to work in contrasting schools and settings which will provide breadth to your understanding of the role of the teacher. \r\n\r\nYou will have two extended placements during your programme during the Autumn and Summer terms. Placements are allocated for you once you have enrolled onto the programme. In placing you we take into account any care responsibilities or personal circumstances and we will locate a school for you that is within a reasonable travelling distance from your home in the light of this. \r\n\r\nGoldsmiths will also arrange enrichment experiences which are shorter focussed placements arranged to meet your specific needs. These might include short placements in:  Special Schools; Pupil Referral Units; Hospital Schools; Early Years Centres or schools in different locations across the UK.\r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for applicants that have an understanding of the nature of working in an urban setting and have a clear commitment and enthusiasm for working with children. \r\n\r\nYou must be able to show resilience and be willing to work with others.\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"You do not need to have extensive school experience before applying but we do ask that you spend a minimum of 5 days in a primary school prior to starting the programme to ensure that you are fully aware that the profession is right for you.\r\n\r\nYou will also need to fulfil our [Fitness to Train requirements](https://www.gold.ac.uk/fitness-to-train/)","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:02.466Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-15T14:53:04.520Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
