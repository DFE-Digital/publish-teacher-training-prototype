The curriculum includes working with resistant materials (product design), systems and control (electronics, CAD/CAM), textiles, and food technology. What unifies these is the subject of Design, and the development of designing competence. The Subject Studies Module is assessed in year 1. \r\n\r\nThe Studies and Professional Issues in Research in  Education (SPIRE) module focusses on issues that most impact upon the young person’s experience of education in the 21st Century. In sessions you will be asked to: consider a range of issues relating to diversity and inclusion; engage with research and policy and link all of this to your own experience in the classroom. In your written assignment you'll choose one area from this module to reflect upon more deeply. This module is assessed in year 2. \r\n\r\nYou'll spend a minimum of 120 days in school which will be divided into two block school experiences. These will allow you to develop a broad understanding of the role of the teacher in contrasting settings. You will also spend the equivalent of 8 weeks in University, with a mix of lectures and small group seminars which are designed to support you in developing a strong and confident knowledge of your subject area. This module is assessed across years 1 and 2. \r\n\r\nUnderpinning the programme is the Professional Studies course which prepares you for the wider roles and responsibilities of the teacher. This will be enhanced by ongoing training during school experience and will include aspects such as: behaviour management, working with pupils with English as an Additional Language and Special Educational Needs. Assessment of this module is through a portfolio of evidence and will require you to demonstrate your engagement across all eight of the Teachers’ Standards.\r\n\r\nThe programme is taught and assessed at masters Level. In addition to a recommendation for QTS, if you pass all academic elements, you'll also leave with 60 masters level credits, equivalent to one third of a masters degree. Full academic support is provided to ensure you are fully prepared for assessment regardless of your prior experiences. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor further details :[PGCE Design & Technology](https://www.gold.ac.uk/pgce/secondary-design-technology/)\r\n","interviewProcess":"Interviews take place either at Goldsmiths or in one of our partnership schools. \r\n\r\nInterviews will require you to demonstrate your own knowledge in the subject you are intending on teaching as well as including activities to gauge your understanding of the teaching profession. \r\n\r\nActivities at interview will include:\r\n \r\n*\tA written English test;\r\n*\tAn opportunity to demonstrate group work skills; \r\n*\tAn individual interview; \r\n*     You will be asked to bring a portfolio with a sample of your work to present at interview. \r\n\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The Secondary PGCE Programme at Goldsmiths offers you the opportunity to specialise in the 11-18 age range.\r\n\r\nWe work with a partnership of over 300 schools across London and beyond.
