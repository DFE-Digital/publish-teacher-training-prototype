London secondary schools need good Maths teachers. This exciting and demanding programme will prepare you to become an effective and high-quality Maths teacher, with a particular focus on the unique demands of working in a multi-ethnic London comprehensive school.\r\n\r\nIn Studies and Professional Issues in Research in Education (SPIRE)  sessions you will be asked to: consider a range of issues relating to diversity and inclusion; engage with research and policy and link all of this to your own experience in the classroom. In your written assignment you will choose one area from this module to reflect upon more deeply.\r\n\r\nYou'll spend a minimum of 120 days in school. This will be divided into two block school experiences allowing you to develop a broad understanding of the role of the teacher in contrasting settings. You will also spend the equivalent of 8 weeks in University, with a mix of lectures and small group seminars which are designed to support you in developing a strong and confident knowledge of your subject area.\r\n\r\nUnderpinning the programme is the Professional Studies course which prepares you for the wider roles and responsibilities of the teacher. This will be enhanced by ongoing training during school experience and will include aspects such as: behaviour management, working with pupils with English as an Additional Language and Special Educational Needs. Assessment of this module is through a portfolio of evidence and will require you to demonstrate your engagement across all eight of the Teachersâ€™ Standards.\r\n\r\nThe programme is taught and assessed at masters level. In addition to a recommendation for QTS, if you pass all academic elements of the programme, you will also leave with 60 masters level credits, equivalent to one third of a masters degree. Full academic support is provided to ensure you are fully prepared for assessment regardless of your prior experiences. \r\n\r\n[PGCE Mathematics](https://www.gold.ac.uk/pgce/secondary-mathematics/)\r\n","interviewProcess":"Interviews take place either at Goldsmiths or in one of our partnership schools. \r\n\r\nInterviews will require you to demonstrate your own knowledge in the subject you are intending on teaching as well as including activities to gauge your understanding of the teaching profession. \r\n\r\nActivities at interview will include:\r\n \r\n*\tA written English test;\r\n*\tAn opportunity to demonstrate group work skills; \r\n*\tAn individual interview; \r\n*     In Maths interviews you are asked to prepare a presentation demonstrating your interest and passion for Maths;\r\n\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The Secondary PGCE Programme at Goldsmiths offers you the opportunity to specialise in the 11-18 age range.\r\n\r\nWe work with a partnership of over 300 schools across London and beyond. This means that during your time on the PGCE (QTS) programme you will have the opportunity to work in contrasting schools and settings which will provide breadth to your understanding of the role of the teacher. \r\n\r\nYou will have two extended placements during your programme during the Autumn and Spring/ Summer terms. \r\n\r\nPlacements are allocated for you once you have enrolled onto the programme. In placing you we take into account any care responsibilities or personal circumstances and we will locate a school for you that is within a reasonable travelling distance from your home in the light of this. \r\n","personalQualities":"In addition to a strong subject knowledge, we are looking for applicants that have an understanding of the nature of working in an urban setting and have a clear commitment and enthusiasm for working with young people. \r\n\r\nYou must be able to show resilience and be willing to work with others.","otherRequirements":"\r\nYou do not need to have extensive school experience before applying but we will expect you to have a clear understanding of some of the realities you will face in the classroom. \r\n\r\nYou will also need to fulfil our [Fitness to Train requirements](https://www.gold.ac.uk/fitness-to-train/)","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:02.196Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-15T14:50:42.832Z","cycle":"2023","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
