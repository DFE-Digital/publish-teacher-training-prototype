It offers you a route into teaching a subject that is dynamic and constantly changing. Our experts will teach you, through a diverse and integrated course, everything you need to know about the place of Media Studies within the school curriculum.\r\n\r\nYou will spend  approximately 75% of the programme focussing upon Media Studies and the remainder focussing upon English at Key Stage 3.   Much of the teaching takes place in the [English & Media Centre](https://www.englishandmedia.co.uk/) \r\n\r\nThe Studies and Professional Issues in Research in Education (SPIRE) module is focussed upon issues that most impact upon the young person’s experience of education in the 21st Century. In sessions you will be asked to: consider a range of issues relating to diversity and inclusion; engage with research and policy and link all of this to your own experience in the classroom. \r\n\r\nYou'll spend a minimum of 120 days in school which are divided into two blocks allowing you to develop a broad understanding of the role of the teacher in contrasting settings. You'll also spend the equivalent of 8 weeks in University, with a mix of lectures and small group seminars designed to support you in developing a strong and confident knowledge of your subject area.\r\n\r\nUnderpinning the School Experience Module  is Professional Studies  which prepares you for the wider roles and responsibilities of the teacher. This will be enhanced by ongoing training during school experience and will include aspects such as: behaviour management, working with pupils with English as an Additional Language and Special Educational Needs. Assessment of this module is through a portfolio of evidence and will require you to demonstrate your engagement across all eight of the Teachers’ Standards.\r\n\r\nThe programme at Goldsmiths is taught and assessed at masters Level. In addition to a recommendation for QTS, if you pass all academic elements of the programme, you will also leave with 60 masters level credits, equivalent to one third of a masters degree. Full academic support is provided to ensure you are fully prepared for assessment regardless of your prior experiences. \r\n\r\n\r\n[PGCE Media Studies with English](https://www.gold.ac.uk/pgce/secondary-media-studies-english/)\r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Interviews will require you to demonstrate your own knowledge in the subject you are intending on teaching as well as including activities to gauge your understanding of the teaching profession. \r\n\r\nActivities at interview will include:\r\n \r\n*\tA written English test;\r\n*\tAn opportunity to demonstrate group work skills; \r\n*\tAn individual interview; \r\n*     You will complete a specific task that connects to the Teaching of Media. \r\n\r\nAll interviews will take place in the [English & Media Centre](https://www.englishandmedia.co.uk/) \r\n\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The Secondary PGCE Programme at Goldsmiths offers you the opportunity to specialise in the 11-18 age range.\r\n\r\nWe work with a partnership of over 300 schools across London and beyond.
