You will expected to specialise in two languages.* \r\n\r\n*See the Requirements Section below for further details.  \r\n\r\nWe seek to encourage an interactive teaching approach that builds confidence, develops understanding of how the language system works and leads to purposeful language use. You will be working with young people from a wide range of backgrounds, aptitudes and needs. This is challenging as well as exciting, so we offer a gradual and supportive introduction to the classroom.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Studies and Professional Issues in Research in Education (SPIRE) module asks you to reflect upon areas that most impact upon the young person’s experience of education in the 21st Century. In this module you will be asked to: consider a range of issues relating to diversity and inclusion; engage with research and policy and link all of this to your own experience in the classroom. \r\n\r\nYou'll spend a minimum of 120 days in school which will be divided into two block school experiences allowing you to develop a broad understanding of the role of the teacher in contrasting settings. In this time you will be expected to teach your two focus languages. \r\n\r\nUnderpinning the programme is the Professional Studies course which prepares you for the wider roles and responsibilities of the teacher. This will be enhanced by on-going training during school experience and will include aspects such as: behaviour management, working with pupils with English as an Additional Language and Special Educational Needs. Assessment of this module is through a portfolio of evidence and will require you to demonstrate your engagement across all eight of the Teachers’ Standards.\r\n\r\nThe programme is taught and assessed at masters level. In addition to a recommendation for QTS, if you pass all academic elements, you will also leave with 60 masters level credits, equivalent to one third of a masters degree. Full academic support is provided to ensure you are fully prepared for assessment regardless of your prior experiences. \r\n\r\n[Further details can be found here](https://www.gold.ac.uk/pgce/secondary-mfl/)\r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Interviews take place  at Goldsmiths \r\n\r\nInterviews will require you to demonstrate your own knowledge in the subject you are intending on teaching as well as including activities to gauge your understanding of the teaching profession. \r\n\r\nActivities at interview will include:\r\n \r\n*\tA written English test;\r\n*\tAn opportunity to demonstrate group work skills; \r\n*\tAn individual interview; \r\n*     You will need to prepare a short teaching episode to demonstrate   how you might engage pupils in learning language. \r\n*     You may also be asked to complete a written and verbal task in both languages you  will choose to specialise in.\r\n\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The Secondary PGCE Programme at Goldsmiths offers you the opportunity to specialise in the 11-18 age range.\r\n\r\nWe work with a partnership of over 300 schools across London and beyond.
