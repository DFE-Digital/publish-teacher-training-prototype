These are: \r\n\r\n•\tSchool Experience  \r\n•\tStudies and Professional Issues in Research in Education (SPIRE)  \r\n•\tCurriculum Studies; Modern Language \r\n\r\n\r\nSchool Experience\r\n \r\nDuring the programme you will spend a minimum of 120 days in school.  In your school experience,  you will not only be teaching Modern Languages but will be excepted to plan and teach across the curriculum. \r\n\r\nYour school experience will be divided into two blocked experiences which will allow you to develop a broad understanding of the wider role of the teacher in contrasting settings.  \r\n\r\nYou will spend one third of the programme in University. In this time you will have mix of lectures and small group seminars to support you in developing a strong and confident knowledge of all of the subjects you will be teaching in the primary classroom. Underpinning the programme is the Professional Studies course which is designed to prepare you fully for the wider roles and responsibilities of the teacher. \r\n\r\nThe Primary PGCE (QTS) Programme at Goldsmiths is taught and assessed at masters Level. In addition to a recommendation for QTS, if you pass all academic elements of the programme, you will also leave with level 7 credits equivalent to one third of a masters degree. Full academic support is provided to ensure you are fully prepared for assessment regardless of your prior experiences. \r\n\r\nStudies and Professional Issues in Research in  Education (SPIRE):  \r\nThe SPIRE module  focuses specifically upon issues that most impact upon the young person’s experience of education in the 21st Century.  In sessions you will be asked to: consider a range of issues relating to diversity and inclusion; engage with research and policy and link all of this to your own experience in the classroom.  In your written assignment you will choose one area from this module to reflect upon more deeply. \r\n\r\nCurriculum Studies: \r\n In this course you will follow an innovative structure combining three strands that will help you develop the knowledge, skills and understanding you need in teaching and learning modern foreign languages at primary level. You will be engaged in practical and theoretical enquiry, both at Goldsmiths and on school placement, to enable you to reach your full potential. \r\n\r\n\r\nFurther information can be found here [PGCE Primary Modern Languages](https://www.gold.ac.uk/pgce/primary-modern/)\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Interviews will take place at Goldsmiths with tutors from the university team and may also involve staff from our partnership schools. \r\n\r\nThe selection process has several components that are designed to ensure that you have the necessary skills, knowledge and understanding to begin the journey to becoming a teacher.  These components include:\r\n \r\n*\tSubject knowledge checks (Maths and Phonics);\r\n*\tA written English assessment; \r\n*\tGroup task;\r\n*\tIndividual interviews. \r\n\r\nWe are not looking for applicants to be the “finished article” at interview but rather our processes will ensure that you are ready to take on the challenges you might face on the PGCE (QTS) programme. \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The Primary PGCE Programme at Goldsmiths offers you the opportunity to specialise in one of two age phases.

This means that during your time on the PGCE (QTS) programme you will have the opportunity to work in contrasting schools and settings which will provide breadth to your understanding of the role of the teacher. \r\n\r\nYou will have two extended placements during your programme during the Autumn and Summer terms. Placements are allocated for you once you have enrolled onto the programme. In placing you we take into account any care responsibilities or personal circumstances and we will locate a school for you that is within a reasonable travelling distance from your home in the light of this. \r\n\r\nGoldsmiths will also arrange enrichment experiences which are shorter focussed placements arranged to meet your specific needs.
