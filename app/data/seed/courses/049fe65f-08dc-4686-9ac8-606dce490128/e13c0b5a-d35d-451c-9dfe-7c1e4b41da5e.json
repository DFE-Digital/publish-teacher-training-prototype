In SPIRE sessions you will be asked to consider a range of issues relating to diversity and inclusion, engage with research and policy and link all of this to your own experience in the classroom.   \r\n\r\nIn the Curriculum Studies module, as a Modern Language Specialist, you will consider language curriculum design, working with parents to support language learning, bilingualism, how to teach languages in conjunction with other curricular areas and how to help students transition their language learning from primary to secondary school. \r\n\r\nAll student teachers will spend a minimum of 120 days in a school,  divided into two block school experiences.  During your placement, you will have an opportunity to practice and apply the knowledge and skills that we have addressed during university sessions in the age phase/s you have chosen to focus upon. As part of at least one of your School Experiences, with the support of expert colleagues, you will have the opportunity to plan, resource, teach and assess French, German or Spanish. \r\n\r\nYou will spend one-third of the programme at University. In this time you will have a mix of lectures and small group seminars to support you in developing a strong and confident knowledge of all of the subjects you will be teaching in the primary classroom. Underpinning the programme is the Professional Studies course which is designed to prepare you fully for the wider roles and responsibilities of the teacher. \r\n\r\nThe programme is taught and assessed at master's level. In addition to the award of QTS, if you pass all academic elements of the programme at an appropriate level, you will graduate with 60 master's level credits which are equivalent to one-third of a master's degree. Full academic support is provided to ensure you are fully prepared for assessment regardless of your prior experiences.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther information can be found here [PGCE Primary Modern Languages](https://www.gold.ac.uk/pgce/primary-modern/)\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Interviews will take place at Goldsmiths with tutors from the university team and may also involve staff from our partnership schools. \r\n\r\nThe selection process has several components that are designed to ensure that you have the necessary skills, knowledge and understanding to begin the journey to becoming a teacher.
