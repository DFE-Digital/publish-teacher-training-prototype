","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The University of Roehampton Schools Partnership encompasses a range of different types of school across London and the surrounding counties. These include:  local authority schools, academies, free schools and faith schools. The schools we work with also reflect the culturally and ethnically diverse community surrounding the University. Student Teachers benefit enormously from such varied school experiences and it is a key strength of our Partnership. We ensure that Student Teachers are offered two contrasting assessed placements (called Block School Experience 1 and 2), which meet the requirements of the age range for which their course is accredited. \r\n\r\nStudents spend a minimum of 120 days in school during the programme. Placements are driven first and foremost by the student teachersâ€™ identified learning needs in a rich curriculum to prepare them as primary school teachers. In our 2021 exit survey, 95% of students who had finished the course rated their placement experiences highly. \r\n","personalQualities":"We look for candidates who have good interpersonal skills and a strong desire to teach. Teachers need to be flexible and prepared to take on a wide range of responsibilities. It is not a requirement to have spent time in school before the course starts but many candidates find this very useful in preparing them for the realities of classroom life.","otherRequirements":"UK enhanced DBS check is required prior to enrolment and a suitability declaration will be requested when accepting a place.
