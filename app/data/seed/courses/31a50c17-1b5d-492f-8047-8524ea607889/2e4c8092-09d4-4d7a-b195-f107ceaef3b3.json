This maybe with a school with whom you are already employed in a similar or different role. \r\n\r\nThe entry requirements for PGTA programmes are exactly the same as all graduate teacher-training routes, but the PGTA is specifically suited to those who already have strong experience working with children in the age range for which they wish to teach.  \r\n\r\nAs part of your programme, you will receive:\r\n80% in the classroom gaining practical experience and skills supported by your school-based mentor. This will involve subject knowledge, lesson observation, team teaching, solo-teaching and learning support \r\n20% of your course time will be spent off-the-job training back at college. This is largely provided by following the same PD programme as our school-direct trainees at College but can include other training based at your school.\r\n\r\nAfter successfully gaining QTS, you will be put forward to complete your End Point Assessment (EPA), in agreement with your employer. The EPA involves a formal observation and professional discussion conducted by an external assessor. This final assessment shows successful completion of your apprenticeship.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this is not an advertisement for a vacancy. ","interviewProcess":"We are looking for people who can show that they are resilient and committed to both working with young people and joining the teaching profession. We are particularly interested in talking to people who have a proven track record in working with young learners.\r\n\r\nInterviews will either take place at your employing school or at City College Norwich within Covid19 guidelines. You will be fully briefed on the format. If we are unable to do face-to-face interviews they will be held online. You will be asked to carry out a 10-minute activity and then answer formal questions to enable us to judge that you are suited to the course.  The process usually takes an hour. \r\n\r\nIf we haven't previously worked with your employing school, we will also hold a Partnership meeting to brief them on the commitments and responsibilities for supporting you through this course. \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Individuals applying for this route will have already secured employment with a school who will support you through the majority of your training.\r\n\r\nNTTC works closely with the individual and their employing school to secure a complimentary placement with another school within our partnership. This complimentary placement takes place for half a term at a suitable point in the course. This placement will be in a consecutive key stage to your age group which you are based in with your employer. ","personalQualities":"Most importantly, you will be able to demonstrate why you want to work with young children and prove your commitment to the primary sector.","otherRequirements":"Most candidates will be able to demonstrate experience working with young people. However, we evaluate each application on a person-by-person basis and we are keen to take all your experience in to account. We will check your application against the Children’s Barred list and require a full DBS check from the school you are working in. \r\n\r\nFor all Primary Teaching Apprenticeships, you will need to have an employer, or come to an agreement with a school who is prepared to employ you from the start of the course.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:46:37.406Z","updatedAt":"2021-08-24T14:31:26.378Z","canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","cycle":"2024"}
