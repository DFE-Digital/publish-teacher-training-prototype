Firstly, we will support you in developing the skills you need to become an effective classroom teacher of Computing and ICT. Secondly, we will offer you the opportunity to prepare for early career advancement. Thirdly, we will help you to develop your skills in e-learning and the wider use of educational technologies, which are becoming central to the teacher's role. \r\nThis course will explore the emerging curriculum for Computing and ICT and how the subject is developing in schools. You will have an opportunity to teach in two schools and experience a range of courses such as GCSE Computing, GCSE ICT and you will also undertake work around A Level ICT and Computing courses. \r\nIn your placement schools or colleges, your responsibilities will be equivalent to those of a serving teacher, but on a reduced timetable. The working day starts at approximately 8.30am and ends at 5.00pm. Sometimes it is shorter, but you will need to plan your life to reflect the demands of the school day and the school term dates, which may not be the same as the published IOE/UCL term dates. \r\nDays spent at the IOE/UCL include keynote lectures, subject lectures, seminars, workshops, tutorials and directed study days. In addition, time in the evenings and at weekends is needed for further study and planning. We aim to provide a forward-looking programme which combines teaching experience with practical workshops based at the IOE/UCL. You will address issues such as classroom management, lesson planning, assessment and the development and use of e-learning tools, alongside a range of more general professional issues. \r\nYou will be assessed in two ways: on your practical teaching and your progress in achieving the Teachers' Standards at a level consistent with what could reasonably be expected of a student teacher: on assignments, portfolio tasks and, for some subjects, practical projects. We will monitor your progress throughout the PGCE and you will record this in a Career Entry and Development Profile Statement. This will form part of a portfolio that links into the induction year (your first year of teaching) and your continuing professional development. https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/courses/teacher-training/computing-ict-pgce\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Applicants who are shortlisted are invited to a  Wandle TSA selection day. Candidates should allow a full day for this and dress appropriately. Candidates will be asked to complete a set of tasks; this will include a written task, an oral presentation , student based task and an  interview with school subject specialists. \r\nIf successful, candidates will be recommended to the IOE/UCL for an interview by the IOE/UCL subject specialist team. Candidates should allow a full day for this and dress appropriately. If successful at this stage, the IOE/UCL will make a conditional offer. Applicants will have 10 days to accept or reject the offer. \r\n Candidates will have to be certified as meeting the national requirements for physical and mental fitness to teach. The IOE/UCL will ask candidates to complete a health questionnaire for scrutiny by their occupational health provider. Candidates are responsible for the cost of obtaining occupational health clearance, which is approximately £45. Candidates will also be required to apply for an Enhanced Disclosure certificate from the DBS as a condition of entry. \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Wandle TSA PGCE School Direct students will have two school placements. These will be in two of our partner schools and will offer you a contrasting school experience, for example, one placement in a mixed school and a second in a single sex school.  We will discuss with you the best school to have your placements taking into account your travel requirements. All our School Direct students are invited to spend the first week of term with their first placement school as an early induction and to gain invaluable experience in participating in the beginning of term. This also allows many of the induction processes to be carried out and for you to get to know staff, systems and students. The age range will be from 11 to 18 and you will be required to teach across two stages in your placement, Key Stage 3 and 4 or 5 when you join us for your formal placements and training.\r\nWe have seven  secondary partner schools in our alliance. These schools are situated in SW London, primarily in Wandsworth and Lambeth and all schools have excellent transport links.\r\nThe length of school placement is 120 days over the two placements In addition to the class teachers you will have a subject mentor, a  school mentor as well as your IOE/UCL mentor to support you through these placements. You will always be supported in your classroom teaching and all our schools have extensive in house  training programmes. The Alliance runs several extra workshops throughout the training .\r\nWe have  special schools , primary schools  and Children centres in our Alliance and we encourage our students to take advantage by visiting to gain a wide understanding of the educational landscape.\r\nAt all times we keep you at the centre of the learning process and we work hard to ensure you have a challenging but supportive experience. ","personalQualities":"The Wandle Teaching School Alliance wishes to recruit high quality graduates committed to developing themselves as outstanding teachers. We are looking for candidates who have high expectations for their students. You should be a good communicator, enjoy challenge and have a love of learning. You will need to be resilient, flexible and hard working. We expect you to have excellent subject knowledge and the ability to build a strong rapport with students of all abilities. It also helps to have a sense of humour and, most importantly of all, to like and respect children. ","otherRequirements":"We strongly recommend that you spend some time observing teaching and learning in an inner London school before applying or whilst waiting for interview. \r\nThis is important as teaching and learning is a dynamic process and changes in pedagogy and curriculum content may mean classrooms are   very different places from when you last were in school. It is therefore important  to spend some time in a school so as you can reflect on what you have learned in your PGCE interviews.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:53:53.920Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-23T10:38:23.373Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2024"}
