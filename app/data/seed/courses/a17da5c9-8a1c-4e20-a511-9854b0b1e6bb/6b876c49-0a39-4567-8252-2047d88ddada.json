Wandle TSA and  UCL work in partnership with around  30 primary schools to enable Primary PGCE students to fully prepare to be a primary teacher. We encourage a wide range of students to study for the Primary PGCE, and have a good record of attracting traditionally under-represented groups.\r\nYou will have a Wandle TSA school based mentor as well as an UCL/IOE mentor to support you throughout the course\r\n\r\nhttps://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/courses/teacher-training/primary-pgce\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Applicants who are shortlisted are invited to a  Wandle TSA selection day. Candidates should allow a full day for this and dress appropriately. Candidates will be asked to complete a set of tasks; this will include  literacy and numeracy tasks, an oral presentation , student based task and an  interview with Wandle TSA staff..  \r\nIf successful, candidates will be recommended to the IOE/UCL for an interview by the IOE/UCL primary specialist team. Candidates should allow a full day for this and dress appropriately. If successful at this stage, the IOE/UCL will make a conditional offer. Applicants will have 10 days to accept or reject the offer. \r\n Candidates will also have to be certified as meeting the national requirements for physical and mental fitness to teach. The IOE/UCL will ask candidates to complete a health questionnaire for scrutiny by their occupational health provider. Candidates are responsible for the cost of obtaining occupational health clearance, which is approximately £45. Candidates will also be required to apply for an Enhanced Disclosure certificate from the DBS as a condition of entry. \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Wandle TSA PGCE School Direct students will have two school placements. These will be in two of our partner schools . We will discuss with you the best school to have your placements taking into account your travel requirements. All our School Direct students are invited to spend the first week of term with their first placement school as an early induction and to gain invaluable experience in participating in the beginning of term. This also allows many of the induction processes to be carried out and for you to get to know staff, systems and students. We work with over 30 primary partner schools which are situated in SW London, primarily in Wandsworth.\r\nThe length of school placement is 120 days over the two placements In addition to the class teachers you will have a subject mentor, a  school mentor as well as your IOE/UCL mentor to support you through these placements. You will always be supported in your classroom teaching and all our schools have extensive in house  training programmes. The Alliance runs several extra workshops throughout the training .\r\nWe have  special schools , primary schools  and Children Centres in our Alliance and we encourage our students to take advantage by visiting to gain a wide understanding of the educational landscape.\r\nAt all times we keep you at the centre of the learning process and we work hard to ensure you have a challenging but supportive experience. ","personalQualities":"The Wandle Teaching School Alliance wishes to recruit high quality graduates committed to developing themselves as outstanding teachers. We are looking for candidates who have high expectations for their students. You should be a good communicator, enjoy challenge and have a love of learning. You will need to be resilient, flexible and hard working. We expect you to have excellent subject knowledge and the ability to build a strong rapport with students of all abilities. It also helps to have a sense of humour and, most importantly of all, to like and respect children. ","otherRequirements":"We strongly recommend that you spend some time observing teaching and learning in an inner London school before applying or whilst waiting for interview. \r\nThis is important as teaching and learning is a dynamic process and changes in pedagogy and curriculum content may mean classrooms are   very different places from when you last were in school. It is therefore important  to spend some time in a school so as you can reflect on what you have learned in your PGCE interviews.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:53:54.028Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-26T08:13:32.728Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2024"}
