What unifies these is the subject of Design and the development of designing competence. \r\n\r\nThis programme prepares you to teach in two broad areas. You specialise in one area to Key Stage 4 and beyond, and in another to Key Stage 3. Key Stage 4 specialist fields are Materials and Textiles and Key Stage 3 specialist fields are Materials, Textiles, Electronics and Communications Technology and Food. \r\n\r\nDuring the Autumn term, you are placed in your first  Wandle TSA school. The aim is induction,  into schooling, the teaching of design and technology,  into learning and teaching practices and you will progressively take on teaching activities  in tandem with the class teacher \r\n\r\nSpring and Summer terms are devoted to teaching practice in a second school, developing your competence to meet the Professional Standards. You design a scheme of work for the Key Stage 3 curriculum and develop your understanding of pupil learning styles, assessment and examinations. \r\n\r\nCollege seminars examine the nature of Design and Technology education. By the end of the programme you must offer a second area of competence to teach to the end of Key Stage 3, as well as your specialist area at Key Stages 4 and 5. You engage in two design activities: one in the first term and the second throughout the year. The first activity is mirrored by the same project being undertaken by Year 9 pupils in a local school and culminates in a shared presentation. The second activity culminates in a presentation of a personal design-and-make project to your peers to consider and reflect on the nature of the process of designing. \r\nThe Goldsmiths PGCE courses are offered either at Higher level (H level) or at Masters level (M level),and you will need to opt for one of these routes early on in the first term. \r\n Professional Graduate Certificate in Education at H (Higher/Professional) level made up of four modules, each worth 30 credits. They may be all at H level or three modules at H level and one at M level to make 120 credits. \r\n Postgraduate Certificate in Education at M (Masters) level also requires you to achieve four 30-credit modules, but two of the modules must be at M level and two must be at H level. \r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Applicants who are shortlisted are invited to a  Wandle TSA selection day. Candidates should allow a full day for this and dress appropriately. Candidates will be asked to complete a set of tasks; this will include two written tasks, an oral presentation f your portfolio of work and an  interview with school subject specialists. Goldsmiths subject tutors may attend the selection day and take part in the final stage interviews.\r\nIf successful, candidates will be recommended to Goldsmiths University. who will make a conditional offer. Applicants will have 10 days to accept or reject the offer. \r\n Candidates will also have to be certified as meeting the national requirements for physical and mental fitness to teach. Goldsmiths University will ask candidates to complete a health questionnaire for scrutiny by their occupational health provider. Candidates are responsible for the cost of obtaining occupational health clearance, which is approximately £45. Candidates will also be required to apply for an Enhanced Disclosure certificate from the DBS as a condition of entry. \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Wandle TSA PGCE School Direct students will have two school placements. These will be in two of our partner schools and will offer you a contrasting school experience, for example, one placement in a mixed school and a second in a single sex school.  We will discuss with you the best school to have your placements taking into account your travel requirements. All our School Direct students are invited to spend the first week of term with their first placement school as an early induction and to gain invaluable experience in participating in the beginning of term. This also allows many of the induction processes to be carried out and for you to get to know staff, systems and students. The age range will be from 11 to 18 and you will be required to teach across two stages in your placement, Key Stage 3 and 4 or 5 when you join us for your formal placements and training.\r\nWe have seven  secondary partner schools in our alliance. These schools are situated in SW London, primarily in Wandsworth and Lambeth and all schools have excellent transport links.\r\nThe length of school placement is 120 days over the two placements In addition to the class teachers you will have a subject mentor, a  school mentor as well as your Goldsmiths mentor to support you through these placements. You will always be supported in your classroom teaching and all our schools have extensive in house  training programmes. The Alliance runs several extra workshops throughout the training .\r\nWe have  special schools , primary schools  and Children centres in our Alliance and we encourage our students to take advantage by visiting to gain a wide understanding of the educational landscape.\r\nAt all times we keep you at the centre of the learning process and we work hard to ensure you have a challenging but supportive experience. ","personalQualities":"The Wandle Teaching School Alliance wishes to recruit high quality graduates committed to developing themselves as outstanding teachers. We are looking for candidates who have high expectations for their students. You should be a good communicator, enjoy challenge and have a love of learning. You will need to be resilient, flexible and hard working. We expect you to have excellent subject knowledge and the ability to build a strong rapport with students of all abilities. It also helps to have a sense of humour and, most importantly of all, to like and respect children. ","otherRequirements":"We strongly recommend that you spend some time observing teaching and learning in an inner London school before applying or whilst waiting for interview. \r\nThis is important as teaching and learning is a dynamic process and changes in pedagogy and curriculum content may mean classrooms are   very different places from when you last were in school. It is therefore important  to spend some time in a school so as you can reflect on what you have learned in your PGCE interviews.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:53:53.886Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-23T09:56:46.457Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2024"}
