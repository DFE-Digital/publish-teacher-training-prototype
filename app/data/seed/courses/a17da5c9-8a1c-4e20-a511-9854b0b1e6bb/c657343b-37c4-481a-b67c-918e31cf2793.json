The Religious Education PGCE also enables students to reflect upon the aims of religious education and how different pedagogies can support learners to develop key religious education skills and be challenged and excited by the world today. The programme prepares religious education student teachers to teach the 11-16 age range.\r\n\r\nStudents undertake two level 7 (Master’s-level) modules of 30 credits each, totalling 60 credits. These credits can be carried forward onto full Master’s programmes at the IOE (check individual programme requirements).\r\n\r\nThe Secondary PGCE consists of three core modules: two Master’s-level (level 7) modules, which are assessed through written assignments, and the Professional Practice module, which is assessed by the observation of practical teaching in placement schools.\r\nCompulsory modules\r\nWider Educational Studies - Religious Education (30 Level 7 credits)\r\nSubject Studies -Religious Education (30 Level 7 credits)\r\nProfessional Practice Module - Level 6\r\nOptional modules\r\nThere are no optional modules for this programme\r\nTeaching at UCL-IOE is mostly through seminars and workshops in your teaching base group of about twenty trainee teachers, with additional keynote and subject lectures, tutorials and directed study days, as well as time spent in placements. Assessment is by practical teaching, assignments and portfolio tasks.\r\nWandle RE teachers and mentors will compliment and support your university learning by developing your classroom practice to have the greatest impact on student learning, achievement and attainment.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/courses/teacher-training/religious-education-pgce\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Applicants who are shortlisted are invited to a  Wandle TSA selection day. Candidates should allow a full day for this and dress appropriately. Candidates will be asked to complete a set of tasks; this will include a written task, an oral presentation , student based task and an  interview with school subject specialists. \r\nIf successful, candidates will be recommended to the IOE/UCL for an interview by the IOE/UCL subject specialist team. Candidates should allow a full day for this and dress appropriately. If successful at this stage, the IOE/UCL will make a conditional offer. Applicants will have 10 days to accept or reject the offer. \r\n Candidates will also have to be certified as meeting the national requirements for physical and mental fitness to teach. The IOE/UCL will ask candidates to complete a health questionnaire for scrutiny by their occupational health provider. Candidates are responsible for the cost of obtaining occupational health clearance, which is approximately £45. Candidates will also be required to apply for an Enhanced Disclosure certificate from the DBS as a condition of entry. \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Wandle TSA PGCE School Direct students will have two school placements. These will be in two of our partner schools and will offer you a contrasting school experience, for example, one placement in a mixed school and a second in a single sex school.  We will discuss with you the best school to have your placements taking into account your travel requirements. All our School Direct students are invited to spend the first week of term with their first placement school as an early induction and to gain invaluable experience in participating in the beginning of term. This also allows many of the induction processes to be carried out and for you to get to know staff, systems and students. The age range will be from 11 to 18 and you will be required to teach across two stages in your placement, Key Stage 3 and 4 or 5 when you join us for your formal placements and training.\r\nWe have seven  secondary partner schools in our alliance. These schools are situated in SW London, primarily in Wandsworth and Lambeth and all schools have excellent transport links.\r\nThe length of school placement is 120 days over the two placements In addition to the class teachers you will have a subject mentor, a  school mentor as well as your IOE/UCL mentor to support you through these placements. You will always be supported in your classroom teaching and all our schools have extensive in house  training programmes. The Alliance runs several extra workshops throughout the training .\r\nWe have  special schools , primary schools  and Children centres in our Alliance and we encourage our students to take advantage by visiting to gain a wide understanding of the educational landscape.\r\nAt all times we keep you at the centre of the learning process and we work hard to ensure you have a challenging but supportive experience. ","personalQualities":"The Wandle Teaching School Alliance wishes to recruit high quality graduates committed to developing themselves as outstanding teachers. We are looking for candidates who have high expectations for their students. You should be a good communicator, enjoy challenge and have a love of learning. You will need to be resilient, flexible and hard working. We expect you to have excellent subject knowledge and the ability to build a strong rapport with students of all abilities. It also helps to have a sense of humour and, most importantly of all, to like and respect children. ","otherRequirements":"We strongly recommend that you spend some time observing teaching and learning in an inner London school before applying or whilst waiting for interview. \r\nThis is important as teaching and learning is a dynamic process and changes in pedagogy and curriculum content may mean classrooms are   very different places from when you last were in school. It is therefore important  to spend some time in a school so as you can reflect on what you have learned in your PGCE interviews.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:53:54.061Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-26T08:14:22.649Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2024"}
