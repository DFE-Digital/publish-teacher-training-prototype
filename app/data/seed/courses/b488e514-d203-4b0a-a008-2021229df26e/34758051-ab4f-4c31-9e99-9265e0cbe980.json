Trainees learn how to use current theory to inform their classroom practice and attention is paid to ensuring that trainees have a detailed understanding of English as a school subject, as well as outstanding skills in learning to plan and teach lessons which are creative and engaging.\r\n\r\nSubject studies are taught by a team of highly experienced practising classroom teachers who have worked with trainees over many years, with experience of teaching at school and university level.\r\n\r\nAstra trainees spend four days per week in their placement schools (minimum of 120 days across the year). All training and assessment will lead to the award of Qualified Teacher Status by the DfE. \r\n\r\nYour curriculum will follow the core content framework, with final assessment against the Teachers' Standard,  based on evidence of your teaching, wider contribution to school life and the ability to reflect on and evaluate these experiences.  Progress is monitored through weekly reflections on progress, objective setting, regular lesson observations and two QTS assignments.\r\n\r\nWeekly QTS Professional Studies will develop understanding of education essential for entrants to the teaching profession, providing consideration to whole-school issues, such as behaviour management, special educational needs and educational theories that contextualise the teaching of your subject. Secondary subject studies also focus on the teaching of each subject, including its place in the National Curriculum; what is taught; how it is taught; how it is assessed; providing for young people with different backgrounds and abilities; teaching in accordance with examination specification requirements; and using ICT effectively to facilitate learning.\r\n\r\nSalaried trainees are contracted to be an employee of their main placement school and are likely to be accountable for up to a 50% timetable across four days from the start of the course.  This allocation will increase as the training year progresses.  Time in school will also be allocated for observing experienced teachers, team teaching, working with groups of students and getting involved in the wider aspects of school life.  \r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"There are three Teaching School Hubs operating on behalf of the Astra SCITT:\r\nAstra SCITT/Astra Amersham Hub - Amersham and surrounding area\r\nAstra Aylesbury Hub - Aylesbury / surrounding area\r\nAstra Marlow Hub - Marlow / Maidenhead \r\nCandidates should apply via DfE Apply to their preferred Astra SCITT Hub, which will then coordinate the recruitment process. If your application is shortlisted, candidates will be invited for a first stage interview at one of our Hub locations.   \r\n\r\nThe application and interview process for each hub is identical and is quality assured by the SCITT leadership team. It will take one of the following formats: \r\n1. Stage 1 will be conducted remotely and consist of a panel interview, delivery of a short presentation, and some written tasks.  If successful at this stage, you will be invited to attend a Stage 2 interview, which will, where possible involve a visit to your potential main placement school to be observed leading a teaching activity with a small group of students; you will be told in advance about the content of the lesson you will need to plan, and the age group you will be teaching.  \r\n2. Stages 1 and 2 will both be conducted remotely, with you being asked to ‘teach’ part of a lesson to the interview panel following the main panel interview\r\n\r\nPlease note that applicants for salaried positions may be asked to teach a full lesson and/or complete other tasks which the employing school may specify.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We endeavour to match the right trainee to the right partner school for their main placement based on their initial preference, geography / distance from home, and areas of specific interest.

Trainees will also be expected to attend an induction day with their main placement school ahead of the September course start.  \r\n\r\nQTS studies take place with the SCITT every Wednesday, with the other four days per week being spent in school (approximately 120 days across the year). Bursary-led / unsalaried trainee timetable allocations is approximately 30% in the first term, rising to a maximum allocation of 75% in the final placement out of the four days in school.   Salaried trainees on contracts with their employing school will be expected to teach a 50% timetable in their first term.\r\n\r\nAstra has over 50 partners signed up to the SCITT Partnership Agreement which demands that each school supplies dedicated and high quality one-to-one Mentor support and in-school Professional Studies to complement the core QTS programme offered by the SCITT each week.  Trainees will also be expected to attend events such as parents’ evening and contribute to report writing during the year.  While there is no guarantee of permanent employment with placement schools, a considerable number of our trainees do go on to secure employment within our partnership.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-10-11T15:03:59.419Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-11T15:12:30.250Z","canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","cycle":"2024","salaryDetails":"The salary for a Salaried trainee is usually the minimum point of the Unqualified Teacher pay scale.
