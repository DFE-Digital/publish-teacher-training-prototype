You will be allocated your first school place in the summer term before you start your course and you will have the opportunity to meet other students on your SSELP School Direct course, your school based mentor and classroom teacher, and visit your Home school before the start of the summer holidays. This means that you will feel well prepared before starting in September. \r\n\r\nSchool placements are only finalised after talking to you about your requirements and training needs. We then select the best school to meet your needs and inform you and the schools before the summer holidays.\r\nThe school placement works on an AB pattern. You will spend the first part of your course, up to the end of December, in your first school and the second part of your course, from January to June, in a different school and a different key stage.\r\n\r\n You will be required to experience both Key Stages so each school placement will be in a different key stage.
