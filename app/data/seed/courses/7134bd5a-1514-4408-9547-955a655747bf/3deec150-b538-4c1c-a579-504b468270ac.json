Our accredited provider is the London School for Jewish Studies. Within the consortium like schools will operate in clusters.\r\n\r\nOur mission is to increase the number of teachers delivering high quality primary education in the Jewish sector. We offer a unique opportunity for specialist teachers of Jewish Studies / Limmudei Kodesh and general primary practitioners to develop their teaching, personal and professional conduct within our schools.\r\n\r\nThrough our programme candidates will experience training and placements in schools of similar ethos where possible. Candidates will have an opportunity to align their placements with their own ethos.\r\n\r\nAbout this training programme\r\n\r\nThe programme is based on the initial teaching competencies. Across the year candidates will learn about each of these areas through research, have an opportunity to observe them in practice and reflect on how they will implement this learning in their classroom. We offer a specialist Jewish Studies / Kodesh track.\r\n\r\nCandidates in the programme will be based in a class setting at the home school and expected to lead a class. Time and in school mentoring support will be given for the training programme . Throughout the year candidates will be observed by the home school and external accreditors.\r\n\r\nOpportunities have been built into the programme for members of the programme to work collaboratively. Candidates will be employed by the home school for the duration of the programme on the unqualified teachers scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Candidates will be required to attend an interview at one of our host schools.\r\n\r\nDuring the interview you will be required to teach a sample lesson, complete a short task and be interviewed by a panel.\r\n\r\nFollowing the interview successful candidates will either be \r\n - confirmed as being hosted by their existing school or\r\n- candidates not from a school will be matched with a host school.
