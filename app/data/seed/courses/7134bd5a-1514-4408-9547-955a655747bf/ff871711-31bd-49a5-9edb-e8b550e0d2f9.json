We offer a unique opportunity for specialist teachers of Jewish Studies / Limmudei Kodesh and general primary practitioners to develop their teaching, personal and professional conduct within our schools.\r\n \r\nThrough our programme candidates will experience training and placements in schools of similar ethos where possible. Candidates will have an opportunity to align their placements with their own ethos.\r\n \r\nAbout this training programme:\r\n \r\nThe programme is based on the initial teaching competencies. Across the year candidates will learn about each of these areas through research, have an opportunity to observe them in practice and reflect on how they will implement this learning in their classroom. We offer a specialist Jewish Studies / Kodesh track.\r\n\r\nCandidates in the programme will be based in a class setting at the home school and expected to lead a class. Time and in school mentoring support will be given for the training programme . Throughout the year candidates will be observed by the home school and external accreditors.\r\n\r\nOpportunities have been built into the programme for members of the programme to work collaboratively.
