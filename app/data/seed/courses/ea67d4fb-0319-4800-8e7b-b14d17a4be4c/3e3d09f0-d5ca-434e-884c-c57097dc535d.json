Trainees spend Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday training on the job in their schools. They then meet together as a group on Tuesdays with the MSC at Crispin School for Professional Training. MSC staff are always present on Tuesdays to answer questions and provide 1 to 1 support for trainees.\r\n\r\nProfessional Training is run by current practitioners and MSC staff and is tailored to ensure that trainees have appropriate pedagogical input at the different stages of their development as teachers.  We practice what we preach ensuring a balance of modelling techniques and strategies with current research. We also visit other partnership schools which are leaders in their particular fields of expertise so that trainees get a great breadth of training and are fully prepared for their first year in teaching.\r\n\r\n A mentor in school is at hand to offer advice and support to each trainee. Trainees are observed and given feedback at least once per week. Mentors are trained by the MSC and are further supported through visits to school by MSC tutors.\r\n\r\nOur programme starts on 1st September and ends on 30th June. Trainees are in school from day 1 and are regarded as full members of the school community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have excellent outcomes for our trainees; we were ranked 27 out of 153 secondary trainers across the UK in the Good Teacher Training Guide 2017.","interviewProcess":"The MSC operates a two stage interview process. \r\n\r\nStage 1 Interview-\r\nSuccessful applicants will be invited to an initial interview at the MSC Training Centre after which shortlisting will take place.The interview will be conducted by MSC personnel and representatives from the partnership. This will generally take place at the MSC's lead School, Crispin School, Street. The interview will include\r\n* a general panel interview\r\n* a 30 minute written task\r\n* a pupil activity\r\n\r\nAs a trainee teacher, teachers will be expected to deliver aspects of the Personal, Social and Health Education/Citizenship programme with pupils. Part of the selection process during interview 1 will involve applicants leading a 12 minute activity on a pre-chosen topic. \r\n\r\nStage 2 Interview-\r\nIf successful at stage 1, an offer of a second interview will be sent to successful candidates. The second stage of the interview takes place in a partnership school and is subject specific; candidates will normally be expected to work with a group of pupils. It aims to match the candidate with an appropriate department for training. In this way a \"best fit\" for the school, department and trainee can be established which results in the best possible outcomes for all parties. The interview will include\r\n* a general panel interview\r\n* approximately a 30 minute micro teach (subject specific) \r\n\r\n\r\nCandidates should be prepared to attend 2 interview dates.\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We try and match candidates with their home schools at second interview; this enables both the school and candidate to make informed decisions before they offer/accept a place to train. We try to ensure that travel times are kept as low as possible between trainees' schools and home. Getting it right before the training course starts ensures a more successful placement. \r\n\r\nDue to the changeability in staffing we do not always know when a school is able to accommodate a salaried trainee therefore we will (with the candidate's permission) circulate the application form within the partnership to ascertain where there are training opportunities. We are not able to always guarantee that places are available at a given time.\r\n\r\nSome schools come to us with candidates in mind. If the school can offer a suitable placement then this may be the home school placement for the trainee (interview procedures still apply).\r\n\r\nTrainees have to spend 4 weeks in a second school. The trainee is free to choose where this is as long as it provides a complementary experience from the home school. This placement takes place straight after Christmas. The trainees then return to their home schools. Sometimes salaried trainees 'swap' placements and take on each others' classes. In other cases the trainees may find that they are 'supernumerary' and work alongside experienced teachers.\r\n\r\nWe work with most of the secondary schools in Somerset and North Dorset. The majority of our schools are 11-16 although some do have sixth forms. We try and ensure that all trainees have some experience of post sixteen during their course.","personalQualities":"Well Organised.\r\nResilient.\r\nHard working.\r\nPatient.\r\nCreative.\r\nGood communicator.\r\nPassionate about working with young people.\r\nEnthusiastic about your subject area.\r\n","otherRequirements":"Candidates must have teaching experience in state funded secondary schools.\r\nDBS clearance.\r\nSatisfactory References.\r\nEligibility to study in the UK.\r\nProof of adequate subject knowledge to teach your subject if your degree is in another subject.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:51:21.391Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-15T07:14:19.304Z","canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","cycle":"2023","salaryDetails":"At least point 1 of the unqualified Teachers' Scale.
