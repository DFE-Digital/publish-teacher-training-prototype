Placements will provide experiences in EYFS and Key Stage 1. The first term will be in KS1 to ensure that knowledge and theory from teaching can be embedded. Trainees will then move into an EYFS setting during thier alternative placement. \r\nSchool based training alongside training sessions and high quality tutoring and mentoring will provide opportunities for trainees to plan, teach and manage learning for children aged 3-7 years. Trainees will therefore have the ability to assess and progress learning, build professional relationships and maintain high quality learning environments. \r\nSpecialist sessions will be provided by an SLE in Early Years supported by other relevant personnel to ensure that the trainees have a broad view of the EYFS provision. Additional sessions will allow trainees to experience specialist knowledge at a greater depth and couple it with tasks and experiences in their host schools\r\n[Click here](https://www.inspiringleadersscitt.com/the-course)","interviewProcess":"“Leaders are constantly evaluating the recruitment and selection processes to make sure they attract high-quality candidates with the skills, the moral purpose and the ‘staying power’ to be a successful teacher” – Ofsted 2017\r\n\r\n\r\nSelecting the right people to train with us in our schools is of utmost importance.\r\nOur interviews are now virtual using MS Teams/Zoom and  we aim to make you feel relaxed enough to show us who you really are.\r\nThe interview includes includes: \r\n•\tan opportunity to find out more about us;\r\n•\tan formal interview in which we find out more about you and establish whether you are suitable to train with us and in our schools;\r\n•\tA lesson talk through that you will pre-plan which the interviewer will then ask you to expand on during the interview.
