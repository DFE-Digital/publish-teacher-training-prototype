The combination of face to face training, online learning and 1-1 personalised feedback will enable you to develop the skills, knowledge and experiences needed to be a successful and highly respected teacher. \r\n\r\nThe BTSA and its partner schools provide in-school training and teaching practice supported by highly skilled mentors and their departments. Mentors will meet with you formally for a minimum of one hour per week and ensure that you receive a formal lesson observation every week with targeted feedback. \r\nYou and others in your cohort will meet on a regular basis to participate in training and discuss your views and opinions. In this way you will establish the confidence to use your personality in the classroom and develop your own personal style.  \r\n\r\nYou will be treated as a member of the school staff from the moment you start and as such have the opportunity to have a real impact on the life of the school. This also brings great accountability as what you do really does matter. \r\n\r\nTES Institute, our strategic partner provides you with high-quality on-line learning materials, many of which are delivered by national experts in their field. These are studied in your host school during the designated study day.  Highly qualified and experienced Pathway Tutors (external mentor) will provide you with the interactive feedback and will support and challenge you, along with the school mentor, throughout the programme. \r\n\r\nYour pathway tutor will monitor your progress in these learning modules with interactive feedback. They will visit you a minimum of six times in the year, for half a day per half term. During their visits they will observe you teaching and provide bespoke feedback on what they have seen. Specific objectives will then be agreed for you to deliberately practice. Monitoring of your progress will be ongoing as you progressively gain the skills and knowledge needed to be effective in the classroom. \r\n\r\nThe course is assessed through observations by your mentor, your external tutor and the senior managers of your school. You will compile a portfolio of evidence against the Teachers’ Standards across the year, completed by the end of the course. There will also be three written assignments if opting for the PGCE route and two assignments for QTS only.","interviewProcess":"We will assess your application form to see if you have met our entry requirements.
