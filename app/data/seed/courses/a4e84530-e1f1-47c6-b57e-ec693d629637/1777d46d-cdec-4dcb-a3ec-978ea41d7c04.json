Your progress will be assessed using an electronic document that allows mentor and trainees to track their progress and training and to set realistic and achievable targets throughout their training year. It is used at key review points during mentor meetings and allows trainees to focus on their progress linked clearly to the the curriculum. It is a formative document that allows both the trainee and mentor to track training and progress towards the award of QTS. \r\n\r\nThe mentoring model used by Marjon recognises as need for flexibility in approach. Mentors are aware that each trainee progresses at different speeds, so critical element to our model is the mentor’s ability to provide the appropriate support to address the trainee’s competence and confidence levels at a point in time. You become more autonomous as you progress and are empowered to take responsibility for your own learning. Trainees are more likely to reach their full potential on courses that encourage them to develop as independent learners and the best teaching supports this process.\r\n\r\nAll placements are flexible and adapt according to Department for Education guidance.\r\n","personalQualities":"\r\n* Personal Qualities of Confidence/enthusiasm/sensitivity/ maturity/potential to be a positive role model\r\n* Resilience through Commitment/perseverance/versatility/tenacity/stamina\r\n* The desire to work collaboratively with Teacher Education Partnership \r\n* The willingness to listen to and respond to feedback from Teacher Education Partnership \r\n* The ability to demonstrate a culture of high expectations for themselves and their pupils.\r\n* The desire to strive to plan, teach and assess in ways that enable pupils to make good or better progress in their lessons \r\n","otherRequirements":"A satisfactory DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service check).\r\n\r\nWe have a responsibility to ensure that trainees have the health and physical capacity to teach.
