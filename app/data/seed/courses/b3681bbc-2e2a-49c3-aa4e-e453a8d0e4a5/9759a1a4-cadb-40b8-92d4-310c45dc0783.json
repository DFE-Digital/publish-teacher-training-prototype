Here you will engage in core practice and learn the professional values of teaching.\r\n\r\nCandidates will be required to have an A level (or equivalent)  in maths at A/B or evidence of study of maths within their degree.\r\n\r\nSchools are keen to employ teachers at primary level with a deep understanding of mathematics. As a subject specialist, you may well strive to become a mathematics subject leader or primary specialist as your career progresses. This focus on additional study in mathematics will give you a competitive edge in terms of employment opportunities and open up possibilities for career development. \r\n\r\nOn our PGCE, you will cover all primary subjects with a focus on maths as a specialist route. Our programme will provide you with an understanding of the National Curriculum in all primary subjects and the essential learning needs of children. \r\n\r\nAdditional mathematics will focus on deepening your understanding at a primary level, not accelerating into higher mathematics. During your time with us, you will develop your professional values and practice so you can meet the broad demands of teaching.\r\n\r\nIn addition to school-based training, studies also take place at the university's campus and cover all elements of the National Curriculum. \r\n\r\nOur workshops are interactive and encourage you to work collaboratively.
