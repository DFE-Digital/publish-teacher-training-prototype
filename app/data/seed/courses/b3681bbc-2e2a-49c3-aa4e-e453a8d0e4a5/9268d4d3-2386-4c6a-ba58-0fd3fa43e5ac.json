They are very much the first choice for employers in the local and wider London region.\"\r\n\r\nOur PGCE in Primary Education (postgraduate and professional routes) will enable you to develop your knowledge, understanding and skills to teach in primary schools - particularly those in the urban inner-city. Here, you will engage in core practice and learn the professional values of teaching.\r\n\r\nYou will have the opportunity to train in two consecutive age ranges:\r\n\r\n* Foundation/Key Stage 1\r\n* Key Stage 1/Key Stage 2\r\n* Key Stage 2 (which encompasses both ages 7-9 and 9-11)\r\n\r\nIn addition to school-based training, studies also take place at the university's campus and cover all elements of the National Curriculum. \r\n\r\nOur workshops are interactive and encourage you to work collaboratively. These include practical tasks and exploring theoretical perspectives. Opportunities are also provided for you to take an enhancement in an area of personal interest or expertise, e.g. special educational needs.\r\n\r\nOur expert staff are active researchers as well as being trained primary teachers. During the programme, you will be allocated a personal tutor who will support your studies. Your tutor will be on hand to offer both personal career and academic guidance.
