Our course structure follows a coherent 3-week cycle starting with an Academic Tutorial for each aspect of pedagogy that you will look at.  After some time in school, this is followed by a practical workshop led by practicing teachers who are expert practitioners.  The workshops are designed to develop strategies and skills for the classroom as well as opportunities to network with other trainees and reflect on practice.   Finally you are supported to implement what you have learnt in your own teaching by your school mentors.\r\n\r\nHub days also include show and tell sessions where you can share something that has worked well, a challenge or good resource, and reflection sessions to revisit your practice at regular intervals.  \r\n\r\nWe also have our own SCITT book club with the challenge to read as many of the books as possible by the end of the year!\r\n\r\nAssessment for this course is through school experience (placements), a Reflective Portfolio which is primarily based online and consists of elements such as development records, Academic Tutorial work, school-based tasks and presentations where you focus on a particular theme/topic/class and share your reflections about your development and impact on learning.\r\n\r\nThe next full and part-time programmes will start in September 2021 and, for those trainees that meet the Teachers’ Standards, finish in June/July 2022 (full-time - dates TBC) or sometime in 2023 (part-time, dependent on timetable) ","interviewProcess":"Our aim is to be able to identify the highest quality candidates that meet our success criteria; those best prepared to begin QTS assessment and most likely to excellent teachers by the end of their training.  \r\n\r\nPlease note that the following information is subject to change due to the current COVID-19 pandemic.\r\n\r\nIf your application is successful, we will invite you to an interview at one of our partner schools.
