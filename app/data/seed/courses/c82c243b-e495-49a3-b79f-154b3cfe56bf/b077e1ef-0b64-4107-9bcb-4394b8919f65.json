Our course structure follows a coherent 3-week cycle starting with an Academic Tutorial for each aspect of pedagogy that you will look at.  After some time in school, this is followed by a practical workshop led by practicing teachers who are experts in their field.  The workshops are designed to develop strategies and skills for the classroom as well as opportunities to network with other trainees and reflect on practice.   Finally, you are supported to implement what you have learnt in your own teaching by your school mentors.\r\n\r\nHub days also include show and tell sessions where you can share something that has worked well, a challenge or good resource, and reflection sessions to revisit your practice at regular intervals.  \r\n\r\nWe also have our own SCITT book club with the challenge to read as many of the books as possible by the end of the year!\r\n\r\nAssessment for this course is through school experience (placements), a Reflective Portfolio which is primarily based online and consists of elements such as development records, Academic Tutorial work, school-based tasks and presentations where you focus on a particular theme/topic/class and share your reflections about your development and impact on learning.\r\n\r\nThe next full and part-time programmes will start in September 2022 and, for those trainees that meet the Teachers’ Standards, finish July 2023 (full-time) or sometime in 2024 (part-time, dependent on timetable) ","interviewProcess":"Our aim is to be able to identify the highest quality candidates that meet our success criteria; those best prepared to begin QTS assessment and most likely to excellent teachers by the end of their training.  \r\n\r\nIf your application is successful, we will invite you to an interview at one of our partner schools.

Instead, we will be considering your potential to become a teacher!\r\n\r\n* A 10-minute presentation about the British education system, that you have pre-prepared;\r\n\r\n* A 30-minute interview which will cover your reasons for wanting to teach, your understanding of the role of the teacher, your own skills and attributes and how these might support you in your training and current issues in education.\r\n\r\n* Document check (ID & qualifications);\r\n\r\n* Subject knowledge test (30 minutes) - designed to assess the breadth and depth of your knowledge in your subject.\r\n\r\n*If successful, you will then complete our literacy and numeracy diagnostics.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The placements you complete during your training year will give you a breadth of experience and provide a range of opportunities for you to demonstrate you have met all the Teachers’ Standards.\r\n\r\nWe currently have 6 excellent secondary partner schools with a proven track record of developing outstanding trainees.  \r\n\r\nThe SCITT operates an “ABA” placement pattern*: \r\n\r\n* Placement A (part 1) consists of 2 school induction days and 10 assessed teaching weeks.
