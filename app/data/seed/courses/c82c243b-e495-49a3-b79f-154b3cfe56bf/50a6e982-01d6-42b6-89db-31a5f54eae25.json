Our course structure follows a coherent 3-week cycle starting with an Academic Tutorial for each aspect of pedagogy that you will look at.  After some time in school, this is followed by a practical workshop led by practicing teachers who are experts in their field.  The workshops are designed to develop strategies and skills for the classroom as well as opportunities to network with other trainees and reflect on practice.   Finally, you are supported to implement what you have learnt in your own teaching by your school mentors.\r\n\r\nHub days also include show and tell sessions where you can share something that has worked well, a challenge or good resource, and reflection sessions to revisit your practice at regular intervals.  \r\n\r\nWe also have our own SCITT book club with the challenge to read as many of the books as possible by the end of the year!\r\n\r\nAssessment for this course is through school experience (placements), a Reflective Portfolio which is primarily based online and consists of elements such as development records, Academic Tutorial work, school-based tasks and presentations where you focus on a particular theme/topic/class and share your reflections about your development and impact on learning.\r\n\r\nThe next full and part-time programmes will start in September 2022 and, for those trainees that meet the Teachers’ Standards, finish July 2023 (full-time) or sometime in 2024 (part-time, dependent on timetable) ","interviewProcess":"Our aim is to be able to identify the highest quality candidates that meet our success criteria; those best prepared to begin QTS assessment and most likely to excellent teachers by the end of their training.  \r\n\r\nIf your application is successful, we will invite you to an interview at one of our partner schools.   The panel usually includes the SCITT Programmes Lead, a subject specialist and another ITT specialist.\r\n\r\nOur applicants tell us that our interview process is fair, rigorous and that they really enjoy the experience! \r\n\r\nThe interview process includes:\r\n\r\n* Teaching a 25-minute lesson based on a topic and class data which you will receive prior to interview.  We do take into account that you may never have taught before so we aren’t looking for a perfect lesson!  Instead, we will be considering your potential to become a teacher!\r\n\r\n* A 10-minute presentation about the British education system, that you have pre-prepared;\r\n\r\n* A 30-minute interview which will cover your reasons for wanting to teach, your understanding of the role of the teacher, your own skills and attributes and how these might support you in your training and current issues in education;\r\n\r\n* A spoken French and Spanish test (20-30 minutes);\r\n\r\n* Document check (ID & qualifications);\r\n\r\n* Subject knowledge test (30 minutes) - designed to assess the breadth and depth of your knowledge in your subject.\r\n\r\n*If successful, you will then complete our literacy and numeracy diagnostics.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The placements you complete during your training year will give you a breadth of experience and provide a range of opportunities for you to demonstrate you have met all the Teachers’ Standards.\r\n\r\nWe currently have 6 excellent secondary partner schools and 2 partner Post-16 colleges with a proven track record of developing outstanding trainees.  \r\n\r\nThe SCITT operates an “ABA” placement pattern*: \r\n\r\n* Placement A (part 1) consists of 2 school induction days and 10 assessed teaching weeks. This is your opportunity to develop your core teaching skills.\r\n\r\n* Placement B is in a contrasting school (11-16) or in a specialist Post-16 setting (11-18) . This placement consists of 2 induction days and 10 teaching weeks. It is an opportunity to focus on teaching in a contrasting setting so you can experience different things and develop your skills in different areas.\r\n\r\n* You will then return to Placement A (part 2) to further refine your skills in a school setting (a further 10 assessed teaching weeks).\r\nYou will then return to Placement A (part 2) to further refine your skills in a school setting (a further 10 assessed teaching weeks).\r\n\r\n(*These might vary slightly depending on each trainee's circumstances - i.e. where the Post-16 setting does not have a full timetable for the subject, trainees might attend a second school and do a specific number of days in the Post-16 setting).\r\n\r\nWe also have time dedicated to Enrichment Experiences which include:\r\n* Two days in a KS2 and two days in a KS5 setting;\r\n* Completion of a two-day Youth Mental Health First Aid Training course;\r\n* Most trainees may also spend a day in other educational settings. These might include visits to a Pupil Referral Unit, Special Needs schools/units, schools with specialisms, etc.\r\n\r\nWe take into consideration information given to us by successful candidates regarding travel constraints etc.\r\n\r\nPart-time calendars are created in negotiation with the trainee and their placement school – please [contact us](http://ytcascitt.co.uk/contact-us/) if you would like to discuss this further.
