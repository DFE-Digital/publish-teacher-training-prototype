There is no separate application procedure for this bursary. Instead, the University of Exeter makes an assessment using the household income information provided by the student's funding body (e.g. Student Finance England). Students must make sure that they and their sponsor(s) have given consent for details of their application to be shared with the University of Exeter. This consent to share is requested during the application for financial support, but can be given at any time throughout the year by contacting their student funding body. \r\n\r\nStudents who have not applied for financial support, or who have applied but chosen not to be means tested, are unable to be considered for this bursary until they do.","aboutCourse":"Trainees are based entirely in schools for the academic year. A programme of phase/subject specific training is designed and delivered by the lead school, and is linked to a Masters level programme provided by the university. This is comprised of two 30 credit modules delivered through the university's electronic learning platform, and supported by seminars and/or tutorials. These modules are designed to develop understanding of core issues in education, and to support ability to engage with relevant research and link theory to practice. One day a week (or equivalent) is assigned to this distance study.\r\n\r\nDuring the year, all trainees spend time in two schools, usually having one main 'home' school and a second 'contrasting' school. Lead schools decide the placement pattern, but the contrasting school experience will always last for a minimum of 6 weeks. One day a week (or equivalent) is assigned to distance study for the online Masters programme. Trainees follow the Exeter Model of initial teacher education.\r\n\r\nTrainees are registered with the university and are eligible for training bursaries and student loans.","interviewProcess":"","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We partner with 10 primary schools in a variety of contexts, from 40-child village schools to 400-strong town schools.
