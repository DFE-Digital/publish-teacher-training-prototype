Located across the Midlands, they will work together in clusters to support you on placement. The placements and enhanced school opportunities will provide you with challenging and exciting experiences.\r\n\r\nYou'll also spend time at the University of Derby, working in their excellent facilities with University and school-based tutors, in order to develop your growing understanding of what it takes to become a great teacher.\r\n\r\nHow you're assessed\r\nAll assessments relate to your school placements; you will complete three assessed teaching placements, two in your main school and one in a second school, and additional enhanced school opportunities, which will provide you with the challenging and exciting experience you need. There will be in-depth teacher enquiry on school-based issues.\r\n\r\nYou'll also have the opportunity to reflect on and discuss your developing subject knowledge of the core and wider curriculum subjects, as well as developing your skills in research-informed practice.","interviewProcess":"When applying, we will contact you to ask which school you are interested in training at.

At first, you will be given time to observe other teachers and get to know your class. You can then expect to progress more quickly to taking fuller responsibility for the class.
