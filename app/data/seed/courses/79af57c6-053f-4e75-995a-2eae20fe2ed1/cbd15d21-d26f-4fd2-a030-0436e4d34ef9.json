This may be enhanced by external trainers and industry experts.  These weeks develop subject knowledge, common misconceptions made by pupils.\r\n\r\nFollowing phase one of core training, induction and subject training, you will spend 10 weeks on placement A.  Initially co-teaching with experienced practitioners, you will develop your skills and confidence to be taking about 11 lessons a week by Christmas.  After the winter break you will enhance your teaching with three weeks of intensive training and subject development before embarking on placement B at a contrasting school.  You will again be teaching about 11 lessons a week for the six week period.  You are then back to you original placement until mid-June, working on your weekly targets with \"your\" classes.

The interview allows us to get to know you as a person, your interests and rationale for applying.  The taught session enables you to show you natural flair and how you interact with children.
