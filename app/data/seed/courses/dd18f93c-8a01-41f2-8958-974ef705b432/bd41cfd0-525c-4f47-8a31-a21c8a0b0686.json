Monday to Thursday are school based days, with Friday being 'training' day shared equally between school based training days in Durham and University based training days at Coach Lane Campus.\r\n\r\nOver the year, trainees are supported by their class mentor to develop their skills, with three observed placement periods of 5 weeks each across the year. The middle placement will take place in one of our other central Durham schools to give trainees experience in other school environments and with other age ranges of children, whilst retaining the similarities shared by our Durham schools.","interviewProcess":"Once you have applied, we will make contact with you very quickly.

A formal set of interview questions will then be shared with the lead mentor and head teacher.\r\n\r\n**some changes to interview process may be needed depending on the current COVID19 regulations.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The 8 schools in our partnership have been developed through the close relationships we have within the Durham area.
