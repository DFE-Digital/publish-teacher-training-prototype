In your application you can select a preferred location for one of these placements.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Competition for places is strong.\r\nYou are interviewed by a member of the host school's leadership team and a  tutor from the University. As part of the interview process you will be expected to deliver a short 'teaching' session to a small group of students and then have a one-to-one interview with the school team member and the university tutor.\r\nYou will also be expected to undertake some university admissions tests at the time of interview.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Trainees undertake two periods of teaching; one in the spring term and one in the summer. Each placement is of eight weeks’ duration and is preceded by two weeks of preparatory time in the placement school. The aim is to give every trainee a wide range of experience, encompassing pupils of different ages and schools of different size and type.\r\nWe work in partnership with over 150 primary-phase schools in the region, ranging from small, rural schools with approximately 50 pupils to large urban schools with over 600 pupils.\r\n\r\nFor each teaching placement, trainees are assigned a university tutor who offers support and guidance before and during the placement. This complements the role of the school mentor, who is able to monitor and assist the trainees’ development on a day-to-day basis.\r\n\r\nUniversity tutors and school mentors work closely in partnership with one another to ensure the best possible outcomes for all trainees.\r\n\r\nDuring the year trainees will have the opportunity to teach all primary curriculum subjects, with an emphasis on English and mathematics. The overall teaching load for the spring placement is 60-65%, with an increase in the summer to 70-75%. This provides a firm basis for the 80% teaching load during the NQT year.\r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for applicants with\r\n•\tA commitment to primary education\r\n•\tAn ability to motivate and inspire children of all abilities\r\n•\tEnergy and enthusiasm\r\n•\tEffective interaction with children\r\n•\tAn ability to work under pressure\r\n•\tPerseverance and flexibility\r\n•\tOral and written communication skills\r\n•\tThe ability to work co-operatively\r\n•\tAn awareness of current educational issues\r\n•\tA broad subject-knowledge base\r\n•\tReflection, self-evaluation and a willingness to learn\r\n•\tAwareness of what being a primary teacher entails\r\n","otherRequirements":"","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:49:09.167Z","updatedAt":"2021-08-06T09:48:16.909Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2023"}
