The aim is to give every trainee a wide range of experience, encompassing pupils of different ages and schools of different size and type.\r\nFor each teaching placement, trainees are assigned a university tutor who offers support and guidance before and during the placement. This complements the role of the school mentor, who is able to monitor and assist the trainees’ development on a day-to-day basis.\r\nUniversity tutors and school mentors work closely in partnership with one another to ensure the best possible outcomes for all trainees.\r\nYou can select a preference for one of your training placements on your application using the relevant placement code.\r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for applicants with\r\n•\tA commitment to secondary education\r\n•\tAn ability to motivate and inspire children of all abilities\r\n•\tEnergy and enthusiasm\r\n•\tEffective interaction with children\r\n•\tAn ability to work under pressure\r\n•\tPerseverance and flexibility\r\n•\tOral and written communication skills\r\n•\tThe ability to work co-operatively\r\n•\tAn awareness of current educational issues\r\n•\tA broad subject-knowledge base\r\n•\tReflection, self-evaluation and a willingness to learn\r\n•\tAwareness of what being a secondary teacher entails\r\n","otherRequirements":"","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:49:08.850Z","updatedAt":"2021-08-06T09:46:45.447Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2023"}
