During the training year, time is split between school based placements where you are immersed in school life to develop your teaching experience and structured taught sessions that focus on key educational theory and practice and develop your subject knowledge across the primary curriculum.\r\n\r\nAs a School Direct Trainee with Victoria Academies Trust, you will attend taught sessions at Birmingham University with a few additional twilight sessions taught by our own team of highly skilled, practising teachers. These additional sessions are based on pupil independence and our challenge based curriculum. They will be held within one of the Trust schools and often provide the opportunity to observe teaching in practice, in order to facilitate simulating and highly relevant training experiences and make immediate links between theory and practice.\r\n\r\nThe teaching commitment is built up over the training year during school placements, where you will be immersed in school life and supported by school-based practitioners who are experienced and skilled teachers within our schools.\r\n\r\nTrainees are assessed via evidence gathered during the teaching experiences, school-based tasks and formal assignments linked to key areas of teaching and learning.\r\n\r\nSuccessful completion of the course will result in QTS and PGDipEd.\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"We work in partnership with our accredited provider, the University of Birmingham, to co-ordinate the recruitment process.
