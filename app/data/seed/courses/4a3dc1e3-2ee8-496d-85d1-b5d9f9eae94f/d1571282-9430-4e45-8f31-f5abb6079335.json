They are interwoven through all aspects of our Initial Teacher Education ( ITE) Partnership curriculum and across university and school/early years setting training and will be recognisable to you during your time with us.\r\n\r\nThrough a carefully designed and sequenced ITE Partnership curriculum, and with the expertise, advice and support of both university and school/early years setting trainers, you will become a well-qualified and highly skilled teacher.\r\n\r\nWe offer optional specialisms in: English, mathematics, science, behaviour for learning, modern languages, physical education, English as an Additional Language, music  and the arts. Specialisms involve additional training and may require specific entry to the specialism requirements. Please contact 01225 875633 for further guidance.\r\n\r\nOur sequenced, integrated  Initial Teacher Education Partnership curriculum spans university and school phases. It comprises: English (Communication, Language and Literacy), Mathematics, Science (Understanding the world), Professional Studies, Teaching for Social Justice and Teachers as Researchers, as well as the full range of subjects across the primary and early years curricula. Throughout all phases of the programme you will gain, apply, and refine your teaching knowledge, pedagogy and classroom skills. As a developing professional teacher, you will have the privilege of impacting children’s learning, progress and well-being.\r\n\r\nAs part of your academic award, you will undertake assignments which will contribute 60 credits towards a Masters. These are informed by research, literature and theories that will enrich and enhance your professional practice.\r\n\r\nThroughout the programme, we will closely monitor and support your progress. You will be assigned an Academic Tutor in university who will regularly meet with you to review your progress. In school/early years setting you will also be supported by a Training Mentor who will support and review your progress in understanding and learning the ITE Partnership curriculum.\r\n\r\nAs a Bath Spa Teacher, you will be supported to develop professional behaviours, emotional resilience and encouraged to think critically about research, international initiatives and classroom practice. By the end of the programme you will become creative practitioners, critical thinkers, collaborative colleagues and professional teachers who care for and nurture the learners they teach.\r\n\r\n We regularly seek and respond to feedback from our trainees and schools/early years settings to continually improve the programme and ensure your professional needs are met. \r\n\r\n ","interviewProcess":"Interviews will be held virtually, using the online platform Google Meet. A presentation will be delivered by one of the PGCE Programme Leaders lasting approximately 1 hour. This presentation will provide more detailed information about the structure and nature of the PGCE with QTS programmes and you will have the opportunity to interact with other interviewees and ask questions. After the presentation you will be invited to take part in an individual interview with a university tutor and school colleague. You should allow up to an hour for the interview and your allocated time will be provided separately. \r\n\r\nInterview Activities\r\nWe will require you to undertake a number of activities as part of the interview process including: \r\nDiscussion of a micro teaching activity for a group of children\r\nDiscussion of the attributes that make an effective teacher\r\nEngagement with a piece of literature or research of your choice related to education\r\n \r\nAt the end of the interview there will be an opportunity to ask questions to clarify your understanding of the PGCE with QTS programmes. \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Bath Spa University Partnership: our partnership of schools span the  South West region, and beyond. Each year we work closely with over 250 partnership schools to ensure you get the very best training experience.\r\n\r\nBath Spa Teachers (BSTs): The Partnership believes that from the start of your journey to be a well-educated and highly skilled teacher you are a ‘professional teacher in training’. In recognition of this, you will hold the identity of a Bath Spa Teacher (BST), rather than a trainee. You will embrace the professional qualities and attributes expected of a professional teacher, and colleagues who train you will respect this status.\r\n\r\nWe offer 3-7, 5-11 and 7-11 routes within the Primary and Early Years programmes. As a BST on the 5-11 route you will train and be assessed in Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2. You will be an expert in your selected age phase, however you will not be limited to that age phase for your future teaching career.\r\n","personalQualities":"You’ll need to be well suited to the teaching profession both personally and academically. We look for people with a committed professional approach and an exceptional work ethic. You’ll need to be organised, flexible and unflappable, as well as being able to communicate, interact and relate well to everyone. When entering the teaching profession, having strong emotional resilience and a sense of humour will give you the edge.\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"During your training with us, we will implement, support and assure your competency in Fundamental English and mathematics, as required for the award of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS)\r\n\r\nFitness to train to teach check to ensure you are medically fit to take a teacher training course.\r\n\r\nDisclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks – this is the Government scheme, to enable the identification of people who are barred from working with children and vulnerable adults.
