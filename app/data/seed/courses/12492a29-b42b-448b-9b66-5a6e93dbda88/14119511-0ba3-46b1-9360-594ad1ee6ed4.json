Course/Tuition fees are paid by trainees although funding is often available through tuition fee loans, bursaries or scholarships.\r\n\r\nThe tuition fees for September 2019 entry are £9,250 for UK, EU and Islands (Channel Islands and Isle of Man) students; however, the tuition fees for students outside the EU are yet to be confirmed for 2019 entry. Please contact studentsandmoney@winchester.ac.uk in the autumn for confirmation of the fee.\r\n","aboutCourse":"You will follow a programme that, alongside classroom teaching, includes lesson observation, training within a host school, alliance based training days and time spent at university. Our schools have a close working relationship with The University of Winchester and a proven track record of success in training teachers and this is reflected in the training that is provided.\r\n\r\nThe course prepares you to teach across the age ranges 11-16 and is structured around six modules - a combination of taught modules based at the University and placement modules based in schools or educational settings.\r\n\r\nYou will undertake studies in all elements of secondary education; extend your knowledge of learning and teaching, of the breadth and scope of the curriculum and the professional skills associated with high-quality teaching. You will then apply these areas of understanding and skill to classroom practice throughout the year, including during two assessed placements in schools or educational settings.\r\n\r\nOur School Direct trainee teachers generally spend Monday to Thursday each week in school with either in-school or university based training on Fridays. Some Fridays are given to preparation for assignments or self-directed study.\r\n\r\nIn the first half term after Christmas, our trainee teachers spend six weeks in a second placement school and you will be in school for five days per weeks for most of these.\r\n\r\nSuccessful completion of the course leads to Qualified Teacher Status, a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) and credits towards a Master's Degree.\r\n\r\nAssessment of your teaching will take place throughout the year. There are more formal reviews of your in-school performance though and these take place at the following points:\r\n•\tat the end of the first full term\r\n•\tafter your second placement has been completed\r\n•\tat the end of your second full term \r\n•\ttowards the end of the Summer Term.\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Following the receipt of applications, there will be a shortlisting procedure involving representatives from partner schools who will look to match applicants with the most appropriate placements.\r\n\r\nWe interview all shortlisted applicants prior to making an offer to train with us. Interview panels include senior staff from alliance schools, heads of subject (secondary) and a representative from The University of Winchester.\r\n\r\nInterviews may include any of the following: a tour of the school; small group or class teaching; a Maths and written task; a verbal presentation; a formal interview; lesson observation; time within the relevant subject area for secondary applicants.\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"For much of the year, you will be based in your main host school for four days per week and you will be supported to develop your own classroom practice, learning from experienced teachers and receiving guidance and feedback from them. You will have a nominated in-school mentor who will support you on a day-to-day basis and you will have dedicated time to meet with them each week.\r\n\r\nGenerally, by the end of the first term, our School Direct trainee teachers are teaching about 50 per cent of a qualified teacher’s timetable. In order to prepare you for your Newly Qualified Teacher’s (NQT) year, this increases to approximately 60 and then 70 per cent in terms two and three respectively. Your main host school will always be a school that is part of Winchester Schools Partnership.\r\n\r\nFollowing a week of orientation, you will complete a six week second placement in another school after Christmas and there is flexibility around the nature of the school that you attend for this period. It is possible for you to undertake your placement in another WSP school but if you wish to experience teaching in a school in another area, we can generally arrange this for you. We always look to ensure that our trainee teachers have a broad and balanced experience but also try to respond to their individual interests where possible.\r\n\r\nAny questions about how school placements work or, indeed, any other queries, can be raised at interview.\r\n","personalQualities":"We will look for evidence of a commitment to the teaching profession, an understanding of professional requirements, and an awareness of current educational issues in an application. Prior experience in a school is not required; however, prospective students may find experience in a school useful for obtaining insights into the primary education classroom. Experience in a school or similar setting may also provide reassurance to prospective students that teaching is the right choice for their career.","otherRequirements":"If you accept an offer of a place, you will be required to complete a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) criminal records check and Prohibition Order check. If you have spent time overseas in the last 5 years you may also be required to obtain criminal records checks from each of the countries you visited. You will also be required to complete an occupational health check to confirm that you are fit to teach. The University of Winchester will send you more information about when and how you need to complete each of these checks if you accept our offer.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:49:20.198Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-28T10:13:01.000Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2023"}
