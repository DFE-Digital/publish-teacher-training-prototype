It is run by the University’s School of Education and Sociology  and offers the choice of following either the Professional Graduate Certificate in Education route (taking all modules at higher education level) or the Postgraduate Certificate in Education (with 60 credits towards a Master’s degree).\r\n\r\nEnglish is a core subject of the secondary curriculum at Key Stage 3 and 4. English is an engaging and constantly evolving subject in the school curriculum. On the PGCE course you will learn not only about issues related to English teaching and pedagogy, but also about developing an understanding of educational issues pertaining to teaching and learning, classroom interaction, school curriculum and school and society. As well as learning to become a competent classroom practitioner, you will learn to make important decisions and recognise the need for reflection and evaluation.\r\n\r\nCourse aims \r\nThe course is designed to enable you to become a capable and confident teacher at secondary level. Abilities to teach the National Curriculum and encourage learning will be developed alongside the skills and understanding required of effective teachers by the Teachers’ Standards.\r\n\r\nMode of study \r\nThis is a one-year full-time course (36 weeks) or two years part time.\r\n\r\nCourse outline: \r\nThe English course integrates theory with practice and two-thirds of your time will be spent in a school, where you will be working closely with mentors and other school staff.\r\n\r\nThroughout the year you will be engaged in considering a range of subjects including: subject knowledge enhancement, lesson planning, retrieval practice, classroom management, adaptive learning and current theories around English pedagogy and what constitutes best practice in the English classroom.\r\n\r\nSchool partnerships: \r\nThe University works closely in partnership with a number of schools. Two thirds of your time is spent in schools, where you will receive the support of school-based mentors required of the school’s teaching staff.\r\n\r\nYou will spend an increasing amount of time in school as the course progresses, beginning in Term One with three days per week. In Term Two, four days a week and in Term Three, five days a week. The emphasis throughout will be on helping you to gain progressively more confidence and competence in order to attain an increasing level of responsibility in the classroom.","interviewProcess":"We hold our interviews in Portsmouth and during yours, you'll need to demonstrate your knowledge and experience of your subject and the school system. We’ll send you an audit form to help you think about how your subject knowledge fits with the syllabus you want to teach, and how you might fill any gaps.\r\n \r\nYou’ll also be tested on reading and writing, take part in a group discussion, and will be asked to prepare a ‘microteaching’ lesson: ten minutes of teaching on a subject, skill or interest of your choice that you’ll deliver to your fellow applicants on the day.\r\nWe’ll be looking at all aspects of the application process – application form, academic reference, and the elements of the interview day – in order to get the fullest picture of you. We’re hoping to see that you’ve got the personal and intellectual qualities to be a teacher, and that you can meet the Teachers’ Standards by the end of your training.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"School-based work is an important part of our PGCE Programme and all of our partner schools have specially trained mentors who assist students in learning to teach. This mentoring programme is essential in the development of new teachers and will be a valuable asset in your training as you gain hands-on experience of practising your new skill in actual classroom environments.","personalQualities":"","otherRequirements":"All shortlisted applicants are subject to interview.
