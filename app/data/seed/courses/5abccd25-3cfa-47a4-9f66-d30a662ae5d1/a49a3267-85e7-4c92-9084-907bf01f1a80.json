Computing is a compulsory National Curriculum subject in Secondary education which has computer science as its foundation. It is run by the University’s School of Education and Sociology and offers the choice of following either the Professional Graduate Certificate in Education route (taking all modules at higher education level) or the Postgraduate Certificate in Education (with 60 credits towards a Master’s degree). The most appropriate route for you can be discussed with the course leader.\r\n\r\nOn the PGCE course you will learn not only about teaching Computer Science, but also the wider context relating to the applications of it (IT) and the development of digital literacy. You will also learn about developing an understanding of educational issues pertaining to teaching and learning, classroom interaction, school curriculum and the school and society. \r\n\r\nCourse aims: The course is designed to enable you to become a capable and confident teacher at secondary level. You will develop the ability to teach the National Curriculum, understanding how to make it relevant and accessible to everyone to promote learning. This will be developed alongside the skills and understanding required in order to meet the Teachers’ Standards.\r\n\r\nMode of study: This is a one-year full-time course (36 weeks) or 2 years part-time.\r\n\r\nCourse outline: The Computer Science course integrates theory with practice and two-thirds of your time will be spent in a school.\r\n\r\nThroughout the year you will be engaged in considering a range of subjects including:\r\nSubject knowledge enhancement \r\nUse of technology in the classroom\r\nLesson planning and assessment \r\nClassroom management\r\nResearch skills\r\nSpecial needs and inclusion\r\n\r\nSchool partnerships The University works closely in partnership with a number of schools. Two thirds of your time is spent in schools, where you will receive the support of school-based mentors who will be trained by the university, working with you on a day-to-day basis in the classroom.\r\n\r\nYou will spend an increasing amount of time in school as the course progresses, beginning in Term One with three days per week, Term Two, four days a week, Term Three, five days a week. The emphasis throughout will be on helping you to gain more confidence and competence in order to attain an increasing level of responsibility in the classroom.","interviewProcess":"We hold our interviews in Portsmouth and during yours, you'll need to demonstrate your knowledge and experience of your subject and the school system. We’ll send you an audit form to help you think about how your subject knowledge fits with the syllabus you want to teach, and how you might fill any gaps.\r\n \r\nYou’ll also be tested on reading and writing, take part in a group discussion, and will be asked to prepare a ‘microteaching’ lesson: ten minutes of teaching on a subject, skill or interest of your choice that you’ll deliver to your fellow applicants on the day.\r\nWe’ll be looking at all aspects of the application process – application form, academic reference, and the elements of the interview day – in order to get the fullest picture of you. We’re hoping to see that you’ve got the personal and intellectual qualities to be a teacher, and that you can meet the Teachers’ Standards by the end of your training.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"School-based work is an important part of our PGCE Programme and all of our partner schools have specially trained mentors who assist students in learning to teach. This mentoring programme is essential in the development of new teachers and will be a valuable asset in your training as you gain hands on experience of practising your new skill in actual classroom environments.
