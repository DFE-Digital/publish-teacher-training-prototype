It's a chance to show us your knowledge about the subject and your enthusiasm for the career. Being invited to a selection event doesn't mean you're guaranteed a place on the course - the point of the day is to help us come to a mutual decision.

It's very much a two-way process, where you can evaluate what we offer while we find out more about you.
