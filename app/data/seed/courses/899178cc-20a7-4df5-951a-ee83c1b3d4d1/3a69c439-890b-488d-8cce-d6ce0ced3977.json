It's very much a two-way process, where you can evaluate what we offer while we find out more about you. In order to help us explore your thinking and subject knowledge, and for you to decide if this is the right course for you, we have a number of activities we usually use as part of the interview process.\r\n\r\n[Find out more on our website] (https://www.shu.ac.uk/Study-here/options/Teach/Selection-events)","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"School-based training is an integral part of the course, and you will work with pupils in key stages 1 and 2.
