It's very much a two-way process, where you can evaluate what we offer while we find out more about you. In order to help us explore your thinking and subject knowledge, and for you to decide if this is the right course for you, we have a number of activities we usually use as part of the interview process.\r\n\r\n[Find out more on our website] (https://www.shu.ac.uk/visit-us/selection-events/selection-event-for-pgce-secondary-physical-education-1yr)","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"This course ensures that you'll have the real-life experience you need to enter teaching.
