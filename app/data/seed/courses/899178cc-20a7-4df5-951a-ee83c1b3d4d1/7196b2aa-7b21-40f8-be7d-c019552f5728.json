You can bring other forms of photo ID for the selection event, but if you do, you will still need to present valid identity documents required by the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) at your pre-course day.\r\n\r\nThe selection event is a process which assesses if you're suitable for a place on the course. It's a chance to show us your knowledge about the subject and your enthusiasm for the career. Being invited to a selection event doesn't mean you're guaranteed a place on the course - the point of the day is to help us come to a mutual decision. We need to decide whether to make you an offer and you need to decide whether you like the course and the university.\r\n\r\nWe aim to make the interview process as rigorous and informative as possible. It's very much a two-way process, where you can evaluate what we offer while we find out more about you. In order to help us explore your thinking and subject knowledge, and for you to decide if this is the right course for you, we have a number of activities we usually use as part of the interview process.\r\n\r\n[Find out more on our website] (https://www.shu.ac.uk/visit-us/selection-events/selection-event-for-pgce-primary-5-11-pe-specialist-with-qts)","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"During the course you develop your teaching skills and confidence during professional placements in at least two schools across the two key stages.
