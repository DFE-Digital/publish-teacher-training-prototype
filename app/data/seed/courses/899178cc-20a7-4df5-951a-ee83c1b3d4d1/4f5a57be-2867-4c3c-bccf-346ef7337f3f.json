You can bring other forms of photo ID for the selection event, but if you do, you will still need to present valid identity documents required by the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) at your pre-course day.\r\n\r\nThe selection event is a process which assesses if you're suitable for a place on the course. It's a chance to show us your knowledge about the subject and your enthusiasm for the career. Being invited to a selection event doesn't mean you're guaranteed a place on the course - the point of the day is to help us come to a mutual decision. We need to decide whether to make you an offer and you need to decide whether you like the course and the university.\r\n\r\nWe aim to make the interview process as rigorous and informative as possible. It's very much a two-way process, where you can evaluate what we offer while we find out more about you. In order to help us explore your thinking and subject knowledge, and for you to decide if this is the right course for you, we have a number of activities we usually use as part of the interview process.\r\n\r\n[Find out more on our website] (https://www.shu.ac.uk/visit-us/selection-events/selection-event-for-pgce-early-years-education-3-7-with-qts)","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Much of your development is built through your school-based training, linked by university-based learning. Your first experience is in Key Stage 1. It begins with 16 initial days followed by 7 week assessed placement.

In total you spend 120 days in school over the year.\r\n\r\nApply for a place through the School Direct scheme for a dedicated route into a job after graduation. When applying through School Direct, the school or partnership of schools that you've applied to will be much more involved in your selection, recruitment and professional development as there is the intention that you will be employed by them if you successfully complete the course.","personalQualities":"Candidates who are successful will demonstrate a sound understanding of teaching and how children learn, where possible within a school setting. We encourage all candidates to evidence their understanding by drawing on related examples or experiences, such as time spent in schools or other learning settings.
