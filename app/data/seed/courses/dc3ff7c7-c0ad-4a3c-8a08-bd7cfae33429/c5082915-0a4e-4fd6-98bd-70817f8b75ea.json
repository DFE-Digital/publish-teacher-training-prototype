Additional financial support may be available if you’re a parent or have a disability.\r\n\r\nRed Kite offers a monthly payment schedule for those planning to self-finance. For full time courses, this is £1,250 in October followed by 8 further monthly instalments of £1,000. For part time courses, for each year, an initial payment of £700 in October is due followed by 8 monthly instalments of £600.\r\n","aboutCourse":"This is a training programme designed especially for people with a passion for teaching in the 3-7 age range and the Early Years Foundation Stage and is structured in way that will give you the skills and experience most sought after by employers. \r\n\r\nThe course is multi-layered, involving: \r\n* Red Kite professional development days \r\n* School placements \r\n* University lectures \r\n* Twilight sessions \r\n* Conferences, tutorials and mini-placements focussed on Barriers to Learning, Special Educational Needs, Adult Mental Health, Behaviour, English as an Additional Language and Employment \r\n* Reading, research and reflections \r\n\r\nYou’ll start in school on the first day of term and see first-hand how teachers get to know and understand their pupils and the group dynamics of their classes. \r\n\r\nYou’ll also spend a full 24 weeks on your placements, meaning you get to properly immerse yourself in school life with both pupils and colleagues. \r\n\r\nYou’ll learn about the early learning goals in the seven areas of learning and development, with a particular focus on early language and extending vocabulary. Early Years teachers must ensure that children have a smooth transition to Key Stage 1 curriculum and know how to effectively teach systematic synthetic phonics.  \r\n\r\nThe professional development days are carefully sequenced in block weeks across the year and all sessions are led by inspirational teachers, both online and across the Red Kite partnership in six different training bases across Leeds and North Yorkshire. There are phase and subject specific sessions with a chance to pursue your own interests and specialise. \r\n\r\nYou then apply your learning in the classroom to practice and refine your teaching. You will be supported by fully trained mentors who will guide you to reflect upon your teaching and provide feedback that helps you to improve. \r\n\r\nRed Kite has an exclusive partnership with the University of Leeds and you’ll get to spend eight days during your training year working with the prestigious School of Education there, learning from some of the country’s leading educational researchers to gain your Post Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE). \r\n\r\nSome of the training days are face to face at the university and some are delivered online but all are specifically designed to give you all the knowledge and support you need to develop an evidence-based approach to teaching. \r\n\r\nArmed with this knowledge, you’ll complete four Primary assignments to gain 60 Masters credits.  ","interviewProcess":"Interviews are conducted on MS Teams by representatives from Red Kite Teacher Training and senior leaders from partnership schools. \r\n \r\nA plan for a pupil activity and a workload prioritisation activity will need to be prepared for the interview.\r\n\r\nYou will be given the opportunity to meet current trainees, course leaders and be offered a school experience day before or after your interview. \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Red Kite Teacher Training is one of the largest school-based providers of teacher training in North and West Yorkshire, with a partner network featuring urban and inner-city schools in places such as Harrogate, Bradford and Leeds, as well as schools in more rural parts of Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nThis ensures that travel needs can be accommodated and also that trainees can explore how their own personal skills and attributes suit different educational settings and challenges.\r\n\r\nAll trainees undertake two main placements – the first running from the Autumn term until December and the second, in a contrasting school environment, running from January until late June. These are supported by specially trained mentors and designated Early Career Leaders.\r\n\r\nThere is a comprehensive programme of professional development days, hosted by practicing teachers, that take place in local training venues across North, South, East and West Leeds, Harrogate, Skipton, Richmond and Northallerton. There are also mini placements spread across the year, which give trainees the opportunity to broaden their experience in a range of schools and contexts. \r\n\r\nThe main focus of the course is the in-school placement, which is where trainees spend the majority of their training year. Subject knowledge is supported by expert colleagues from across the partnership of schools as well as sessions delivered by the University and curriculum hubs in the region. These include the Computing hub, STEM learning hub, the English hub and the Maths Hub.","personalQualities":"\r\n* Passionate about making a difference to the lives and development of young people\r\n* Independent, resilient and adaptable\r\n* Friendly and approachable, with the ability to engage young people\r\n* Enthusiastic about their subject and are continuing to develop their subject knowledge\r\n* Creative and imaginative\r\n* Good organisational skills and excellent time management skills\r\n* Reflective and strive to improve their own practice\r\n* High standards of spoken and written English\r\n* Demonstrate a professional attitude\r\n* Have made a considered and informed decision to train to teach\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"Experience of being in a school and/or working with young people is not essential, however, it will be beneficial during the application process.
