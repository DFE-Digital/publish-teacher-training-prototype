In the last research assessment exercise, the department was rated second in the UK (REF, 2014). You will have the opportunity to work with experienced tutors who are actively engaged in research in their subject and in pedagogy more widely. 94% of 2018 graduates who sought teaching posts were employed within 6 months of qualifying. In our 2019 student survey, 92% of trainees rated the quality of their training as very good or good. \r\n\r\nThe special features of the PGCE science programmes at King’s are:\r\n\r\n - Separate groups for each of the four science specialisms: Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Physics with Mathematics. These focus on how to teach your specialist subject to the age range 11-18.\r\n - Sessions designed to help you teach science topics which are outside your science subject specialism. These are designed to help you contribute to science programmes at Key Stage 3 and 4.\r\n - 'Science Pedagogy' sessions where you work in mixed groups of science students on topics like scientific enquiry, formative assessment, use of discussion in science lessons and cognitive acceleration through science education. These classes are often taught by people who are at the forefront of research about innovative teaching strategies. The Science Education research group at King's is the largest in the UK and has a strong national and international reputation. This allows us to feed new ideas into the PGCE programme and creates a dynamic and forward-looking course. \r\n - The course is set in the context of a friendly department with a strong commitment to our students.\r\n","interviewProcess":"The selection process will  involve an interview, a group task and a short piece of writing.\r\n\r\nInterview/ group task\r\nIn interview and group task we will be looking for:\r\n\r\n - evidence that you have a commitment to working with young people;\r\n - ability to explain clearly and to think on your feet;\r\n - evidence of good interpersonal skills;\r\n - knowledge of school level science in each of biology, chemistry and physics;\r\n - familiarity with the realities of teaching science in secondary schools;\r\n - awareness of current educational issues;\r\n - commitment to equal opportunities;\r\n - ability to work well in a group dynamic.\r\n\r\nIn your writing we will be looking for:\r\n\r\n - ability to express yourself clearly;\r\n - accurate grammar and spelling\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will have two different school placements during the course.
