This programme is highly supportive of the realities of the modern classroom. \r\n\r\nThis course has been designed for those who would prefer a more hands-on approach to teacher training. You may have school experience as an instructor, cover supervisor, teaching assistant or overseas trained teacher.\r\n\r\nYou will spend the majority of your training working in a local school, where you will be employed as an unqualified teacher. You will be paid at least Point 1 on the unqualified teachers’ pay scale. You will normally be allocated approximately a 50% timetable of classes that you will teach from the first day of term. The timetable allocation will increase as you gain more experience. There is a comprehensive programme of mentoring, training and support delivered by the school and NELTA. You will complete a short placement (minimum 4 weeks) at a contrasting school to allow you to meaningfully experience teaching in another context. This is an 11-16 training programme although there will be pre and post phase experience as part of the training. There will be a three day primary school placement.\r\n\r\nAs well as the school-based support from your subject mentor there is also a team of dedicated tutors who will deliver training and fully support your school placement experience. You will have small group subject tutorials every Thursday afternoon followed by a facilitated teaching and learning workshop (with all trainees) from 4.15 to 5.15. There is also a programme of five ‘extended study days’ during the year which will focus on teacher training priorities such as behaviour for learning, SEND and EAL. All training sessions are held centrally at Beal High School in our bespoke NELTA training facility.\r\n\r\nThis course aims to prepare you to: \r\nBecome outstanding secondary school teachers \r\nBecome knowledgeable subject specialists who can support the leadership of curriculum development \r\nBecome good classroom managers \r\nBecome successful form tutors and collaborative colleagues. \r\n\r\nYou will be assessed through a combination of professional practice reports (written by your subject mentor), tutor visits to see you teach, two written assignments and a portfolio of evidence to demonstrate how you are meeting the Teachers’ Standards.\r\n","interviewProcess":"There is one interview which will be held at whichever school has identified itself as having a vacancy for a salaried trainee. You will be interviewed by representatives of the school (possibly Heads of Department or senior leadership) and a member of the NELTA team.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe interview process may include some or all of the following activities:\r\n \r\n* Subject knowledge activity (set before the day of the interview)\r\n* Delivery of a half hour teaching activity to students \r\n* Written task\r\n* Interview by panel \r\n\r\n\r\nWe do not give automatic feedback to all candidates rejected at interview. This is due to the large numbers of interviews that we carry out and the additional workload involved in feeding back to candidates. \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Most placements will be within our alliance of 14 secondary schools which includes community schools (maintained and academies), faith schools, boys and girls grammar schools and an independent school. The placement school itself will depend on which schools have identified themselves as willing to employ a salaried trainee. \r\n\r\nAll of our schools are geographically close, with most being within the London Borough of Redbridge which means that trainees can easily engage with more than one school in the partnership. \r\n\r\nThe age range of training is 11-16 although there is a requirement for pre and post phase experience as part of the training programme.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the time will be spent in the employing school with NELTA based training from 2.15 pm every Thursday. There are also five extended study days throughout the year. There is a requirement for a second placement in a contrasting school (minimum 4 weeks) and a three day primary school placement.\r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for ambitious trainee teachers who are passionate and enthusiastic about their subject and have a desire to share that with young people of all abilities in the secondary age range. You need to want to make a real difference to young people’s lives. You should be resilient, have the potential to be able to communicate with an audience and be able to develop positive professional relationships with young people and colleagues. We want you to be able to continually reflect on their practice and respond positively to feedback. The best teachers are learners themselves.","otherRequirements":"We have a duty to protect children and vulnerable adults, and so\r\nbackground checks will include an Enhanced Disclosure certificate from the DBS as a requirement of a place on the course.\r\n\r\nInitial Teacher Training providers are expected assess a trainee's English and mathematics knowledge before QTS is awarded. This will be done during the NELTA ITT programme. \r\n\r\nTeaching is physically and mentally demanding, and there are ‘fitness’ requirements set by the Department for Education for applicants to initial teacher training programmes. This does not however preclude disabled people from pursuing a programme of study or a career in teaching.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:26.258Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-04T11:22:56.987Z","canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","cycle":"2024","salaryDetails":"All trainees will be paid at least point one on the unqualified teachers' pay scale.
