In the last research assessment exercise, the department was rated second in the UK (REF, 2014). You will have the opportunity to work with experienced tutors who are actively engaged in research in their subject and in pedagogy more widely. 94% of 2018 graduates who sought teaching posts were employed within 6 months of qualifying. In our 2019 student survey, 92% of trainees rated the quality of their training as very good or good.\r\n\r\nThe PGCE Computing at King's trains Computing professionals and graduates to become effective teachers of Computing in secondary schools. The PGCE Computing programme examines in detail the specifications and expectations for Computing in UK secondary schools including GCSE and A-Level courses.\r\n\r\nLearning to be a teacher of Computing involves:\r\n\r\n-learning about teaching the Computing knowledge, skills and processes as laid down in the National Curriculum and examination specifications for Computing, Computer Science and Information Technology.\r\n-learning how to incorporate computational thinking into other subject areas in schools.\r\n\r\nA distinctive feature of the King's Computing programme is the emphasis on learning through critical reflection and discussion with colleagues. In the same way that you will encouraged to make your students think when they are analysing computing-based issues and problems, so staff at King's are keen for you to apply your developing understanding of teaching to help you think about your own practice.\r\n\r\nAt King’s we are at the forefront of research into computing education in schools, and this research impacts on the teaching in the programme. We also co-run the Computing At School (CAS) Regional Centre for London, running many professional development and networking events for teachers of Computing. Our PGCE students can get involved in all these activities.\r\n","interviewProcess":"In addition to meeting the shortlisting requirements, you must demonstrate the following if you are to be offered a place:\r\n\r\n-conceptual understanding of some school Computing\r\n-Computing knowledge of an appropriate level\r\n-ability to think and reason clearly\r\n-clarity and accuracy of written and spoken communication\r\n-successful experience with children or clear potential for this\r\n-ability to interact with pupils and colleagues\r\n-strong motivation to teach\r\n-ability to recognise own shortcomings\r\n-flexibility of mind and potential necessary to improve\r\n-ability to present ideas clearly and at an appropriate level\r\n\r\nIf you are shortlisted you will be invited to a group interview.
