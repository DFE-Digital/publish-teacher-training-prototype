They will support the trainee and organise additional training opportunities whilst on placement.\r\n- Each trainee will also be assigned an NWSCITT Subject Lead Tutor, who will provide them with subject specific training, advice and guidance.\r\n\r\n\r\nQTS Award: \r\n- To be awarded Qualified Teacher Status (QTS), trainees must evidence that they have met all of the Teachers' Standards by the end of the programme.  \r\n\r\nPGCE: \r\n- The Post Graduate Certificate of Education (PGCE) is accredited by Bath Spa University and successful completion will result in a PGCE with 60  Masters credits.  \r\n- Trainees will be required to pass all three PGCE assignments. \r\n- There will be three assignment launch lectures (held at either our Royal Wootton Bassett training centre or one of our partnership schools,) Q&A sessions and tutorials organised by Bath Spa University tutors. \r\n- There are no expectations for trainees to travel to Bath Spa University, as all resources are available online.  However, they will be registered as a student of the University and are welcome to use their facilities should they wish to do so. \r\n\r\nCovid-19\r\n- In the event of Covid-19 restrictions impacting on schools, we will monitor, re-evaluate and amend the training and delivery of the programme where necessary in response to guidance from the Government, Public Health England, DfE and NASBTT in order to protect pupils, staff and trainees, whilst continuing to offer a high quality programme.\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"- Interviews will be held at regular intervals starting in early November.\r\n\r\n- Due to Covid-19 restrictions, these interviews may take place virtually. \r\n  \r\nInterviews will consist of, but not limited to:\r\n- A small teaching task, \r\n- A self-reflection task,  \r\n- A subject knowledge interview\r\n- A formal interview with senior staff and subject leaders.  \r\n\r\n- You will be expected to present original qualification and identification for verification at interview.

Eventually, trainees will take on responsibility for entire classes, lesson planning and lesson sequencing.\r\n- Trainees can expect to begin by following a 40% teaching timetable, gradually increasing to 70%-80% by the end of the year.  By this point trainees should have developed high level teaching skills.\r\n- Please expect to work full days during your course. It is also highly likely that you will be working outside of normal working hours at home.\r\n-Please expect subject and central training days to run from 09.00am-4.00pm, subject to variation.\r\n\r\nCovid-19:\r\n- In the event of Covid-19 restrictions continuing to have an impact on schools, we will monitor, revaluate and amend our programme where necessary in response to guidance from the Government, Public Health England, DfE and NASBTT.
