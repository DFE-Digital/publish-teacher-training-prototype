You will be assigned both a Mentor from your subject area and a Professional Mentor who has responsibility for all trainees in that school, to support and guide you through your training year. You will be introduced to the practice of teaching in a structured way, building up your teaching experience and timetable at a pace that matches your readiness.\r\n\r\nYou will also have a second school placement, typically six weeks, a three day primary placement and a two day KS5 placement which give you the opportunity to extend your practice in different settings.\r\n\r\nWeekly Professional Studies training is held every Monday at either Weydon School, Farnham or Reigate School, Reigate. In these sessions you will receive practical strategies and ideas to develop your practice within the classroom, and be able to reflect on your school experience.  These sessions will immerse you in a rich and stimulating professional learning environment. The programme is front loaded in the first half term - you will attend sessions on a Friday as well. There will be no sessions during the latter part of the summer term in order to give you experience of ‘block’ teaching time when your timetable is at its fullest.\r\n\r\nMusic Subject Studies training complements and reinforces the themes addressed in Professional Studies and is led by subject experts chosen for their renowned reputation as skilled trainers and outstanding practitioners.  This weekly dedicated session focusses on subject related topics, providing you with the appropriate pedagogical knowledge to prepare you to teach Music to a high level within the classroom.\r\n\r\nThe i2i Music SCITT programme is designed to support you to achieve both Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and PGCE. The PGCE element of the course is delivered and accredited by the University of Sussex (whose ITT provision has been graded as outstanding by Ofsted) via regular sessions throughout the year. Trainees are welcome to go to the University to access the library and any keynote lectures if they so wish.  All these materials are also available remotely through the University of Sussex website for those Trainees who do not wish to visit the university in person.  \r\n\r\n[For further information please click here to visit the i2i website] (http://www.i2ipartnership.co.uk/112/the-programme)\r\n","interviewProcess":"Once we receive your application through UCAS we will invite you to attend an interview within approximately one week. The interview itself will be held at the Lead School (Weydon) and is of half a day's duration. \r\n\r\nThe interview will consist of: \r\n\r\n*  A tour of the school \r\n*  A subject knowledge test. This is usually part of a GCSE paper and will last no longer than 30 minutes\r\n* A Maths and English Test\r\n* Teaching an advised topic to a small group of children for 20 minutes\r\n* A panel interview with the Director of SCITT and a Music subject expert\r\n\r\nYou will be sent interview details in advance so you have plenty of time for preparation. We aim to make your interview as welcoming, enjoyable and informative as possible, enabling you to perform at your best and to gain the knowledge you need to accept a place if offered. Decisions about the offer are made very soon after the interview and the outcomes communicated through both the SCITT and UCAS. Unsuccessful candidates are offered feedback on their performance.\r\n\r\n[Click here to visit the i2i website for more information](http://www.i2ipartnership.co.uk/93/teacher-training-faq#interview)\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The i2i partnership consists of [21 highly successful secondary schools](http://www.i2ipartnership.co.uk/27/i2i-partnership-schools) around Surrey, Hampshire, Berkshire and Middlesex, all committed to providing, outstanding teacher training and all experienced in delivering and leading initial teacher training.\r\n\r\nAll our schools are committed to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children and young children and safer recruitment procedures are followed by the i2i SCITT Partnership. We expect all staff and trainees to share responsibility for this.\r\n\r\nPlacing Trainees is a complex process and we take many factors into consideration when doing so. These factors include:\r\n* Establishing which schools in the partnership have the capacity to host a Trainee in a particular subject\r\n* Selecting a Mentor who will be the best fit for the Trainee\r\n* Establishing at interview where the candidate will be living for the course, if the candidate drives and if they have access to a car or if they will be dependent on public transport.\r\n\r\nWe do not expect Trainees to travel for longer than an hour each way to their placement school. Trainee journeys to their placement schools are typically between 20 - 40 minutes and we always do our best to accommodate Trainees’ personal circumstances when placing them.\r\n\r\nWe do offer a limited amount of accomodation to rent adjacent to Weydon School within a four bedroom detached house on a fixed one-year tenancy.\r\n\r\nTrainees will spend the first term in their main placement school. After Christmas, Trainees will be given a six-week contrasting second placement until the February half term, after which they will return to their main placement school.\r\n\r\nAll of our Initial Teacher Training courses teach the age range 11-16 so every Trainee will get an exposure to teaching Key Stages 3 and 4.  \r\n\r\nTrainees will also do short KS2 and KS5 placement at a primary school (three days) and Sixth Form (two days).  \r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"If you are enthusiastic and determined, and aspire to become an excellent teacher then we would love to hear from you. We look for the following personal qualities:\r\n\r\n• A friendly and approachable nature\r\n• Excellent interpersonal skills\r\n• Organisation and time management skills\r\n• A passion for your subject\r\n• An innate ability to communicate and relate to young people\r\n• A positive outlook and resilient nature\r\n• A creative and innovative approach\r\n• The ability to reflect on and improve practice\r\n• Potential leadership capabilities\r\n• A passion and drive for delivering first class education.\r\n","otherRequirements":"All Trainees are required to undergo an enhanced DBS check to verify  suitability for working with young people. If you have lived overseas for more than 12 months in the past 10 years, you will need to provide an overseas police check. \r\n\r\nAll Trainees will be required to complete a Fitness to Teach on-line health questionnaire to ensure they are well enough for the rigors of the teaching profession. \r\n\r\nPrior to the start of the course, all Trainees are required to pass the Government Literacy and Numeracy skills tests for teaching.\r\n\r\n","status":2,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:50:24.493Z","canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","cycle":"2023","salaryDetails":"The salary will be specific to your placement school, more information on this will be discussed if a salaried place is offered."}
