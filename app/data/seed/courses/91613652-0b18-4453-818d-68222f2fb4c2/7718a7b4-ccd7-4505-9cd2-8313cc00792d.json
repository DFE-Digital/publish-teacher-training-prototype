This includes training in all curriculum areas and additional training on safeguarding, SEND, EAL, Children Looked After, writing PSP’s, memory training and behaviour management. All training is evaluated by trainees and the training programme is reviewed annually using results from this feedback.\r\n\r\nThe course is a full-time, one-year training programme, structured around the school year. Trainees will be based in our schools and be regarded as a member of the team from the start.\r\n\r\nAt the start of the Autumn term, trainees will be assigned to a EYFS class within one of our schools. For the first few weeks they will spend their time working with small groups of children or team teaching, leading onto teaching whole lessons.\r\n\r\nAlongside time on placement, trainees will follow a structured programme of pedagogical and subject knowledge training with both WCPSD training and Liverpool Hope University. This allows trainees to apply and develop their new-found knowledge and skills immediately in the classroom environment. During the latter part of the autumn term trainees will undertake their first, assessed teaching practice.\r\n \r\nThe Spring and Summer terms follow a similar pattern, with weekly training input from WCPSD/ Liverpool Hope University followed by an assessed teaching practice.\r\n\r\nTrainees will move to a second school within the partnership for the Spring term within a KS1 setting and depending upon  training needs and preferences, will either return to the original school or move to a third school for the summer term.\r\n\r\nTrainees will experience both EYFS and KS1. Trainees academic study with Liverpool Hope University is spread over the year, commencing with an initial induction day in September.","interviewProcess":"We have a rigourous structure for the recruitement of trainees.
