We are committed to creative approaches to teaching science, and you will be encouraged to develop resources during the programme. The experienced tutors have previously been classroom teachers and heads of school science departments, and have worked in industry. They are actively involved in science education research, work on national curriculum development, and lead sessions for Science Learning Centre London. \r\n\r\nYou will acquire a critical understanding of current debates and issues relating to science education and, particularly biology, and we will guide and support you in developing your subject knowledge. You are expected to engage with reading and research in science education and to regularly reflect upon your own progress. \r\n\r\nThe PGCE course covers health and safety, management of teaching and learning in laboratories and outdoors, the use of ICT, facilitating small group discussion, meeting pupils' special needs, and assessment. The facilities include a suite of laboratories and a micro-computing laboratory. You will also have the opportunity to teach outside the classroom in a variety of London venues such as Kew Gardens. \r\n\r\nFor further information [click here](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/courses/teacher-training/biology-pgce)\r\n","interviewProcess":"We operate a two stage process on our UCL programmes.\r\n\r\nCoombe Girls' School, as the lead school in the partnership, will co-ordinate the recruitment process. The UCL IOE will carry out all the necessary academic eligibility checks. \r\n\r\nFollowing successful shortlisting, the first stage will involve you spending a day in school, up to twenty five working days after we receive your application. This may include an individual interview, teaching part of a lesson, a subject knowledge assessment and a written task. This will also be an opportunity for you to learn about the training programme and partnership, see the school and talk to some staff and pupils. The process will be rigorous and will enable us to assess your potential for the teaching profession and to identify strengths and weaknesses for you to begin to address. \r\n\r\nIf you are successful at the school interview, our university partner will also invite you to an interview day at the UCL Institute of Education. This day will also serve as an opportunity to learn more about the PGCE course, the tutors and the facilities at the Institute. ","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Once you have been accepted onto the programme, your placement schools will be allocated from the pool of schools offering your subject.  \r\nThis process is not normally finalised until late June, by when our schools will have fixed their staffing for September.\r\n\r\nYou will have two consecutive placements of roughly equal length - something which we consider a real strength of our programme, as it means that you will gain a deep understanding of both schools, their challenges, approaches and contexts.  We aim to give you two contrasting settings, in order for you to experience this variety.  Schools will give you a balance of year groups and abilities and, where possible, arrange for you to teach KS5, but this is not always manageable in both placement schools.\r\n\r\nPlacement one will run from October to January and placement two will run from February to May.\r\n\r\nYou may express a preference of school, which we will consider when drawing up the placements - but we cannot guarantee it.  We aim to keep your travel time to a maximum of one hour, although in most cases travel time is much less.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning you will be treated as a member of staff, welcomed into your subject department and invited to attend staff meetings, development days, staff social activities and relevant educational trips.\r\n\r\nEach trainee will have a dedicated mentor in their placement school, who will guide you and work alongside you to identify needs and provide personalised support as you develop. Our mentors are outstanding teachers who are required to undertake a rigorous training programme to develop their coaching, effective classroom observation and feedback skills. They will work with you to develop rigour, professional knowledge, understanding and skills in order to deliver creative, purposeful and challenging teaching and learning. \r\n\r\nYou will gradually build up your contact time with students as you develop your confidence, teaching skills and time management. \r\n\r\nYou will be assigned to a tutor group, in order to regularly shadow a tutor and support all-important pastoral work. ","personalQualities":"We are looking for ambitious trainee teachers who are passionate and enthusiastic about their subject, with a real desire to share this with young people of all abilities, needs and backgrounds at secondary level. \r\n\r\nWe expect you to have a good basic knowledge of biology, chemistry and physics, and be willing to learn more.  We normally expect you to have an A level in biology and one other science subject at minimum grade D, or the equivalent. Candidates without these qualifications may be accepted if they have acquired knowledge through other routes (e.g. work experience).\r\n","otherRequirements":"You must have good practical skills and technical know-how, particularly in biology-related practical work. \r\n\r\nYou will ideally have some experience of working with young people, perhaps through volunteer work, young clubs, sports teams or charities. \r\n\r\nWe recommend that you gain some experience in a classroom prior to interview.\r\n\r\nAll places on the PGCE are subject to satisfactory health and criminal convictions assessments. Applicants will be required to complete an enhanced Criminal Records Bureau Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check. We expect you to share our commitment to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children, young people and vulnerable adults.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:53:44.755Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-04T11:18:05.564Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2024"}
