The course sets out to give you a sense of the place of history in a multicultural society. It also equips you to teach across secondary and to foster learning across the wide spectrum of abilities found in local schools. You will enter into the lively debates surrounding history teaching and the place of history in the whole school curriculum, including historyâ€™s contribution to literacy and citizenship.\r\n\r\nThe course is an active and demanding combination of teaching and learning methods, including simulations of classroom activities, individual tutorials and group sessions. You are encouraged to share your own expertise and experience. We take advantage of developments in e learning to stay in touch during placements, to encourage collaborative and creative teaching, and to promote reflective and effective practice. Written assignments give you the opportunity to explore the most recent developments in research into teaching and learning, while building upon your grounding in history at undergraduate or master's level.\r\n\r\nHistory Subject Studies will take place throughout the year on Wednesdays - at university, in a partner institution or site of educational interest.  On some Wednesdays you will focus on Professional Studies (more generic aspects of teaching and learning) with student teachers from other specialisms.  This will take the form of lectures, seminars, workshops or research. \r\n\r\nFor further information [click here](https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/postgraduate-courses/pgce-secondary/pgce-secondary-history-specialism/)\r\n","interviewProcess":"We operate a one stage process on our Roehampton programmes.\r\n\r\nCoombe Girls' School, as the lead school in the partnership, will co-ordinate the recruitment process. The University of Roehampton will carry out all the necessary academic eligibility checks. \r\n\r\nFollowing successful shortlisting, you will be invited for an assessment day in school, up to twenty five working days after we receive your application. This may include an individual interview, a presentation task, leading part of a lesson, a subject knowledge assessment and a written task. This will also be an opportunity for you to learn about the training programme and partnership, see the school and talk to some staff and pupils. The process will be rigorous and will enable us to assess your potential for the teaching profession and to identify strengths and weaknesses for you to begin to address. \r\n\r\nIf you are successful at the school interview, our university partner will carry out a paper scrutiny of your application and may invite you to an interview day to clarify certain points and give you an opportunity to learn more about the PGCE course, the tutors and the facilities at the university. ","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Once you have been accepted onto the programme, your placement schools will be allocated from the pool of schools offering your subject.  \r\nThis process is not normally finalised until late June, by when our schools will have fixed their staffing for September.\r\n\r\nYou will have two consecutive school placements (the A-B model).  The first lasts three months and the second lasts five months, meaning you will gain a deep understanding of both schools, their challenges, approaches and contexts.  We aim to give you two contrasting settings, in order for you to experience this variety.  Schools will give you a balance of year groups and abilities and, where possible, arrange for you to teach KS5, but this is not always manageable in both placement schools.\r\n\r\nPlacement one runs from late September to mid-December and placement two runs from January to the start of June.  During this placement time, you spend four days a week in school (not Wednesdays).  \r\n\r\nYou may express a preference of school, which we will consider when drawing up the placements - but we cannot guarantee it.  We aim to keep your travel time to a maximum of one hour, although in most cases travel time is much less.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning you will be treated as a member of staff, welcomed into your subject department and invited to attend staff meetings, development days, staff social activities and relevant educational trips.\r\n\r\nEach trainee will have a dedicated mentor in their placement school, who will guide you and work alongside you to identify needs and provide personalised support as you develop. Our mentors are outstanding teachers who are required to undertake a rigorous training programme to develop their coaching, effective classroom observation and feedback skills. They will work with you to develop rigour, professional knowledge, understanding and skills in order to deliver creative, purposeful and challenging teaching and learning. \r\n\r\nYou will gradually build up your contact time with students as you develop your confidence, teaching skills and time management. \r\n\r\nYou will be assigned to a tutor group, in order to regularly shadow a tutor and support all-important pastoral work. ","personalQualities":"We are looking for ambitious trainee teachers who are passionate and enthusiastic about their subject, with a real desire and ability to communicate this with young people of all abilities, needs and backgrounds at secondary level. \r\n\r\nWe expect you to be confident in the use of information and communications technology (ICT), and be willing to extend your abilities in the use and application of technology in your teaching. \r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"You will ideally have some experience of working with young people, perhaps through volunteer work, young clubs, sports teams or charities. \r\n\r\nWe strongly recommend that you gain some experience in a classroom prior to interview.\r\n\r\nAll places on the PGCE are subject to satisfactory health and criminal convictions assessments. Applicants will be required to complete an enhanced Criminal Records Bureau Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check.  We expect you to share our commitment to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children, young people and vulnerable adults.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:53:45.808Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-04T10:49:13.815Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2023"}
