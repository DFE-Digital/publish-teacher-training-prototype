The partnership works together to develop outstanding student teachers who are transformative and creative professionals, highly motivated and committed, autonomous and independent, enquiry-based practitioners and self-reflective practitioners. Historically, a significant number of our trainees secure teaching posts within Ebor Hope and Ebor Academy Trust schools.\r\n\r\nThe programme delivers contemporary and highly relevant education and training which provides excellent opportunities for you to develop knowledge and understanding of primary education and wider educational issues.  You will be equipped to become an outstanding teacher and leader with strong subject knowledge and a clear professional identity.  You will be supported by experts in both university and schools to ensure that you have opportunities to learn about current classroom practice and develop deep subject pedagogy.  The programme combines school experience with taught sessions on subject knowledge and pedagogy which occur at university and also in partnership schools. Two academic assignments will need to be passed so you meet the programme aims and gain the PGCE award.  These modules will underpin your own rigorous understanding of pedagogy and will provide you with 60 Masters level credits, which you may wish to use towards a full Masters qualification in the future.\r\n\r\nThe Ebor Hope Teaching Schools Alliance PGCE School Direct programme is a full time programme studied within one academic year (September - June) and covers either the 3- 7 or 7-11 age phase.

The programme encourages you to engage critically with educational issues to enable you to develop as a reflective practitioner, with the ability to evaluate and adapt your practice to meet the diverse needs of pupils in primary schools.  This is achieved through a range of learning, teaching and assessment strategies, including active learning and enquiry-based learning, which is considered essential in both modelling effective learning and teaching practice.\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"The recruitment process is rigorous and thorough.
