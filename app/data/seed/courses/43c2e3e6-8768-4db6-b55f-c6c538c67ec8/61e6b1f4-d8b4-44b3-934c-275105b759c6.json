Trainees will be given the opportunity to work in modern, well-equipped classrooms in one of the largest 11-19 secondary schools in the UK, located just five minutes from Junction 28 of the M1. \r\n\r\nThroughout the training year, trainees will be supported by their subject-based mentor, the School Direct Leader and by a wide range of experienced TLR holders who will deliver regular training sessions throughout the year. The School Direct course will enable trainees to gain QTS status, a PGDE qualification and MA credits awarded by the University of Sheffield on successful completion. \r\n\r\nWorking with our partner schools across the Two Counties’ Trust, Ashfield School ITT provide training placements in a variety of contexts, preparing graduates for a successful future in teaching. Furthermore, we will support trainees in the professional recruitment process should a suitable vacancy arise at Ashfield School or one of our partner schools.\r\n\r\nWe hope that you will choose to start your teaching career with Ashfield School ITT and help deliver an outstanding education for the benefit of the students in our care.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Once we receive your UCAS application we will consider a number of factors in making our decision about whether to interview you:\r\n\r\n* Do you demonstrate a clear interest in becoming a teacher?\r\n* Do you have strong references that suggest you have the capacity to train to be a teacher?\r\n* Do you have highly developed subject knowledge, or an awareness that you need to develop this?\r\n* Have you written a strong personal statement, demonstrating your commitment to teaching, your passion for your subject and an understanding of the realities of the profession?\r\n\r\nDepending on your subject, your selection day will take place either at the University or in a partner school, and will consist of the following elements:\r\n\r\n* Introduction to the course\r\n* A task designed to ensure that your subject knowledge is strong\r\n* A chance to interact with other candidates or with pupils, and to reflect on this experience\r\n* A written task\r\n* A formal interview, carried out by a university tutor and a school representative\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"\r\nYou will undertake four periods of school experience:\r\n\r\n* One week in a primary school early in the programme\r\n* A 7 week placement between October and December\r\n* A 14 week placement between February and June in a partner school\r\n* A 2-week enrichment/enhancement placement in June\r\n\r\nIn all curriculum areas you will also have the chance to visit a number of schools as a part of the University-centred parts of the PGDE.

This range of inner-city, suburban and rural contexts provides rich opportunities for diverse and balanced experiences in schools, and we work hard to secure you two contrasting placements.\r\n\r\nWhen tutors are arranging placements, personal circumstances such as child-care and additional needs are taken into account as much as possible.\r\n\r\nFurther information about school placements can be found [here](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/education/pgde). \r\n\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"\r\nWe consider six key elements when selecting students for our PGDE programme:\r\n\r\n* Commitment to teaching\r\n* Insight into the realities of teaching\r\n* Resilience\r\n* An analytical approach to problem solving\r\n* Enthusiasm for your subject\r\n* Interpersonal and communication skills\r\n\r\nWe will consider your strengths in each area during the selection process, including when considering your application form.\r\n","otherRequirements":"As this course leads to a professional qualification, student teachers will be required to undertake a DBS Enhanced Disclosure and Work Health Assessment.
