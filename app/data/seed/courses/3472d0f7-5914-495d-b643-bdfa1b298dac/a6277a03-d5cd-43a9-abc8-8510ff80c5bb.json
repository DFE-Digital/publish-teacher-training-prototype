The eQ training approach includes core face to face days, subject specific and pedagogy blended learning resources, learning tasks and theory papers. Start dates are flexible as we have rolling recruitment and a cycle of training days starts each term for the group of full-time trainees starting then.\r\nOur curriculum has a shared vision, is well sequenced and cohesively integrated in schools that prepares trainees for the reality of the classroom through sustainable workload and support. Mastery of the eQ ITT curriculum is at the heart, sequentially supporting trainee development through ‘learning that’ and’ learning how to’ across the core areas of behaviour management, classroom practice and adaptive teaching, subject knowledge and pedagogy, curriculum, assessment and professional behaviours.  e-Qualitas has a comprehensive range of best practice research-based learning resources that come together as a coherent high-quality training offer for our trainees. \r\n\r\neQ recognises that all training situations are different, and we tailor aspects of the learning journey towards mastery of the eQ curriculum and the Teachers’ Standards training accordingly. Each trainee, in his or her school, is in a unique position, learning how to plan so that all pupils and students in their context, make good progress in lessons and over time. \r\n\r\nOur trainees spend most of their time in school. They move from co-teaching with experienced staff to independent teaching (with support and advice from other teachers). Most trainees are teaching about a 50% timetable by a third of the way through their course, rising to 60% in the middle term, and rising again in the final term. A 6-week placement in a contrasting school usually takes place in the middle of the training period. Trainees typically attend about 10 training days plus phase/ subject specialist days in the centre (currently central London, near Fenchurch Street). Some of these days are likely to be offered as blended virtual learning days going forward.  There is a comprehensive VLE to support independent study, and pro-forma that can be used for lesson planning, observations, and to structure evaluative writing etc. A tutor from e-Qualitas visits for a whole day each half term. \r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"We will invite selected candidates to an interview.
