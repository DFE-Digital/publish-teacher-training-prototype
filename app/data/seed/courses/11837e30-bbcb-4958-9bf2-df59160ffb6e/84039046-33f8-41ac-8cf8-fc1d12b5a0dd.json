You will spend 85% of your time in one of our partner schools, with the other 15% spent attending training sessions facilitated by SLE’s or university tutors.  Upon successful completion of the program, you will be awarded QTS and a PGCE.\r\nYou will be primarily based at your ‘home’ school, but will be expected to attend to attend training sessions at various local venues.\r\nLFSP offer two School Direct Primary ITT routes – salaried and non-salaried.  On the salaried route you are employed by your ‘home’ school and paid on the UQT Scale point 1.  Trainees on the salaried route are expected to be able to potentially undertake a higher teaching commitment, with the possibility that they may be given their own class responsibility from the beginning of the program.  The salaried route is generally best suited to those trainees that have broad experience within a school setting.  On the salaried route the tuition-fee is payable by the trainee; on the non-salaried route it is the responsibility of the trainee to pay the tuition-fee, but subject to eligibility they could access Student Finance if they so wished. \r\n","interviewProcess":"Subject to eligibility checks, you will be invited to attend an interview via UCAS, as well as email invitation from a member of the LFSP team.  At your interview, the panel will be a group of SLE’s from our teaching schools and partner schools.  There will be a formal interview, and you will also be required to deliver a teaching task. Prior to the interview, you will be made aware of which year group you will deliver your teaching task to.  A decision as to whether or not you will be offered a place on this program will be made, and you will be informed of this decision via UCAS.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"All school placements are arranged and organised by LFSP, and you will spend time in at least 2 contrasting schools, as well as gaining additional EAL and SEND exposure.  Whilst consideration is taken with regards to the location of your placement school/s in relation to your home address, trainees should anticipate that they could possibly have to travel up to 1 hour to reach their placement school.  The average travel time to a placement school is 10-30 minutes.\r\n\r\nYou’ll have the support of mentors in schools who will help you to develop your practice through observations, planning meetings, weekly tutorials, reports and in-depth lesson evaluations.\r\n\r\nYour university tutor will visit you in school to guide, support and evaluate your progress. There is an emphasis on practical engagement with the curriculum whilst developing your understanding of the theoretical perspectives which underpin the best models of classroom practice.\r\n","personalQualities":"\r\n* High level of motivation\r\n* Strong work ethic\r\n* Potential to become an effective classroom leader\r\n* Good communicator and listener\r\n* Patience, adaptability, resilience, team-work, imagination\r\n* Positive expectations\r\n* Be organized, and have great time management\r\n\r\nLet us know why you want to teach, and provide evidence that you understand the rewards and challenges of teaching.  Previous experience is not compulsory, but if you do have relevant work/voluntary experience, please include this on your application.  Tell us about the range of relevant abilities and skills you can bring to teaching.\r\n","otherRequirements":"Satisfactory enhanced DBS clearance","status":2,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:46:53.355Z","canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","cycle":"2023","salaryDetails":"\r\n* UQT Scale point 1\r\n\r\n* The tuition-fees for LFSP School Direct salaried routes are payable by the trainee\r\n\r\n*Where a candidate applies for the salaried route and doesn't currently have a supporting school in mind, any interview offered will primarily be for a position on the Tuition-Fee (i.e. non-salaried) route.  If at interview, the panel deem you potentially suitable for the salaried route, we would then look to secure a second interview with a prospective sponsor school (subject to vacancies and availability)"}
