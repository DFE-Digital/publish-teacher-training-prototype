Our training programme covers the effective teaching of all National Curriculum subjects, development of generic teaching skills such as behaviour for effective learning, assessment, pupil wellbeing and other current educational issues. Trainees attend a pre-course induction day with their host school mentor in July and a second induction day prior to taking up their main placement. The course is structured so that trainees gain hands on experience in their host schools from the very beginning. Trainees spend approximately three days a week in school and two days a week on our taught course for the first 2 terms. During this time there are also opportunities to visit other partnership schools to further develop practice. In the final term there are two block teaching practices, one in a second placement school and a final assessed teaching practice back in the main placement school. Trainees are allocated to one of our 2 cohorts with training days based either at Lyons Hall Primary School in Braintree or Newlands Spring Primary School in Chelmsford depending on where you live. Some training days are also held in other partnership schools.\r\n\r\nEach trainee is assigned a mentor in each school and an external mentor who support and guide them through their professional development. Throughout the year trainees complete directed tasks and 3 written assignments which build up a range of evidence against the Teachers’ Standards for their Professional Portfolio which is a core requirement for the successful completion of the course.","interviewProcess":"Short listed candidates will be invited to interview at one of our partnership schools. The interview panel will consist of programme leaders, head teachers or members of our external mentor team. As well as the interview candidates will deliver a short pre-prepared presentation; carry out a written task; a class based task and a maths task.\r\n\r\nInterviews will take place either for the whole morning or the whole afternoon and will last approximately 3.5 to 4 hours in total- the start times vary between schools.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Every trainee undertaking teacher training must teach in at least 2 different schools or settings. Our primary trainees begin their main school placement in their preferred key stage from the first day of the new school year. Candidates are asked at interview their preference of key stage for their main placement and may chose EYFS, KS1, lower KS2 and upper KS2. Trainees undertake a 6 week placement in their second contrasting school with a different age range. Trainees also have the opportunity to visit and learn from a range of different partnership schools throughout the programme. Trainees attend 60 (65 for those in EYFS) course days either in Braintree or Chelmsford with the other days in school.\r\n\r\nWe have partnership schools (over 50) across Essex from small rural to large multi-form entry primaries, including church schools. Our largest number of partnership schools are in Chelmsford and Braintree but we also have schools in Colchester, Clacton, Harlow, Southwoodham Ferrers, Clacton, Coggeshall, Witham, Earls Colne, Halstead, West Bergholt.\r\n\r\nEach school is unique and we take care to match trainees to schools that are suited to their individual needs and that are within a reasonable travelling distance.","personalQualities":"We are looking for applications from those with a passion and enthusiasm for working with children and ensuring the best outcomes for them. Candidates should be good communicators with a willingness to learn and potential to become engaging, reflective practitioners. It is helpful for candidates to have some experience of working or volunteering in schools to develop their understanding of the role of a teacher and to affirm that they are making the right career choice.","otherRequirements":"All successful candidates who go on to accept a place will be required to have a clear DBS check.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:48:53.613Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-29T13:34:06.501Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2024"}
