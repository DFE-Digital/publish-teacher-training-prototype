Our training programme covers the effective teaching of all National Curriculum subjects, development of generic teaching skills such as behaviour for effective learning, assessment, pupil wellbeing and other current educational issues. Trainees attend a pre-course induction day with their host school mentor in July and a second induction day prior to taking up their main placement. The course is structured so that trainees gain hands on experience in their host schools from the very beginning. Trainees spend approximately three days a week in school and two days a week on our taught course for the first 2 terms. During this time there are also opportunities to visit other partnership schools to further develop practice. In the final term there are two block teaching practices, one in a second placement school and a final assessed teaching practice back in the main placement school. Trainees are allocated to one of our 2 cohorts with training days based either at Lyons Hall Primary School in Braintree or Newlands Spring Primary School in Chelmsford depending on where you live. Some training days are also held in other partnership schools.\r\n\r\nEach trainee is assigned a mentor in each school and an external mentor who support and guide them through their professional development. Throughout the year trainees complete directed tasks and 3 written assignments which build up a range of evidence against the Teachers’ Standards for their Professional Portfolio which is a core requirement for the successful completion of the course.","interviewProcess":"Short listed candidates will be invited to interview at one of our partnership schools.
