You’ll develop your subject specialist knowledge alongside hands-on classroom experience. Successful completion of your PGCE course prepares you to start your first teaching post within a secondary school setting. Our course is designed to prepare you to teach pupils in the 11-16 age range.\r\n\r\nThe course programme is divided into two main themes:\r\n\r\n* Developing Specialist Subject Knowledge\r\n\r\nSubject sessions provide you with an understanding of subject pedagogy in Chemistry and generic Science sessions offer you the opportunity to explore a wide range of issues such as 'practical aspects of Science', assessment of Science and literacy in Science as well as the more practical considerations whilst teaching this subject. We help you to prepare for teaching all the sciences at Key Stage 3. \r\n\r\n* Supporting Learning and Progress in the Secondary School\r\n\r\nWe’ll prepare you for the classroom, allowing you to develop your teaching skills and understanding of how to meet the needs of all learners. Themes include how young people learn, teaching and learning techniques to support pupils’ progress; behaviour management, assessment, inclusive, creative and innovative teaching methods and how to plan lessons and sequences of lessons. You will research evidence based learning theories, gain a greater understanding of current professional issues in secondary schools and begin to develop your own educational philosophy.\r\n\r\nYou’ll learn in small, friendly and supportive groups, designed to give you the confidence to succeed. Course tutors are experienced teachers and you’ll have a personal academic tutor to support you through your studies. Teaching is through workshops, tutorials and lectures, some with guest speakers, and through group work with other trainee teachers.\r\n\r\nTwo of the PGCE modules are at Master’s level and you’ll have the opportunity to continue your studies further to complete a Master’s degree, supporting your early professional development.\r\n\r\nAssessment is typically through the completion of a range of classroom activities, written assignments, reports, personal subject audits and the development of portfolios of evidence. There are no formal examinations and the assignments are carefully designed to help you to develop your teaching practice further. Upon successful completion of the programme we recommend Qualified Teaching Status be awarded by the Department for Education.","interviewProcess":"You will be shortlisted for interview based on your application. The interview process typically lasts for half a day. The following selection procedures are designed to assess your suitability to train to teach:\r\n\r\n* You will be asked to teach a concept from your subject area\r\n* You will participate in a group task which is designed to investigate your understanding of teaching and learning and the role of a secondary school teacher\r\n* Complete tasks designed to evaluate your fundamental English and Mathematics skills\r\n* You will also have an individual interview with a member of the course team which will include a discussion about your subject knowledge","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"For all trainees, their school based training is the central element of their initial teacher education. You will undertake at least two compulsory placements as part of your course and will spend 120 days in at least two schools. You’ll benefit from being able to observe experienced teachers, from practical hands-on experience and from supportive mentoring to help you to develop into a confident and successful teacher.\r\n\r\nYou’ll experience the wider role of a teacher in secondary education. You’ll have the support of both subject and professional mentors in schools who will help you to develop your practice through observations, planning meetings, weekly tutorials, reports and in-depth lesson evaluations.  \r\n\r\nYour university tutor will visit you in school to guide, support and evaluate your progress. There is an emphasis on practical engagement with the curriculum whilst developing your understanding of the theoretical perspectives which underpin the best models of practice.","personalQualities":"You must demonstrate the ability to communicate effectively, and that you have the intellectual and academic capabilities to meet the required Teachers' Standards by the end of the programme. \r\n","otherRequirements":"* Offers will be subject to satisfactory Disclosure and Barring Service enhanced disclosure check and trainees must not previously have been barred from teaching or working with children.
