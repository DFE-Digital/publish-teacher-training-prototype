You’ll develop your subject specialist knowledge alongside hands-on classroom experience. Successful completion of your PGCE course prepares you to start your first teaching post within a secondary school setting. Our course is designed to prepare you to teach pupils in the 11-16 age range.\r\n\r\nThe course programme is divided into two main themes:\r\n\r\n* Developing Modern Languages Specialist Subject Knowledge\r\n\r\nYou’ll have the opportunity to develop your subject teaching in a stimulating way, using different methodologies and to inspire and engage young people. We’ll help develop your understanding of the Modern Languages curriculum; how learners make progress in Modern Languages; planning and curriculum development; examination requirements and inclusion issues in Modern Languages, as well as auditing and developing subject specific knowledge to support effective Modern Languages teaching.\r\n\r\n* Supporting Learning and Progress in the Secondary School\r\n\r\nWe’ll prepare you for the classroom, allowing you to develop your own thinking, teaching skills and understanding of how to meet the needs of all learners. Themes include how young people learn, teaching and learning techniques to support pupils’ progress; behaviour management, assessment, inclusive, creative and innovative teaching methods and how to plan lessons and sequences of lessons. You will research evidence based learning theories, gain a greater understanding of current professional issues in secondary schools and begin to develop your own educational philosophy.\r\n\r\nYou’ll learn in small, friendly and supportive groups, designed to give you the confidence to succeed. Course tutors are very experienced and you’ll have a personal academic tutor to support you through your studies. Teaching is through workshops, tutorials and lectures, some with guest speakers, and through group work with other trainee teachers.\r\n\r\nTwo of the PGCE modules are at Master’s level and you’ll have the opportunity to continue your studies further to complete a Master’s degree, supporting your early professional development.\r\n\r\nAssessment is typically through the completion of a range of classroom activities, written assignments, reports, personal subject audits and the development of portfolios of evidence. There are no formal examinations and the assignments are carefully designed to help you to develop your teaching practice further. Upon successful completion of the programme we recommend Qualified Teaching Status be awarded by the Department for Education.","interviewProcess":"You will be shortlisted for interview based on your application.
