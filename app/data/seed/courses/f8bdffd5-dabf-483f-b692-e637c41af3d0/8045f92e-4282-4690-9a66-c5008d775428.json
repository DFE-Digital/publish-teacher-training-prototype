The module achieves these purposes by enhancing the ability to reflect critically on, and to evaluate, teaching and learning; by recognising particular curriculum and professional challenges; and by developing critical responses to these concerns in sophisticated, innovative and creative ways. Key learning activities of the module are practical teaching experience and the engagement with other specialists through collaborative practice.\r\nPolicy and Professional Issues\r\nThis module will develop your understanding of the concept of policy, professionalism and the influences that shape it.
