Schools are involved in the recruitment and selection of trainees and want to employ the most competent of teachers in their schools. The central training sessions address the key areas of professional practice including: - assessment, lesson planning, behaviour management, Safeguarding Level 1, Data and Progress 8, EAL, Inclusion and Diversity, Literacy, Phonics, Numeracy and Special Educational Needs and Disability; this training continues for trainees in their schools.  Subject specific training is also delivered centrally and continues under the guidance of mentor and PT.  Leeds Trinity  deliver all elements of the PGCE academic reading and writing.\r\nCurriculum Studies\r\nThe training programme is designed to develop subject knowledge and understanding of the current curriculum issues in the chosen subject or phase of training. \r\n\r\nIn the classroom\r\n\r\nThe programme is designed to develop pedagogical skills. The school- based training begins with observations of experienced practitioners where trainees learn to identify key elements of a successful lesson. Small group teaching, team teaching and co -planning of lessons are integral to build confidence and expertise. With this experience, trainees begin to develop all the skills of an outstanding teacher, independently and confidently planning and teaching. By the end of the training programme they will be teaching 70 -80% of a newly qualified teacher.\r\n\r\n The Assessment of Trainees\r\n\r\nFor the successful completion of the course, trainees must demonstrate competence against all the QTS standards. Trainees will be continually assessed through lesson observations. The Professional Tutor will complete a TPR each half-term which documents the progress made in each of the Standards.   This is moderated by the PLT.  Throughout the year, evidence will be collected in lesson observation, training and subject knowledge file and evidence against the standards collated in a final presentation file.  This evidence is also moderated by Leeds Trinity.\r\n","interviewProcess":"The selection procedures which follow aim to ensure that:\r\nEntry requirements specified in DfE Qualified Teacher Status Standards (2012) are applied carefully, giving due weight to academic equivalencies, experiences and motivation.\r\n\r\nEntrants are given a sound understanding of the nature and demands of the course in order to assure successful applicants complete the course and enjoy their new profession in education\r\nSelection will be based on: - a teaching activity related to the age and phase of the class, completion of a written task and a formal interview. \r\nDocumentation\r\nApplicants are asked to bring to the interview the relevant certificates which verify the academic profile described on the application form.
