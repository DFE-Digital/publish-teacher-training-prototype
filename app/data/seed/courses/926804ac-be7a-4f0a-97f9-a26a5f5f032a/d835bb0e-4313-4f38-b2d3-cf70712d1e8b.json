We are looking for people who demonstrate a passion for developing the learning experiences of adult learners.  We do look for trainee teachers who are willing to have a go; eager to engage, and up for a challenge. We create confident, competent teachers and a willingness to take on board feedback and use it to develop is something we look for.\r\n","otherRequirements":"You must also have:\r\n\r\n•An enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check\r\n•A completed medical pro forma (based on DFEE Circular 8/92)\r\n\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:48:31.269Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-16T08:34:27.816Z","cycle":"2023","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
