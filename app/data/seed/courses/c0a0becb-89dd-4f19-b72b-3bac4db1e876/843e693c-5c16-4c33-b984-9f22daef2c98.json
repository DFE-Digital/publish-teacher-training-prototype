School Direct Primary (5-11yrs) teacher training with PKTSA will equip you with the skills to  support and inspire students around primary education, making it enjoyable whilst equipping them with the skills they will need for the future.\r\n\r\nSchool Direct (Salaried) is an employment based route for high quality  graduates with at least 3 years work experience, not necessarily in education.\r\n\r\nWe will support, challenge and nurture you to become a confident and reflective practitioner in the classroom, able to teach contemporary methods and practices across a range of ages and abilities on a daily basis. All this alongside gaining a theoretical understanding of teaching and learning. \r\n\r\nThe huge benefit in choosing School Direct is that you get to have a say in which school , within the alliance, you are placed in. We work with you from the start to find the school which suits you and which matches your location. There will also be a complementary placement at one of our alliance schools.\r\n\r\nThis is an intensive and demanding course, which offers superb preparation for anyone who is committed to educating young people.  On finishing your training you will be awarded Qualified Teacher Status and 90 credits towards a Master's in Education.\r\n\r\nThere is also a strong possibility that trainees will be offered a position at their school at the end of the training year, or within the President Kennedy School Teaching Alliance. \r\n\r\n[presidentkennedytsa.co.uk](https://www.presidentkennedytsa.co.uk)\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"The interview process is a chance for you to meet us, as well as us you. We hold interviews in a variety of alliance schools, giving you a chance to see the pupils, meet the PKTSA team and also specific school staff who will potentially be supporting you through your training and beyond. The interview may be online.\r\n\r\nYou will be required to attend one interview. Interviews can include:\r\n* Exploration of curriculum knowledge\r\n* Discussions about relevant experiences\r\n* A presentation or small teaching exercise\r\n* Written or verbal discussion on literacy/numeracy knowledge\r\n\r\nPrior to the interview you will be given a topic for a teaching task on which to base a micro lesson. This topic will be delivered to a small group of students. This is an opportunity for you to show your wider skills, attitude, aptitude and resilience that can be developed over the training year, rather than assessing specific teaching ability at this stage. We know you are not a trained teacher and will not be judging you as such, just looking for your potential.\r\n\r\nNear the end of the interview we will discuss next steps with you; what choices of school you may have, how you can potentially accept our offer and how you can, if you wish, keep in touch with your chosen school, so when you start the following September you are confident knowing the staff and pupils.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"President Kennedy consists of an alliance of over 20 primary and secondary schools, across a wide geographic area; Coventry, Hinckley, Leamington Spa and Warwick.
