All this alongside gaining a theoretical understanding of teaching and learning. \r\n\r\nThe huge benefit in choosing School Direct (training) is that you get to have a say in which school , within the alliance, you are placed in.

This topic will be delivered to a small group of students. This is an opportunity for you to show your wider skills, attitude, aptitude and resilience that can be developed over the training year, rather than assessing specific teaching ability at this stage. We know you are not a trained teacher and will not be judging you as such, just looking for your potential.\r\n\r\nNear the end of the interview we will discuss next steps with you; what choices of school you may have, how you can potentially accept our offer and how you can, if you wish, keep in touch with your chosen school, so when you start the following September you are confident knowing the staff and pupils.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Futures Teaching consists of an alliance of over 20 primary and secondary schools, across a wide geographic area; Coventry, Hinckley, Leamington Spa and Warwick.
