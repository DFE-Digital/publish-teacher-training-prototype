Alongside your students, you will discuss key historical concepts such as change and continuity, cause and consequence, and significance to draw conclusions, analyse trends in history and frame historically-valid questions. \r\n\r\nYou will deliver lessons that support students to effectively analyse; and then prioritise information, which will allow them to make informed decisions â€“ a great life skill that all universities and employers will appreciate. Your students will explore key themes such as the struggle between the church and crown, and the impact that this had on the ruling classes but also on the lives of the ordinary people. \r\n\r\nYour classroom will be brimming with opportunities for students to frame their own historical questions, and through the use of the methods of historical enquiry, make supported judgements to answer them.\r\n\r\nOn completion of this programme, you will be awarded a PGCE with QTS and 60 Masters credits in Education from the University of York. You'll be delighted to know that we have a strong partnership with the University of York, creating a collaborative model of training. \r\n\r\n[Click here to read about one of our History trainees](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b3b3ce0266c0780e2b0138d/t/5fce061dc00f007cea0e13da/1607337504608/Daniel+Scott.pdf)","interviewProcess":"If you meet our entry requirements, you will be invited to a remote interview to complete our selection process. \r\n\r\n[Click here to explore our remote interview process](https://teachnorth.com/remote-interviews)","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"During the programme, you will complete two placements in our alliance schools and academies.
