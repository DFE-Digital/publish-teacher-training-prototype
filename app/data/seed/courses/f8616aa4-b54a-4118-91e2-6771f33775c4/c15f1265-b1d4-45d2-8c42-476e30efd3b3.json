It is, therefore, important to include all the relevant information on the form to help us make this decision.\r\n\r\nIf you are invited to interview and have a disability, please let the Course Administrator know in advance if there are any special arrangements that should be made for the interview process, for example large print copies of documentation, additional time for reading or wheelchair access to the interview rooms.\r\n\r\nYou will be sent information about a 15 minute subject specific teaching task. The activity should be devised to be appropriate for a group of Year 10 (14 - 15) students. The interview panel will then ask you several questions to establish your motivation for wanting to teach in your chosen subject area and some administration questions. There will also be an opportunity for you to ask questions about the course. During the interview process there will be a literacy and numeracy activity to complete.\r\n\r\nThe formal interview panel will be made up of a subject specialist and one of the ALP (Advance Learning Partnership) Directors.\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The course is full time and runs from September until the beginning of July.
