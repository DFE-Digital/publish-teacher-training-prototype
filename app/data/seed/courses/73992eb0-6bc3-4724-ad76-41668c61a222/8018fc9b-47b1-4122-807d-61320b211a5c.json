Trainees learn to develop their students’ abilities to create works in different media. The course includes the use of technology in education, along with Sixth Form experience.\r\n\r\nThe Astra approach has at its core the principle of developing trainees as reflective professionals who have strong practical classroom skills and excellent subject knowledge. Trainees learn how to use current theory to inform their classroom practice and attention is paid to ensuring that trainees have a detailed understanding of Computing as a school subject, as well as outstanding skills in learning to plan and teach lessons which are creative and engaging.\r\n\r\nSubject studies are taught by a team of highly experienced practising classroom teachers who have worked with trainees over many years.\r\n\r\nAstra trainees spend four days per week in their placement schools (minimum of 120 days across the year). All training and assessment will lead to the award of Qualified Teacher Status by the DfE.  \r\n\r\n Your curriculum will follow the core content framework, with final assessment against the Teachers' Standard,  based on evidence of your teaching, wider contribution to school life and the ability to reflect on and evaluate these experiences.  Progress is monitored through weekly reflections on progress, objective setting, regular lesson observations and two QTS assignments. \r\n\r\nWeekly QTS Professional Studies will develop understanding of education essential for entrants to the teaching profession, providing consideration to whole-school issues, such as behaviour management, special educational needs and educational theories that contextualise the teaching of your subject. Secondary subject studies also focus on the teaching of each subject, including its place in the National Curriculum; what is taught; how it is taught; how it is assessed; providing for young people with different backgrounds and abilities; teaching in accordance with examination specification requirements; and using ICT effectively to facilitate learning.\r\n\r\nSalaried trainees are contracted to be an employee of their main placement school and are likely to be accountable for up to a 50% timetable across four days from the start of the course.  This allocation will increase as the training year progresses.  Time in school will also be allocated for observing experienced teachers, team teaching, working with small groups of students and getting involved in the wider aspects of school life.  ","interviewProcess":"There are three Hubs operating on behalf of the Astra SCITT for both primary and secondary recruitment across our network of over 50 schools:\r\n\r\n* Astra SCITT/Astra Amersham Hub - Amersham and surrounding area\r\n* Astra Aylesbury Hub - Aylesbury and surrounding area\r\n* Astra Marlow Hub - Marlow / Maidenhead \r\n\r\nCandidates should apply via DfE Apply to their preferred Astra Hub, which will then coordinate the recruitment process.  \r\n\r\nThe application and interview process for each hub is identical and is quality assured by the SCITT leadership team. It will take one of the following formats: \r\n1. Stage 1 will be conducted remotely and consist of a panel interview, delivery of a short presentation, and some written tasks.  If successful at this stage, you will be invited to attend a Stage 2 interview, which will, where possible involve a visit to your potential main placement school to be observed leading a teaching activity with a small group of students; you will be told in advance about the content of the lesson you will need to plan, and the age group you will be teaching.  \r\n2. Stages 1 and 2 will both be conducted remotely, with you being asked to ‘teach’ part of a lesson to the interview panel following the main panel interview\r\n\r\nApplicants for salaried positions may be asked to teach a full lesson and/or complete other tasks which the employing school may specify.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We endeavour to match the right trainee to the right partner school for their main placement based on their initial preference, geography / distance from home, and areas of specific interest.
