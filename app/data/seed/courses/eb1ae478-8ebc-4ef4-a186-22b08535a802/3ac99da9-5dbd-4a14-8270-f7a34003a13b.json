Complementing the programme of training sessions at Bishop Grosseteste University, we draw on the expertise and strengths of outstanding classroom teachers, mentors and leadership team members from across the alliance to support participants through a tailored training programme. Through our partnership of largely Outstanding and Good schools we offer training places in a wide range of subjects and phases which change annually based on school demand.\r\nThis PGCE course prepares you to teach children in the 5 to 11 age range as a general primary teacher. It is a very practical course with around two-thirds of the time spent in schools, mostly working with teachers and pupils, and around one third spent on directed study, with partnership training in the University and school.
