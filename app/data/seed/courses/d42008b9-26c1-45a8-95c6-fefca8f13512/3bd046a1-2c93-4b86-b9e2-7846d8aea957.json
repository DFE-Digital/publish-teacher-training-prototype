Whether they decide to continue with further education, become an employee or start their own business, Business education brings together theory and practical applications to help build success. Business education gives students the opportunity to understand how local, national and international businesses functions, the role it plays in our society, the opportunities it generates, the skills it requires, and the impact it can have on our lives and local and international economies. We are surrounded by real world applications which enrich learning for Business students.\r\n\r\nOur Business teacher education provides carefully structured, professional learning opportunities which enable trainees to critically and effectively progress in planning, teaching and assessing successful Business education.
