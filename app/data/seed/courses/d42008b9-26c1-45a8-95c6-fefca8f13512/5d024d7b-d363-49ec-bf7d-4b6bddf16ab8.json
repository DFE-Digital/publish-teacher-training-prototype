The PGCE Science course at Sussex recognises that effective Science teaching is about enabling pupils to learn, think and question. The central aim of the course is to develop committed, thoughtful and effective Science teachers who will encourage their pupils to think for themselves and enjoy their learning experience. Our ethos is based on collaboration and as such we recognise that all our trainees, whatever their background, have something to contribute to the cohort.\r\n\r\nScience courses at Sussex are among the most established within Initial Teacher Education in the UK, and have a well-deserved reputation for developing successful specialist teachers. The commitment of many local Science teachers and professional tutors to our courses has ensured their quality over the years and this dedication and support is greatly appreciated by trainees and university-based curriculum tutors.\r\n\r\nWe work in partnership with local schools, in respect of placements as well as for our taught sessions at the University. We have a genuine commitment to working in original ways - to enhance your training and, through you, the learning of young people.\r\n\r\nTeaching, learning and assessment\r\nYou will learn to be a Science teacher through a combination of taught sessions at the University and school-led professional development and classroom practice. You will start your course with a 2-3 week induction at the University in September, followed by a programme of lectures, seminars and workshops every Friday. These involve presentations, group work, classroom modelling and peer teaching for which you will explore ideas and approaches and reflect on your own experiences.\r\n\r\nYou will undertake two periods of professional practice in two different schools (these may vary slightly in length, but will equate to a minimum of 120 working days in total). You will be supported in your professional placements by a Science specialist who will act as a mentor, offering you tutorial support and developing a programme of practice-based professional studies for you. Your progress will be assessed through observations, feedback and discussion. To this end, you will create and maintain a portfolio of evidence demonstrating how you have met the various Teacher's Standards.\r\n\r\nYou will engage with the theoretical foundations of classroom practice and demonstrate the depth of your professional knowledge by completing three academic assignments during the course.","interviewProcess":"Applicants who meet the entry requirements will be invited to a selection event either face to face or online via Zoom. Following a successful interview schools will then invite the candidate for a school interview.\r\n\r\nAs part of the interview process candidates can expect to;\r\n\r\nBefore the selection day \r\n* Listen to a video talk giving further information about the course\r\n* Complete some paperwork including our 'Suitability for Teaching Declaration'. \r\nBoth the above will be sent to you by email in your invitation to interview\r\n\r\nOn the selection day \r\n* Have an individual online interview, via Zoom or face to face with a tutor and an experienced  teacher from a partnership school\r\n* Deliver a short pre-prepared classroom type teaching task or presentation to the panel.

Trainee teachers need a variety of experience in schools to enable them to meet all the Teachers’ Standards. They need to teach children and young people in their specified age range, from different backgrounds, as well as gaining experience of different approaches to teaching and to school organisation and management. \r\n \r\nProfessional Practice 1 is the period of time from the end of September to Christmas During Professional Practice 1, Trainees spend Monday to Thursday in school and Friday at University. \r\n \r\nProfessional Practice 2 is the period of time from January until May half term which includes the second school placement During Professional Practice 2, Trainees attend University on a fewer number of Fridays held at strategic points in the placement.
