Enabling learners to become independent, critical thinkers who develop expertise in formulating problems and their solutions is crucial, and helping them to identify and talk about scenarios leads to success not only in Computer Science, but also in other areas of the curriculum as well as life in general.\r\n\r\nYou will gain an understanding of how to develop the computational thinking skills of your learners, developing connections between your own knowledge and passion for computing and the importance of trial and error, reflection, analysis and evaluation. You will help learners become the creators of technology, not just users of technology, by understanding the role of computing in the classroom, teaching and learning theory, moral and social issues arising from the widespread use of computers and, of course, the teaching of the Computing National Curriculum and examinations at both GCSE and GCE level. Opportunities to study and reflect with other trainees ensure you can be part of evolving an invaluable network of peer support.\r\n\r\nThe Computer Science team here at Sussex is drawn equally from the University and our schools partnership.
