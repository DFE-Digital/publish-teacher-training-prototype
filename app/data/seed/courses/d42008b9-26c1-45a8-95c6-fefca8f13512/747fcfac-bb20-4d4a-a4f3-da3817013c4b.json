Enabling learners to become independent, critical thinkers who develop expertise in formulating problems and their solutions is crucial, and helping them to identify and talk about scenarios leads to success not only in Computer Science, but also in other areas of the curriculum as well as life in general.\r\n\r\nYou will gain an understanding of how to develop the computational thinking skills of your learners, developing connections between your own knowledge and passion for computing and the importance of trial and error, reflection, analysis and evaluation. You will help learners become the creators of technology, not just users of technology, by understanding the role of computing in the classroom, teaching and learning theory, moral and social issues arising from the widespread use of computers and, of course, the teaching of the Computing National Curriculum and examinations at both GCSE and GCE level. Opportunities to study and reflect with other trainees ensure you can be part of evolving an invaluable network of peer support.\r\n\r\nThe Computer Science team here at Sussex is drawn equally from the University and our schools partnership. Teaching faculty include tutors with experience as Heads of Department and teacher-educator researchers who specialise in developing heuristic learning.\r\n\r\nYou will learn to become a Computer Science teacher through a combination of taught sessions at the University and school-led professional development and classroom practice.

These involve presentations, group work, role play, classroom modelling and peer teaching, for which you will explore ideas and approaches and reflect on your own experiences.\r\n\r\nYou will undertake two periods of professional practice in two different schools  You will be supported in your professional placements by a Computer Science specialist, who will act as a mentor, offering you tutorial support and developing a programme of practice-based professional studies for you. Your progress will be assessed through observations, feedback and discussion and you will create and maintain a portfolio of evidence demonstrating how you have met the various Teachers' Standards.\r\n\r\nYou will engage with the theoretical foundations of classroom practice and demonstrate the depth of your professional knowledge by completing three academic assignments during the course.","interviewProcess":"Applicants who meet the entry requirements will be invited to a selection event either face to face or online via Zoom.
