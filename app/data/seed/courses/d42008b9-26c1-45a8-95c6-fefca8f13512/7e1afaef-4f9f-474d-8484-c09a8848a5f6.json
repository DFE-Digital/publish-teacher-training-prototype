Enabling pupils to become independent, critical readers who love reading and talking about texts with teachers and peers will allow them to succeed in all other areas of the English - and indeed the school - curriculum. Therefore, you will gain understanding of how to develop the reading abilities of your pupils, drawing connections between your own knowledge and love of literature and the comprehension strategies and exposure to challenging texts that will enable your pupils to become similarly enthusiastic, engaged readers. Exploratory talk about texts is also central to developing pupils' talk and writing, combined with rich, textual models. You will deepen your own grammatical understanding and that of your pupils, enabling them to become creative, effective writers.\r\n\r\nDrama offers school pupils the opportunity to enrich their lives and communities, explore complex issues and emotions, and build their self-confidence and practical skills. Drama nourishes pupils, gives them a wide range of experience from working in groups, and makes them use their imagination to acquire technical and design expertise. You will develop your understanding of the place of this subject within Secondary education, and learn a range of strategies for teaching this exciting subject. Beyond the classroom, you will engage in the broader role and position of Drama in school life, supporting - and sometimes leading - performances and productions.\r\n\r\nOur partnership believes that Drama should be an inclusive experience for everyone. Distinctive features of our course include the different inputs offered by local school practitioners, as well as teaching labs where cohorts can stretch and challenge each other in practice-based workshops.\r\n\r\nMany English and Drama teacher trainees go on to teach both subjects. Some choose to specialise in one or the other, while enhancing their teaching with the knowledge and skills acquired while training in the second subject. Many progress to our Masters courses to continue to enhance their teaching abilities and deepen their subject knowledge by researching best practice.","interviewProcess":"Applicants who meet the entry requirements will be invited to a selection event either face to face or online via Zoom.
