The importance of the subject is recognised by its inclusion in the English Baccalaureate, and its popularity evidenced by a continuing rise in Geography exam entries. Our approach to the subject roots Geography education in real-world enquiry, decision-making and a commitment to out-of-classroom learning through which young people can become more aware of their place within their local, as well as their global community.\r\n\r\n\r\nSussex PGCE is designed to produce creative and inspiring, as well as highly skilled and rigorous, Geography teachers. The course will introduce you to a range of teaching and learning strategies, including the use of data handling (cartographic, numerical, visual, digital) and analytical skills which help to make Geography students the most employable graduates.\r\n\r\nSessions taught at the University include opportunities for sharing experiences and classroom resources, as well as for drawing on local and national expertise. Sessions will be taught on campus, and also within partner schools and other off-campus locations. Fieldwork is an important part of this course, including a residential weekend which trainees are expected to participate in.\r\n\r\nYou will learn to be a Geography teacher through a combination of taught sessions at the University and school-led professional development and classroom practice. You will start your course with a 2-3 week induction at the University in September, which is followed by a programme of lectures, seminars and workshops every Friday. These involve presentations, group work, role play, classroom modelling and peer teaching for which you will explore ideas and approaches and reflect on your own experiences.\r\n\r\nYou will undertake two periods of professional practice in two different schools. You will be supported in your professional placements by a Geography specialist who will act as a mentor, offering you tutorial support and developing a programme of practice-based professional studies for you. Your progress will be assessed through observations, feedback and discussion. To this end, you will create and maintain a portfolio of evidence demonstrating how you have met the various Teacher's Standards.\r\n\r\nYou will engage with the theoretical foundations of classroom practice and demonstrate the depth of your professional knowledge by completing three academic assignments during the course.","interviewProcess":"Applicants who meet the entry requirements will be invited to a selection event either face to face or online via Zoom.

Trainees benefit from a serial placement where the working week is divided between four days in school and a day of reflection and training at the University on Fridays. This ensures a weekly focus on theory and pedagogy as well as practice.\r\n\r\nPlacement 2: February Halfterm to Easter in a contrasting school or college with a return to your original placement school until May half term to complete the course.
