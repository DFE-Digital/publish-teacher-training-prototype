We start with induction, and end with the enrichment week.  In between those are the two school professional practices and the assignments.  Induction – Placement one – APK – Placement 2 – RPK – Enrichment week \r\n \r\nInduction \r\n\r\nThe structure is mainly the same each Friday. In the morning you will be involved as a Cosmo group in exploring some practical aspects of teaching as well as have the opportunity to discuss and learn about some pedagogic aspect of teaching.  In the afternoon you will meet with your subject tutor who will follow your subject specific programme for the year \r\n \r\nProfessional Practice One \r\n \r\nIn your first Professional practice, you will be inducted into school in the first few weeks.  You should have the opportunity to observe pupils and teachers as a way of seeing how the school policies work in action.  It is intended that you will have a gradual introduction to teaching a lesson and should be able to plan small sections of lessons (such as starters and plenaries) before being given a whole lesson to teach.  Normally we would not expect a trainee teacher to teach more than one whole lesson before the October half term, although this may be modified for the skills of the individual teacher.  Note that everyone will have different inductions in their schools.  Try not to compare or fret; if you are unsettled talk to your tutor.  \r\n \r\nWe would hope that you would be working towards a timetable of 8 hours by Christmas.  Remember that we will all progress at various rates and there is no ‘normal’ progression for a trainee teacher.  You will maintain these 8 hours after Christmas to the end of the placement. \r\n\r\n\r\nProfessional Practice Two In this professional practice, you will spend more of the week in school.  There are only a few Friday sessions at University to allow you to teach more hours in school.  As with professional practice one there should be a short period of induction when you arrive at professional practice two where you are given the opportunity to see how the school policies work in action. \r\n \r\nYou will be working towards a timetable of 12 hours per week in this professional practice.  Possibly a few more hours towards the end of the placement.  \r\n\r\nhttp://www.sussex.ac.uk/education/ite/pgceandschooldirectsecondary/englishdrama\r\n\r\n ","interviewProcess":"You will be required to attend two interviews one at the University and one at the school that you wish to apply for. \r\n\r\nBelow is an example of  the University and School interview process-\r\n\r\nUniversity Interview\r\nArrival and document check \r\n11.00 – 12.30 Welcome and overview of the programme with opportunity to ask questions.

Trainee teachers need a variety of experience in schools to enable them to meet all the Teachers’ Standards. They need to teach children and young people in their specified age range, from different backgrounds, as well as gaining experience of different approaches to teaching and to school organisation and management. \r\n \r\nProfessional Practice 1 is the period of time from the end of September to Christmas During Professional Practice 1, Trainees spend Monday to Thursday in school and Friday at University. \r\n \r\nProfessional Practice 2 is the period of time from January until May half term which includes the second school placement During Professional Practice 2, Trainees attend University on a fewer number of Fridays held at strategic points in the placement. \r\n ","personalQualities":"","otherRequirements":"","status":2,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:49:42.274Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2023"}
