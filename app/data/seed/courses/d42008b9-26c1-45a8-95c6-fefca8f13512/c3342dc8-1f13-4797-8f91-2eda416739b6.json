Classics is growing in popularity and offers schools and pupils a rich and exciting addition to the school curriculum.\r\n\r\nOur Classics course provides carefully structured, professional learning opportunities which will enable you to critically and effectively progress in planning, teaching and assessing successful Classics teaching and learning. Together, university teacher educators and excellent classroom practitioners share their enthusiasm and professional knowledge to give you opportunities to focus on how best to engage, enthuse and enlighten your pupils in their understandings of the past.\r\n\r\nYou are encouraged to take an active role in your own professional learning by developing secure knowledge of the curriculum whilst recognising how your pupils make sense of the classical world and its language. University and school-based sessions draw on local and national expertise, offering perspectives and strategies on a range of different teaching issues, from accessing original historical sources at local and national museums, to engaging pupils in the sensitive, controversial and emotive nature of life experiences in ancient Rome and Greece.\r\n\r\nYou will learn to be a Classics teacher through a combination of taught sessions at the University and school-led professional development and classroom practice. You will start your course with a 2-3 week induction at the University in September, which is followed by a programme of lectures, seminars and workshops every Friday. These involve presentations, group work, role play, classroom modelling and peer teaching for which you will explore ideas and approaches and reflect on your own experiences. Those studying the Classics ITE course opt to specialise in an ancient language, or take History as a secondary subject.\r\n \r\nYou will undertake two periods of professional practice in two different schools. You will be supported  by a specialist who will act as a mentor, offering you tutorial support and developing a programme of practice-based professional studies for you. Your progress will be assessed through observations, feedback and discussion. You will create and maintain a portfolio of evidence demonstrating how you have met the various Teacher's Standards.\r\n\r\nYou will engage with the theoretical foundations of classroom practice and demonstrate the depth of your professional knowledge by completing three academic assignments during the course.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Applicants who meet the entry requirements will be invited to a selection event either face to face or online via Zoom. Following a successful interview schools will then invite the candidate for a school interview.\r\n\r\nAs part of the interview process candidates can expect to;\r\n\r\nBefore the selection day \r\n* Listen to a video talk giving further information about the course\r\n* Complete some paperwork including our 'Suitability for Teaching Declaration'. \r\nBoth the above will be sent to you by email in your invitation to interview\r\n\r\nOn the selection day \r\n* Have an individual online interview, via Zoom or face to face with a tutor and an experienced  teacher from a partnership school\r\n* Deliver a short pre-prepared classroom type teaching task or presentation to the panel.
