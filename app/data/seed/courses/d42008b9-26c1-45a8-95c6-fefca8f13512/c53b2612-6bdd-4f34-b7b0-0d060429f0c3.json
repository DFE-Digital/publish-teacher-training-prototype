The commitment of many local Mathematics teachers and professional tutors to this course has done a great deal to ensure its quality over the years. \r\n\r\nWe help you to develop a deeper understanding of the complex nature of Mathematics as a subject, and to consider the contribution of the subject to young people's education. We support you so that you can prepare for, and reflect on, your practical teaching skills in order to develop them alongside a critical awareness of relevant issues in education. We will equip you with the fundamental information, perspectives, insights and skills you need to be an effective Mathematics teacher.\r\n\r\nWe work creatively and professionally with curriculum/professional tutors and Mathematics teachers to enhance your understanding of teaching. The taught sessions we run are practically, as well as theoretically, driven to develop reflective, innovative and creative Mathematics teachers. Through a range of activities and approaches, we anticipate that beginning teachers from Sussex will establish themselves within a national community of Mathematics teachers who take pride in enthusing children about the subject by teaching them the skills to be successful learners and understand the relevance of Mathematics in everyday life.\r\n\r\nYou will learn through a combination of taught sessions at the University and school-led professional development and classroom practice. You will start your course with a 2-3 week induction at the University in September, which is followed by a programme of lectures, seminars and workshops every Friday. These involve presentations, group work, role play, classroom modelling and peer teaching for which you will explore ideas and approaches and reflect on your own experiences.\r\n\r\nYou will undertake two periods of professional practice in two different schools. You will be supported in your professional placements by a Mathematics specialist who will act as a mentor, offering you tutorial support and developing a programme of practice-based professional studies for you. Your progress will be assessed through observations, feedback and discussion. You will create and maintain a portfolio of evidence demonstrating how you have met the various Teacher's Standards.\r\n\r\nYou will engage with the theoretical foundations of classroom practice and demonstrate the depth of your professional knowledge by completing three academic assignments during the course.","interviewProcess":"Applicants who meet the entry requirements will be invited to a selection event either face to face or online via Zoom. Following a successful interview schools will then invite the candidate for a school interview.\r\n\r\nAs part of the interview process candidates can expect to;\r\n\r\nBefore the selection day \r\n* Listen to a video talk giving further information about the course\r\n* Complete some paperwork including our 'Suitability for Teaching Declaration'. \r\nBoth the above will be sent to you by email in your invitation to interview\r\n\r\nOn the selection day \r\n* Have an individual online interview, via Zoom or face to face with a tutor and an experienced  teacher from a partnership school\r\n* Deliver a short pre-prepared classroom type teaching task or presentation to the panel. You will receive details of the task in your invitation to interview.\r\n* Show the interview panel a form of photo ID on camera or in person for checking\r\n* Have an opportunity to ask the panel questions you may have about the course and your individual circumstances.\r\n\r\nAfter the selection day\r\n* If we offer you a place on the course and you decide to accept we will need you to provide your original Undergraduate Degree, and GCSE Maths and English certificates \r\n\r\nShowing  an awareness of the curriculum and school life is part of the selection process so candidates may wish to prepare themselves by spending some time in an appropriate school setting for the subject/phase they intend to teach beforehand.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Our Full-time Course\r\nYou will undertake two periods of Professional Practice in two contrasting schools over the academic year September to June, training to teach in Key Stage 4 (14-16) and Key Stage 5 (16-18).\r\n\r\nPlacement 1: End of September to February halfterm. Trainees benefit from a serial placement where the working week is divided between four days in school and a day of reflection and training at the University on Fridays. This ensures a weekly focus on theory and pedagogy as well as practice.\r\n\r\nPlacement 2: February Halfterm to Easter in a contrasting school or college with a return to your original placement school until May half term to complete the course. There are fewer University days to give you experience of working a 5 day school week. \r\n\r\n ","personalQualities":"As a partnership we are looking for; \r\n* A passion for Mathematics and interest and involvement beyond your degree\r\n* A strong knowledge and understanding of the study of Mathematics, and a sound awareness of how the subject is taught within UK secondary schools\r\n* Effective communication skills and good organisational skills\r\n* Awareness of current educational developments and issues\r\n* Experience with young people and commitment to developing individuals\r\n* The ability to evaluate practice and address your weaknesses\r\n* Initiative, flexibility and responsiveness to change\r\n* A sense of responsibility and ability to work in a team.\r\n","otherRequirements":"Working with children: You must not be excluded from working with children, as a result of a criminal record or other reason.
