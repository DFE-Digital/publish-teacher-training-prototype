It is an alternative to a traditional full-time university course, offering a postgraduate-level qualification, no tuition fees, and the opportunity to earn while you learn.\r\nPostgraduate Teaching Apprenticeships are available for prospective primary and secondary school teachers in England.\r\n\r\nYou’ll be employed by a school while you learn on the job. In some cases, this may be a school you’re already working at, or have an existing relationship with.\r\n\r\nAs Postgraduate Teaching Apprenticeships are new, there are currently only a limited number of vacancies. Each training provider will have a set plan for when they’re opening theirs, so keep a look out.\r\nIf you’re currently working as an unqualified teacher or teaching assistant, it offers new opportunities for career progression, plus higher earning capacity, recognition, and status.\r\n\r\nYou’ll receive a combination of classroom teaching and off-the-job training as you to work towards Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).\r\n\r\nCheck with your training provider to find out if the apprenticeship also includes a PGCE and master's level credits. Where this is an option, there may be an additional cost required for completion of the PGCE.\r\n\r\nSimilar to School Direct (salaried) programmes, you’ll be employed directly by the school. Unlike School Direct (salaried) programmes:\r\nPostgraduate Teaching Apprenticeship programmes combine paid work with on and off-the-job training. The design of the programme has been led by a group of experienced schools and teachers, specifically for apprentices\r\n\r\napprentices will split their time between school and university study. You’ll receive practical, school-led training alongside experienced staff, and spend at least 20% of your time off-timetable to learn the pedagogy of teaching\r\n\r\nin addition to working towards QTS on successful completion of the course, apprentices will also complete an end point assessment (EPA) after the summer to consolidate learning from initial teacher training","interviewProcess":"You will be required to attend two interviews, one at the University and one at the school that you wish to apply for.  \r\n\r\nUniversity interviews will be a mixture of virtual and in person.
