It fosters curiosity and enquiry, reveals the complexity of identities, and allows pupils to place their world in a local, national and global context. History continues to stand out as one of the most popular and successful taught areas of the curriculum.\r\n\r\nOur teacher education provides carefully structured, professional learning opportunities which will enable you to critically and effectively progress in planning, teaching and assessing successful school History. University teacher educators and excellent classroom practitioners share their enthusiasm and professional knowledge to give you opportunities to focus on how to best engage, enthuse and enlighten your pupils in their understandings of the past.\r\n\r\nBuilding on successful and engaging practice, you are encouraged to take an active role in your own professional learning by developing secure knowledge of the History curriculum whilst recognising how pupils make sense of the past from Key Stage 3 through to A level. The nature of significance, the excitement of enquiry, and the challenges of historical interpretations are all practically explored alongside conceptions of chronology, change, continuity and causation. University and school-based sessions draw on local and national expertise, offering perspectives and startegies on a range of different teaching issues, from accessing original historical sources at local and national museums and archives, to engaging pupils in the sensitive, controversial and emotive histories of slavery and the Holocaust.\r\nYou will learn through a combination of taught sessions at the University and school-led professional development and classroom practice. You will start your course with a 2-3 week induction at the University in September, which is followed by a programme of lectures, seminars and workshops every Friday. These involve presentations, group work, role play, classroom modelling and peer teaching for which you will explore ideas and approaches and reflect on your own experiences.\r\n\r\nYou will undertake two periods of professional practice in two different schools. You will be supported in your professional placements by a History specialist who will act as a mentor, offering you tutorial support and developing a programme of practice-based professional studies for you. Your progress will be assessed through observations, feedback and discussion. To this end, you will create and maintain a portfolio of evidence demonstrating how you have met the various Teacher's Standards.\r\n\r\nYou will engage with the theoretical foundations of classroom practice and demonstrate the depth of your professional knowledge by completing two compulsory assignments during the course.","interviewProcess":"Applicants who meet the entry requirements will be invited to a selection event either face to face or online via Zoom.
