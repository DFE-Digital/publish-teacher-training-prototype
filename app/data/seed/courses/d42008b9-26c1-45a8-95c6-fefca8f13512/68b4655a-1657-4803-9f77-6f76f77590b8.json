Throughout the Music ITE course, you will be encouraged to consider your pivotal role as a musician in bringing together music from both in and outside of the school environment, helping young people to make sense of their learning and nurturing their development.\r\n\r\nHaving an identity as a 'musician in the classroom', and the ability to facilitate creative music-making, are fundamental attributes of a successful Music teacher. You will build on your existing skills as a musician and develop your subject knowledge in previously unfamiliar areas - whether your background is traditional western classical, popular music, world music or music technology. You should be open to new styles and genres, and be prepared to broaden your musical horizons.\r\n\r\nMusic ITE is highly interactive and learning is gained through seminars, discussion, tutorials and practical workshops - such as singing, improvisation, composing and world music. Imaginatively run seminar groups and workshops - often led by visiting specialists - develop your confidence and expertise in areas such as approaches to GCSE and A level, creative teaching and learning strategies, and directing extra-curricular musical activities.\r\n\r\nYou are supported in the use of music technology, but not expected to have good skills in this area before you begin the course. We encourage 'hands on' sessions to develop skills and consider how technology can be effectively integrated in the classroom. The emphasis of the course is on applying knowledge gained in seminars to the classroom. A number of curriculum days are spent as a cohort in schools, allowing the opportunity to observe excellent practitioners in operation, and to participate in good practice.\r\n\r\nIn addition, some curriculum days are spent embedded in local school music departments, enabling observation of excellent practice and opportunities to try out different approaches and technologies. The Music team include practicing teachers and is active nationally and internationally in music education research and policy.","interviewProcess":"Applicants who meet the entry requirements will be invited to a selection event either face to face or online via Zoom.
