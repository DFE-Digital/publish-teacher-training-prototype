English is a core secondary school subject with a wide range of real-life applications. \r\n\r\nEnglish allows people to express their own ideas and feelings, to develop empathy, to challenge their own perceptions as well as the perceptions of the world around them, and to become independent and critical thinkers throughout their lives. Teaching English gives students a voice.\r\n\r\nAs well as training to teach English Language and Literature, you may undertake supporting studies such as Media Education and Drama.\r\n\r\nYou will learn how to teach the National Curriculum, the key stage 3 Framework for Teaching English and GCSE and develop an understanding of A level and other post 16 courses.\r\n\r\nWithin the principles of inclusive education, you will develop an understanding of children`s reading, writing, speaking and listening. You will also examine numerous barriers to learning, and determine how to help pupils overcome these.\r\n\r\nEnglish teachers are privileged in that they make dramatic differences to the future opportunities their pupils can access. They change lives.\r\n\r\nWhatever your route into teaching, whether you are coming straight from university, from academia or industry,  you will enjoy the support and guidance of experienced and passionate professionals as you begin your journey into science teaching.\r\n\r\nThis training course is a non-salaried PGCE (SCITT) QTS award and you will gain a PG Certificate (60 M-level CATS points).\r\n","interviewProcess":"The assessment day will involve a range of activities including the delivery of a short lesson, followed by an interview with the SCITT team and a representative of colleagues from our alliance schools. You will be assessed on your subject knowledge during the day. You will also be interviewed by our student panel and complete a written think piece. \r\nAll interviewers will consider the following: \r\n-\tYour communication skills \r\n-\tCommitment to teacher training and resilience\r\n-\tKnowledge and understanding of the qualities of a teacher \r\n-\tYour ability to reflect and evaluate your own practice and the practice of others\r\n-\tPersonal qualities and knowledge and understanding of the qualities of a teacher\r\n-\tYour subject knowledge\r\n-\tYour ability to interact with both adults and young people \r\nIt is a rigorous and thorough selection process, designed to recruit the very best candidates and ultimately the best trainee teachers for our students.\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will complete two placements in our partner schools, where you will have both a Subject Mentor and a Professional Mentor. Your role in the classroom increases gradually, at a pace you and your mentor feel is right for you. The first placement will begin in September with focused lesson observations, and then you will begin to deliver starts to lessons, undertake some team teaching and then plan and deliver whole lessons. The second placement begins after February half term, where you will be allocated to a different school within the partnership, which will give you a contrasting experience and broaden your professional development. \r\nAll of our partner schools have comprehensive intakes and you will have the experience of working with young people of all abilities. \r\nYou will have the opportunity of spending time in a primary setting to focus on transition, as well as gaining SEND experience, giving you an insight into all types of learners. At least one of your placements will give you access to post 16 learners to give you the experience of working with learners in all phases and contexts. \r\nThe first placement will start early September and involves teaching practice in school each week, with the majority of Fridays being conference days or subject-based days. Subject-based days are run by Subject Experts. Our conferences are planned and delivered by outstanding classroom practitioners from within our partner schools. \r\nYou will have full access to the facilities of both The Cheshire East SCITT Training Centre and The Manchester Metropolitan University. The majority of your time will be school based but there are a number of days where you will be based at the Training Centre at Holmes Chapel Comprehensive School and approximately five days at University, to focus on your Masters level work - far reduced compared to a traditional PGCE route.\r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for ambitious, energetic, dedicated, well-qualified, independent and enthusiastic trainee teachers who are passionate about their subject and have the desire, drive and commitment to inspire all abilities in the secondary age range.
