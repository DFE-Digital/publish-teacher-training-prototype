Together they offer a balance of practice and theory so that trainees develop classroom skills alongside the knowledge and understanding that underpins these skills, supporting their development as an informed and reflective teacher.\r\n\r\nTrainees complete the Master’s element of the programme through undertaking a series of online tasks and modules. They are allocated time (equivalent to one day a week) to undertake their personal study. Trainees  complete a personalised subject based training plan, with subject specialists providing taught input at various points throughout the year. \r\n \r\nAutumn Term: \r\n\r\nAll School Direct trainees start the course at Uffculme School for an induction period during September. During this time trainees participate in taught sessions and undertake tasks aimed at familiarising them with both the Teachers’ Standards and the Exeter Model for ITE. \r\nTrainees are placed in their home school for the rest of the term, returning to Uffculme School on the same day each week to complete their online learning. This model of training is a unique feature of our ITE programme and helps us to ensure that our Distance trainees feel supported and not isolated during their training year. \r\n\r\nSpring Term: \r\n\r\nWhereas most courses offer a 6 week contrasting placement, our 10 week placement provides the trainee with a fantastic opportunity to compare and contrast different approaches to all aspects of teaching and other wider areas of work that teachers are involved in. \r\n\r\nSummer Term:\r\n\r\nTrainees return to their home school to consolidate and extend their  practice. It is during this period that many of our strong trainees enter an 'Extension & Enrichment' phase. \r\n\r\nWhilst on placement trainees will have twelve contact hours a week of classroom-based work. \r\n\r\nAssessment:\r\n\r\n* 1. SPECIALIST SUBJECT KNOWLEDGE AND PEDAGOGY MODULE\r\n Masters level (30 credits) 6000 summative assignment (Autumn Term)\r\n* 2. EDUCATION AND PROFESSIONAL STUDIES (EPS) MODULE\r\n Masters level (30 credits) 6000 summative assignment (Spring Term)\r\n* 3. PROFESSIONAL LEARNING MODULE \r\nTrainees complete an Individual Development Portfolio (IDP) that contains evidence of achieving the Teachers' Standards.  \r\n\r\nSuccessful completion of all three modules leads to the award of Secondary PGCE with QTS.\r\n","interviewProcess":"All applications are screened initially by the University of Exeter Admissions department to check suitability for the programme. Suitable applicants will then be contacted by the West Country Training School Alliance and invited to attend an interview. \r\n\r\nThe interview with WCTSA has 3 elements consisting of: a teaching task, an observation task and a panel interview. Whilst Covid restrictions are in place, we have moved our ITT interviews online and these will be conducted via TEAMS. \r\n\r\nPre-interview Task 1: \r\n\r\nOne week before the interview, applicants will be sent a short video clip of a lesson and will be asked to analyse the quality of the teaching and learning that they observed. Various prompt questions will be given to inform their reflection.  \r\n\r\nPre –interview Task 2: \r\n\r\nApplicants will be asked to prepare a 20-minute section of a lesson on PowerPoint. During the interview, applicants will be invited to share how they would deliver each aspect of the lesson that they have planned. The title and learning outcomes for the lesson episode will be shared with applicants one week prior to the interview. \r\n\r\nPanel interview:\r\n\r\nThe interview will be conducted by the Director of WCTSA and a subject specific member of staff. It will include questions on the pre-interview tasks in addition to questions on safeguarding, knowledge and understanding of teaching and learning, education and experience.\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Trainees following the School Direct route into teaching are able to express a preference as to which of our partner schools they would like to be based in. This provides trainees with the opportunity to train close to home. Whilst most of our trainees are placed at Uffculme School, we also offer placements in our Exeter, Mid Devon or Taunton based schools. Our diverse and extensive partnership of schools ensures that we can tailor our placements to meet the needs of our trainees. This can also include offering trainees an enriched experience of post 16 teaching or an opportunity to teach in the independent sector.\r\n\r\nSchool Direct Distance trainees spend the Autumn and Summer Terms in their home school and have their contrasting placement during the Spring Term. In addition to this they will also have a one week cross phase placement in a Primary setting. Trainees who are not based in an 11 - 18 setting for one of their placements will also be provided with a one week post 16 experience. \r\n\r\nAll placements, including cross phase and post 16, are organised for trainees. \r\n\r\nThere will also be a small number of University led seminar days during the year.\r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for applicants who are passionate about teaching young people and who are driven by a desire to see every child succeed. Applicants should have a genuine love of their subject, they must be willing to learn and have the confidence to take risks. All trainees will need to possess resilience and above all they must be prepared to be reflective and learn from their experiences. \r\n\r\nOur trainees need to demonstrate that they have the potential to become outstanding teachers who are committed to teaching and to developing their own careers. \r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"In addition to the academic requirements listed, selection is based on performance at interview, a satisfactory fitness to teach assessment and a satisfactory DBS enhanced disclosure. Note: the DfE entry requirement to pass professional skills tests in literacy and numeracy has been removed for 2020/21 entry onwards.  Instead PGCE trainees will be benchmarked during their training against a Government-defined set of fundamental mathematics and English skills.\r\n\r\nAlthough not essential it would be an advantage to be able to reflect on any school-based experience or experience working with young people in another context at interview.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:47:31.769Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-09T09:32:22.264Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2024"}
