Our PGDipEd programmes include a significant amount of time spent on placements in a variety of schools at different locations within the West Midlands, and so when budgeting to study you should also allow for travel to and from placements, as well as textbooks, printing, photocopying and stationery that you may need.\r\n\r\n","aboutCourse":"This Science: Biology one-year PGDipEd (QTS) course prepares you for life as a science teacher, with a specialism in Biology. The course develops your skills and abilities in understanding the complexities which surround the teaching and learning of science; the subject knowledge and the pedagogy. We hope to develop you as a reflective teacher who considers carefully the choices in how to teach Biology and makes informed decisions about how you work best with students. \r\n\r\nAt the University of Birmingham we believe we should provide student teachers with the highest level of teacher training possible, and this is why we offer a Postgraduate Diploma in Education (PGDE also known as a PGDipEd) rather than a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE). Both qualifications lead to Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) but the PGDipEd also offers the equivalent of 120 credits towards a Master’s  degree, which makes it a highly rewarding course by combining both theory and practice.\r\n\r\nFollowing satisfactory completion of this course, plus a successful induction year in school and references, you can return to complete an MA in Teaching Studies. Additionally, the School also offers a number of specialised Professional Development programmes which will enable you to further develop your career.\r\n\r\n[Visit our course page to find out more](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/taught/edu/teacher-training-secondary-science-biology.aspx)","interviewProcess":"Selection is rigorous and designed to identify candidates with the strongest aptitude.

During the programme you benefit from both carefully supported introductory work in different schools and the experience of spending a significant length of time in two schools.\r\n\r\nThe final assessment of teaching is based on the spring/summer term school placement. Assessment is shared between University tutors, staff responsible for students in schools, and external examiners. All aspects of your contribution to the life of the school are taken into account, in particular the teaching of your main subject.\r\n\r\nDuring the course supervised experience and practice are arranged in schools of various kinds across the 11–18 age range. We are fortunate in being able to work with a wide range of partnership schools, including mixed comprehensives, single-sex schools, sixth-form colleges and our own University Training School (www.uobschool.org.uk). Many of the schools offer opportunities to work with pupils from a wide variety of cultural backgrounds.
