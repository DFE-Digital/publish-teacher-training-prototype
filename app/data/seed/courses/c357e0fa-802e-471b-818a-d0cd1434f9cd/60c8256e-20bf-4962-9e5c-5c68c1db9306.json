Our PGDipEd programmes include a significant amount of time spent on placements in a variety of schools at different locations, and so when budgeting to study you should also allow for travel to and from placements, as well as textbooks, printing, photocopying and stationery that you may need.","aboutCourse":"Our Mathematics PGDipEd (QTS) course received the top grade in all areas in the last Ofsted subject inspection. The course tries to develop a deep understanding of issues and complexities which surround the teaching and learning of mathematics. We wish to develop you as a thinking teacher who can be aware of choices in how to teach mathematics and make informed decisions about how you work with students.\r\n\r\nAt the University of Birmingham we believe we should provide student teachers with the highest level of teacher training possible, and this is why we offer a Post-Graduate Diploma in Education (PGDipEd also known as a PGDE) rather than a Post-Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE). Both qualifications lead to Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) but the PGDipEd also offers the equivalent of 120 credits towards a masters (out of 180 credits), which makes it a highly rewarding course by combining both theory and practice. \r\n\r\nFollowing satisfactory completion of this course, plus a successful induction year in school and references, you can return to complete an MA in Teaching Studies. Additionally, the School also offers a number of specialised Professional Development programmes which will enable you to further develop your career.\r\n\r\nFor those who have studied a degree with less than the 50% of mathematical content of an undergraduate mathematical degree as well as career changers we have the Subject Knowledge Enhancement (SKE) course, which is a full time, campus-based conversion course for those who wish to teach mathematics in secondary schools. \r\n\r\nPlease note that it is important to make an early application as demand is very high and places fill quickly.\r\n\r\n[Please view our course page to find out more](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/taught/edu/teacher-training-secondary-mathematics.aspx)","interviewProcess":"Selection is rigorous and designed to identify candidates with the strongest aptitude. Successful applicants will undertake an online interview where you will:\r\n\r\n* meet course tutors\r\n* find out more about the course\r\n* complete a written task (where relevant)\r\n* have a one to one interview\r\n* show GCSE and Degree certificates (where these are available).\r\n\r\nWe work closely with partner schools to select candidates and applicants will often have the opportunity to meet senior colleagues from partner schools when they join us for interview day.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"School-based work is an important part of the programme, with students normally spending a total of 24 weeks in schools. During the programme you benefit from both carefully supported introductory work in different schools and the experience of spending a significant length of time in two schools.\r\n\r\nThe final assessment of teaching is based on the spring/summer term school placement. Assessment is shared between University tutors, staff responsible for students in schools, and external examiners. All aspects of your contribution to the life of the school are taken into account, in particular the teaching of your main subject.\r\n\r\nDuring the course supervised experience and practice are arranged in schools of various kinds across the 11â€“18 age range. We are fortunate in being able to work with a wide range of partnership schools, including mixed comprehensives, single-sex schools, sixth-form colleges and our own University Training School (www.uobschool.org.uk). Many of the schools offer opportunities to work with pupils from a wide variety of cultural backgrounds.
