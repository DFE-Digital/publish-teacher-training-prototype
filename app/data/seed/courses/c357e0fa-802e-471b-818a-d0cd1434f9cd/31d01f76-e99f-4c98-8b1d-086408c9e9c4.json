Our PGDipEd programmes include a significant amount of time spent on placements in a variety of schools at different locations, and so when budgeting to study you should also allow for travel to and from placements, as well as textbooks, printing, photocopying and stationery that you may need.","aboutCourse":"The Science: Physics one-year PGDipEd (QTS) course is structured to develop a deep understanding of the pedagogy and didactics of Physics, grounded in practical competence in classrooms. You will be challenged to develop informed and justified decisions about how you approach your teaching, in order to enable you to continue to develop over your career. You will be expected to develop these insights, although in less depth, across all facets of the sciences. \r\n\r\nWe offer a Postgraduate Diploma in Education (PGDipEd also known as the PGDE) rather than a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) at the University of Birmingham, as we believe we should provide student teachers with the highest level of teacher training possible. Both qualifications lead to Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) but the PGDipEd also offers the equivalent of 120 credits towards a masters (out of 180 credits), which makes it a highly rewarding course by combining both theory and practice.\r\n\r\nOnce you have completed your PGDipEd and successfully passed your induction year, you may return to study with us on a part-time basis to complete your Masters in Teaching Studies. Additionally, the School also offers a number of specialised Professional Development programmes which will enable you to further develop your career.\r\n\r\n[Visit our course page to find out more](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/taught/edu/teacher-training-secondary-science-physics.aspx)","interviewProcess":"Selection is rigorous and designed to identify candidates with the strongest aptitude. Successful applicants will undertake an online interview where you will:\r\n\r\n* meet course tutors\r\n* find out more about the course\r\n* complete a written task (where relevant)\r\n* have a one to one interview\r\n* show GCSE and Degree certificates (where these are available).\r\n\r\nWe work closely with partner schools to select candidates and applicants will often have the opportunity to meet senior colleagues from partner schools when they join us for interview day.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"School-based work is an important part of the programme, with students normally spending a total of 24 weeks in schools. During the programme you benefit from both carefully supported introductory work in different schools and the experience of spending a significant length of time in two schools.\r\n\r\nThe final assessment of teaching is based on the spring/summer term school placement. Assessment is shared between University tutors, staff responsible for students in schools, and external examiners. All aspects of your contribution to the life of the school are taken into account, in particular the teaching of your main subject.\r\n\r\nDuring the course supervised experience and practice are arranged in schools of various kinds across the 11â€“18 age range. We are fortunate in being able to work with a wide range of partnership schools, including mixed comprehensives, single-sex schools, sixth-form colleges and our own University Training School (www.uobschool.org.uk). Many of the schools offer opportunities to work with pupils from a wide variety of cultural backgrounds.
