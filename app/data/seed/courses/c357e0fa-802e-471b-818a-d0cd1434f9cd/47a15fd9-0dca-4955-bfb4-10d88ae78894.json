This Primary Mathematics Specialist programme will enables you to develop your subject expertise within a primary context. You will learn to teach all the primary curriculum subjects, and will develop specialist expertise in mathematics.  The course lays the foundations for you becoming a future leader in mathematics. You will be prepared for employment in a generalist role at the start of your career, where you will ‘champion’ mathematics and inspire children and teachers.  The course also prepares you for employment in a more specialist role, teaching mainly or solely mathematics.\r\n\r\nWe are looking to recruit graduates with strong mathematics subject knowledge who demonstrate an enthusiasm for mathematics and an understanding of the primary context. \r\n\r\nThe programme offers the equivalent of 120 credits and these may be used towards our MA in Teaching Studies. Additionally, the School also offers a number of specialised Professional Development programmes which will enable you to further develop your career.\r\n\r\n[Visit our course page to find out more](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/taught/edu/teacher-training-primary-mathematics.aspx)","interviewProcess":"Selection is rigorous and designed to identify candidates with the strongest aptitude.

You will experience both Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2 during your training year, and you can express preference for phases, which we accommodate if we can.  You will also spend shorter Special Interest Placements in the Early Years Foundation Stage and in Key Stage 3.  These experiences will develop your understanding of progression in children’s mathematical learning and hence your leadership potential.\r\n\r\nOur partnership schools vary in size, phase and context, giving you the opportunity to broaden your teaching experience.
