Our specialist programme offers high quality training and support, which will prepare you to teach in the 3-11 age range and is run in close partnership with schools. Once you have secured a place on this Primary PGDipEd course, you will opt to specialise either as General Primary teacher (5-11 years) or as an Early Years teacher (3-7 years). Rated outstanding by Ofsted in 2013, this is a course which offers high quality training and support as well as excellent employment prospects.\r\n\r\nLike a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) the Postgraduate Diploma in Primary Education is a teacher training programme leading to Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) but it also offers the equivalent of 120 credits and these may be used towards our MA in Teaching Studies.  Additionally, the School also offers a number of specialised Professional Development programmes which will enable you to further develop your career.\r\n\r\n[Visit our course page to find out more](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/taught/edu/teacher-training-primary.aspx)","interviewProcess":"Selection is rigorous and designed to identify candidates with the strongest aptitude.
