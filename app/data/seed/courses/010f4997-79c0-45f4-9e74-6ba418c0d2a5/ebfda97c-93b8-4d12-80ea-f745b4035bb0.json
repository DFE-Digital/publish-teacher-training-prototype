Once the Apprentice is an ECT (Early Career Teacher) the end-point assessment (EPA) must be completed within three months. \r\n\r\nThe end-point assessment comprises of: \r\n\r\n* A lesson observation observed, and assessed, by the independent assessor. A short professional dialogue about the observed lesson will follow this;\r\n\r\n* A professional discussion, which will assess the apprentices’ knowledge, skills and behaviours with regard to the Teachers’ Standards. The professional discussion will be held between the apprentice and a panel, composed of the independent assessor, a representative from the apprenticeship training provider and a representative from the employer who has been involved in the apprentice’s training and development (such as professional mentor or support tutor). The apprentice should bring with them a portfolio of work completed during Initial Teaching Training. The portfolio will not be assessed but will provide the apprentice with an aid to the professional discussion.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Applicants are shortlisted by the training team according to a scoring system against our (person specification)[http://www.2schools.org/school-direct/what-are-we-looking-for/].\r\nand if successful are invited for interview. The interview lasts half a day and usually takes place at the lead school Oakthorpe Primary.\r\n\r\nIf successful at interview  candidates will be invited to the next stage in the interview process, which involves the delivery of a half hour literacy or maths session observed by one of the school's leaders and a member from the provider's management board. There will also be time spent in class and candidates will need to take our internally set maths and literacy tests. Maths will be at approximately KS3 level and literacy will be an extended writing task.\r\n\r\nApplicants who are successful at interview, are offered a conditional place. These are subject to:\r\n\r\n* Satisfactory references\r\n\r\n* Satisfactory medical assessment and Disclosure and Barring Service check (DBS)\r\n\r\n* National and Local Terms and Conditions of Employment\r\n\r\n* Satisfactory completion of between 1 and 5 days in one of our schools (this will depend on your experience)\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the additional days in school is to ensure that following the Apprenticeship with us is the right decision for both the candidate and the Consortium. It is also an opportunity for the Consortium to gain information about the candidate to inform the initial needs analysis and the setting of pre-course tasks.\r\n\r\nWe run information sessions to support applicants.
