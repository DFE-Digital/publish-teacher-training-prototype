Student Finance England will pay your fees direct to the University.\r\n\r\nYou don’t have to pay the loan back while you study. It will only be repayable when you have left the course and earn over £25,000 a year.\r\n\r\nWhen you enrol at the university they will ask you who will be paying for your fees and whether you have requested a loan. If you have not taken the loan, they will send you an invoice for the fees, which will require payment in full during the relevant academic year.\r\n\r\nIf you are an international student coming to study at the University,  please visit the International Fees and Finance pages for full details of tuition fees and support available.\r\n","financialSupport":"We will endeavour, where possible, to take geography and personal circumstances into account when organising school placements.  Trainees are expected to travel to the placement school and may be required to travel up to 60 minutes (public transport) from their residence.  Please be aware of potential associated travelling costs. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ","aboutCourse":"Our one-year PGCE Primary Education with QTS course will prepare you to teach in the 5-11 age range.  \r\n\r\nDuring the first stage you will spend time at university taking part in seminars and workshops that prepare you for your school-based training. These will focus on three main elements:\r\n\r\n*  Professional Educational Studies\r\n*  Subject knowledge and applied pedagogy\r\n\r\nYou'll be in school within the first few weeks of the programme and will spend your first extended period of time in school from October. Working alongside an experienced class teacher and mentor you will have the opportunity to put into practice what you’ve learnt so far, focusing on teaching English and Mathematics and one other curriculum area.\r\n\r\nDuring Stage 2 your University-based training will comprise the same elements as stage one, but you’ll focus on building on the knowledge you’ve already developed to prepare for your next school-based training block. In your second placement, you will develop your teaching skills further, usually in a new school, teaching a contrasting age phase to your first placement. You'll continue to focus on English and Mathematics, alongside PE and broader areas of the curriculum.\r\n\r\nDuring Stage 3 you’ll spend some time at University completing CPD activities that will prepare for your teaching career. These activities will include responses to current priorities in primary education, support for your first employment and optional enhancements to develop your professional profile. You’ll stay in the same school until the end of the programme, teaching another age phase. Putting everything you’ve learned into practice, you’ll teach all subjects and areas of provision in stage three. You will take on the role of the class teacher and will take on wider responsibilities across the school. You will continue to have coaching and mentoring from school staff.\r\n\r\nDuring each stage of school-based training, you will be formatively assessed and your progress mapped against formative targets. A summary judgment will be made at the end of each stage. This summary will provide you with further information about your areas of strength and targets to develop moving forwards. By the end of your training in school (Stage 3) you will be expected to have met the Teachers’ Standards and a Summative Assessment will be made using the standards as a bench mark. When you meet the Teachers’ Standards you are then recommended for QTS.","interviewProcess":"You will be shortlisted for interview based on your application. The interview process typically lasts for half a day. The following selection procedures are designed to assess your suitability to train to teach:\r\n\r\n*  You will be asked to prepare and lead an activity with a small group of children in one of our partnership schools\r\n*  You will complete tasks designed to evaluate your fundamental English and mathematical skills\r\n*  You will also have an individual interview with a member of the course team which will include a discussion about your curriculum knowledge. \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"School based training is a fundamental part of your initial teacher training.
