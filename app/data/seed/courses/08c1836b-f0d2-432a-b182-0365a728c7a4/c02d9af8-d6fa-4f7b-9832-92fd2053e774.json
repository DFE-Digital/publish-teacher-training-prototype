","aboutCourse":"The School Direct teacher training programme is a full time, one year Initial Teacher Education qualification introducing you to the requirements for teaching to the 11 – 16 age range.

The School Direct salaried programme allows you to work towards securing 30 Master's level credits. This is an integral part of the programme.

This is fostered in two modules and developed through School Based Training.
