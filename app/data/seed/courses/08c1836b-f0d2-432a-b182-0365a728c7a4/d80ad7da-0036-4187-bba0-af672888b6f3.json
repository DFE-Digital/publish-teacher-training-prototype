","aboutCourse":"The School Direct teacher training programme is a full time, one year Initial Teacher Education qualification introducing you to the requirements for teaching to the 11 – 16 age range. Where appropriate, opportunities to experience post 16 provision will be available. It has been designed to enable you to demonstrate evidence of having met the Teachers’ Standards that lead to Qualified Teacher Status. Whilst undertaking the School Direct unsalaried (PGCE) route into teaching you will work towards securing 60 Master’s level credits. The School Direct salaried programme allows you to work towards securing 30 Master's level credits. This is an integral part of the programme. We strongly believe that innovative and effective teaching and learning is made possible through a teacher’s full engagement with research informed practice and underpinning theories of learning. This is fostered in two modules and developed through School Based Training. You will be well supported in becoming a critically reflective teacher capable of inspiring pupils to learn, achieve and flourish.\r\n\r\nYou will be supported and taught by specialist tutors with excellent experience, knowledge and research informed expertise.
