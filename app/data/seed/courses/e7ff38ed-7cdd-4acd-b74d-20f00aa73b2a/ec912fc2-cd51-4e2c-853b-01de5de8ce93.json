Trainees must complete placements in both Key Stage One and Key Stage 2 for this training program.\r\n\r\nWe have a number of Specialist Leaders in Education who will support and contribute to the School Direct programme, thus enabling a bespoke programme tailored to student’s needs. In addition to this, students are supported by a Lead Mentor and outstanding practitioners.\r\n\r\nThe school-centred nature of the training programme means you will be based in two different primary schools for the majority of the academic year.

Serial visits to the school  are made in the build up in preparation of this.\r\n\r\nStage 2 and 3 are completed at a 'Home School'.  Stage 2 is 10 weeks long  where trainees  progressively begin to teach a broader primary curriculum beyond English and Maths. \r\nStage 3 is 10 weeks long, where trainees develop independence and confidence across all of the Teaching Standards, showcasing school readiness for their ECT year. Stage 3 is completed in a trainees preferred year group, where possible, in order to build upon existing strengths. \r\n\r\nConsideration of individual and geographical needs are always taken into account when allocating placement schools. We pride ourselves on this and consider it one of the  contributing factors to the excellent outcomes and successes of the training program.","personalQualities":"BWCAT PDP are committed to creating teachers of the future.
