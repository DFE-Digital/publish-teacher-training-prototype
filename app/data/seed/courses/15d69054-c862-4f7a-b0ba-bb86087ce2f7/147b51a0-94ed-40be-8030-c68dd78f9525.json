The course requires a study of academic literature and completion of professional assignments, alongside two school based placements. The course is designed to show that trainee teachers demonstrate that they have met the standards for Qualified Teacher Status. \r\nTraining to be a Drama teacher you will work with a team of experienced and inspirational teachers, who are prepared to share their knowledge with you. You will develop classroom skills, plan and deliver lessons across KS3 and GCSE.  You will be guided to improve your practice at every step. You will be able to get involved in the extra curricular activities of the Drama departments and see your students in new light.  \r\n\r\nYou receive a practice-led, hands on experience. Trainees are supported by a Subject Based Tutor within school, the Professional Tutor of the school, the Lead Subject Mentor from the NTTP SCITT, the Programme Facilitators.\r\nSubject Studies and General Professional Study sessions enhance your knowledge of teaching and learning and help to develop your pedagogy. Constant self-reflection allows trainees to assess their strengths and development potential, which should allow progression and confidence.\r\nDuring your placements you will teach pupils in the 11 to 16 age range. \r\n \r\nSubject Studies are delivered as twilight sessions and take place in the first half of the year so that you have the tools to succeed in your school placements. They are designed to illustrate ways to help you apply your knowledge and understanding in designing and teaching lessons. Sessions are delivered by your Lead Subject Mentor and other experienced teachers from within partnership schools. \r\nA selection of subject studies sessions are as follows in addition to in depth specialist training for Drama.\r\n\tPerformance in the Arts classroom\r\n\tCreativity in the Arts classroom\r\n\tAssessment  in the Arts classroom\r\n\tDrama in English\r\n\tDance subject Knowledge sessions\r\nDuring the selection process, you will complete a Subject Knowledge Audit. You will review this with your LSM at the start of the training year and it will become the starting point for your Individual Learning Plan 1 (ILP1) which will establish target areas for the development of your subject knowledge and application. Subject Studies sessions will help you to meet these targets, but will also be responsible for identifying and filling any gaps in your subject knowledge.","interviewProcess":"As with any interview, the key to success is preparation. Make sure you do your research into the course, as well as the issues surrounding education and teaching in general. Policies and practices change quickly, so your knowledge needs to be up to date.\r\nThe Interview process will entail: \r\n•\tAdministrative Questions \t\t\t\t-\t10 minutes\r\n•\tPresentation - “Why I want to become a teacher”\t-\t5 minutes\r\n•\tPresenting a ‘Starter’ of your choice\t\t\t-\t5 minutes\r\n•\tInterview \t\t\t\t\t\t-\t40 minutes\r\n•\tLiteracy written task\t\t\t\t- \t20 minutes\r\n•\tSubject Knowledge Task\t\t\t\t- \t30 minutes\r\n•\tPortfolio of work/video for Art and Performing Art subjects\r\n\r\nYour interviewers will be looking for you to demonstrate a number of qualities. You should therefore try to tailor your answers and contributions to reflect these qualities. They are:\r\n-\tA commitment to and understanding of secondary education and the role of the teacher\r\n-\tGood personal, intellectual and communication skills\r\n-\tA positive attitude towards children and working with children\r\n-\tAn enthusiasm for and understanding of your subject (s) and teaching in general.  \r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We have long-established partnerships and rewarding connections with a wide variety of secondary schools across the county.  Ideally, you will be required to spend a minimum of 12 weeks in two of our placement schools whilst on the course.  You will work closely with our trained school based tutors receiving weekly one-to-one meetings to monitor your progress throughout your first and second placement.\r\nTo qualify for QTS we will provide trainees with enough time in schools to demonstrate that they have achieved all the Teachers’ Standards.\r\nYou will train with pupils in the 11 to 16 age range, however in many of our partnership schools there will be the opportunity to experience Post 16 Education too.\r\nYou will be allocated to your placement school as a result of an initial induction and skills audit conducted early in the course.
