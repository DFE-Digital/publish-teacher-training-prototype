The course requires a study of academic literature and completion of professional assignments, alongside two school based placements. The course is designed to show that trainee teachers demonstrate that they have met the standards for Qualified Teacher Status. \r\nAll members of the PE department are experienced outstanding practitioners. They are heavily involved in helping NTTP to deliver a first class PGCE course to develop the next generation of outstanding Physical Education teachers. \r\nWhilst candidates may bring a particular expertise or specialism to the course, you will learn to teach all activity strands with confidence, improving your subject-specific knowledge, understanding and skills. You will be expected to be pro-active in identifying areas where further development is needed and in taking the appropriate steps to broaden and deepen your subject knowledge. \r\nYou will also have the opportunity to develop a range of lessons and teaching styles that cover the practical delivery and assessment of Physical Education at Key Stages 3, 4 and 5, where appropriate. These will be looked at during Subject Studies sessions.\r\nYou will receive a practice-led, hands on experience. Trainees are supported by a Subject Based Tutor within school, the Professional Tutor of the school, the Lead Subject Mentor from the NTTP SCITT, the Programme Facilitators.Subject Studies and General Professional Study sessions enhance your knowledge of teaching and learning and help to develop your pedagogy.

This is the best place to learn the art of teaching. The programme is designed to suit you, with your strengths nurtured and your areas for development targeted, improved upon and monitored. \r\nDuring your placements you will teach pupils in the 11 to 16 age range.\r\n \r\nSubject Studies are delivered as twilight sessions and take place in the first half of the year so that you have the tools to succeed in your school placements. Sessions are delivered by your Lead Subject Mentor and other experienced teachers. \r\nA selection of subject studies sessions are as follows: \r\nOrganising and Managing Physical Education lessons\r\nTeaching Gymnastic Activities, Athletic Activities, Invasion Games\r\nTeaching Net/Wall Games, Striking Games, Health & Fitness","interviewProcess":"As with any interview, the key to success is preparation. Make sure you do your research into the course, as well as the issues surrounding education and teaching in general. Policies and practices change quickly, so your knowledge needs to be up to date.\r\nThe Interview process will entail: \r\n•\tAdministrative Questions \t\t\t\t-\t10 minutes\r\n•\tPresentation - “Why I want to become a teacher”\t-\t5 minutes\r\n•\tPresenting a ‘Starter’ of your choice\t\t\t-\t5 minutes\r\n•\tInterview \t\t\t\t\t\t-\t40 minutes\r\n•\tLiteracy written task\t\t\t\t- \t20 minutes\r\n•\tSubject Knowledge Task\t\t\t\t- \t30 minutes\r\n•\tPortfolio of work/video for Art and Performing Art subjects\r\n\r\nYour interviewers will be looking for you to demonstrate a number of qualities. You should therefore try to tailor your answers and contributions to reflect these qualities. They are:\r\n-\tA commitment to and understanding of secondary education and the role of the teacher\r\n-\tGood personal, intellectual and communication skills\r\n-\tA positive attitude towards children and working with children\r\n-\tAn enthusiasm for and understanding of your subject (s) and teaching in general.

You will work closely with our trained school based tutors receiving weekly one-to-one meetings to monitor your progress throughout your first and second placement.\r\nTo qualify for QTS we will provide trainees with enough time in schools to demonstrate that they have achieved all the Teachers’ Standards.\r\nYou will train with pupils in the 11 to 16 age range, however in many of our partnership schools there will be the opportunity to experience Post 16 Education too.\r\nYou will be allocated to your placement school as a result of an initial induction and skills audit conducted early in the course.  Your placement school will be identified to meet your needs and therefore may not be your nearest school.\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":null,"otherRequirements":null,"status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:53:27.701Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-29T14:16:42.898Z","cycle":"2023","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"}
