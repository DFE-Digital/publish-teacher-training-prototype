You will spend four days a week in school and one day at university. Your subject mentor and professional mentor in school will support and develop you into the best classroom practitioner you can be; you will observe lessons and gradually teach classes. There is a clear focus on reflecting upon your practice to identify ways to further develop. Throughout the training year you will be formally observed, supported to teach and contribute to the wider context of the school. For example you will also have a tutor/mentor group. In partnership with the university, we will assess your progress against the Teaching Standards and support you to meet these across the year. At university you will work in subject groups and complete assignments as part of the course.","interviewProcess":"","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"During your training year, you will spend the majority of your time in one school and later in the year you will spend a shorter time in a second school. This is to give you a contrasting experience of schools and an opportunity to work with different learners and different practitioners from different schools. \r\n\r\nWe have several Secondary and Primary school partners in our alliance and are able to offer you the opportunity to really consider the school in which you’d like to spend your second placement. We will work with you to identify your developmental needs and match these against your second placement. The size of our alliance means that we are able to offer you the opportunity to train in different types of schools, all  of different sizes and in different settings. \r\n","personalQualities":"","otherRequirements":"","status":2,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:54:13.227Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2024"}
