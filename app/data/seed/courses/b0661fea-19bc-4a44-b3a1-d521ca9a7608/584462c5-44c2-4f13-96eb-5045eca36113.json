The PGCE carries 60 credits at Masters Level which could later contribute towards a Master’s Degree in Education (180 credits). Our programme is run in partnership with the University of Cumbria. Alongside school based training, you will also undertake two 30-credit masters level modules, to gain a PGCE taught by University of Cumbria lecturers, who work closely with our school direct programme team, to ensure that theory and practice are closely entwined to really inform your teaching and give you a useful toolkit to take forward in your career.\r\n\r\nIn summary, your PGCE course will usually include\r\n\r\n* 2 separate placements in  contrasting schools/colleges\r\n* 12 Pedagogy for Learning (PfL) days, an opportunity to specialise and enhance your subject knowledge and pedagogy. Usually at the University of Cumbria Lancaster Campus, they are spread over the year.\r\n* A block of training days before the start of each placement and once a week during the first term, delivered by experienced professionals, the majority of whom are outstanding practitioners in our alliance schools and colleges. \r\n* Two  modules connected to the PGCE, assessed by the submission of four written assignments, spread throughout the year, on teaching and learning in your subject and wider educational issues. \r\n\r\nTraining days, other than PfL days, will be delivered either at your principal campus, or at alliance providers in that area. Following current guidelines, we are delivering a ‘blended approach’ to learning, which combines ‘face to face’ sessions with opportunities for remote learning.","interviewProcess":"On the interview day we want you to demonstrate strong subject knowledge, display a passion for your subject, develop a positive rapport with pupils and have the ability to inspire learners.\r\n\r\nThe key parts of the interview day are: \r\n\r\n* A twenty-minute mini -teach. We will let you know the topic beforehand and you will teach a small group of pupils.  \r\n* Written tasks.
