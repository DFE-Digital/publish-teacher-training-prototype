The PGCE carries 60 credits at Masters Level which could later contribute towards a Master’s Degree in Education (180 credits). \r\n\r\nOur programme is run in an academic partnership with the University of Cumbria. Alongside school based training, you will also undertake two 30-credit masters level modules, to gain a PGCE. These modules are practically focused and titled ‘Raising the Achievement of Children’ and ‘High Quality Learning and Teaching’, both are designed to focus on your priorities and interests as you develop your teaching skills. They involve a total of 3 written assessments, one of which is a formative piece to support your academic development. These modules are taught by the University of Cumbria lecturers, who work closely with our school direct programme team, to ensure that theory and practice are closely entwined to really inform your teaching and give you a useful toolkit to take forward in your career. \r\n\r\nThe majority of your training will be delivered in school or at dedicated sessions in our Training Centre. You will benefit from the knowledge and experience of practising teachers and headteachers.\r\n","interviewProcess":"All of our interviews usually take place in a local school setting, led by our Primary Programme Lead.

Your rapport with the children will also be observed. \r\n\r\n* A discussion task that will allow you to demonstrate your awareness of the level of academic required when studying at this level\r\n\r\n* Interview - The final part of the process is an interview which will allow the interviewers to gauge your ability and potential to complete the course.\r\n\r\nWe will provide more structured information nearer the time of interview.\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"When you train with the Catholic Teaching Alliance your placements will be in Catholic schools from our alliance.
