The PGCE carries 60 credits at Masters Level which could later contribute towards a Master’s Degree in Education (180 credits). \r\nAlongside school based training, you will also undertake two 30-credit masters level modules, to gain a PGCE. These modules are taught by the University of Cumbria lecturers, who work closely with our school direct programme team, to ensure that theory and practice are closely entwined to really inform your teaching and give you a useful toolkit to take forward in your career.\r\n\r\nAs a summary, your PGCE course will include:\r\n\r\n* 2 separate placements\r\n* 12 Pedagogy for Learning (PfL) days when you will have the opportunity to specialise and enhance your subject knowledge and pedagogy in your own subject area.
