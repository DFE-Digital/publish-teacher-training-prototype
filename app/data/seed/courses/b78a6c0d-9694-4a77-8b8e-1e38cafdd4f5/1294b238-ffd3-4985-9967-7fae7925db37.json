A typical week is four days in school with one day at the training base.\r\n\r\nYorkshire Wolds Teacher Training (YWTT SCITT) was judged 'Outstanding' across all areas of its Ofsted report in October 2019.\r\n\r\nYWTT provides excellent training facilities with both primary and secondary simulated classrooms purposefully designed to enhance the programme delivery. YWTT provides a bespoke training experience for all our trainees and the Leadership has a wealth of experience and have a hands on approach to supporting all trainees to enable them to become the very best practitioners to ensure the next generation flourish.\r\n\r\nThe school-based element of the programme is largely taken up by two Teaching placements but there are also many other half and full-day visits to schools.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the award of QTS, trainees are able to gain a Post Graduate certificate in Education through Sheffield Hallam University which is delivered as part of the training programme at the Yorkshire Wolds Training base. The award of PGCE is separate to the award of QTS and, in order to achieve this, trainees must study for, complete and pass two assignments set and assessed by Sheffield Hallam University.","interviewProcess":"Competition for places is strong.\r\n\r\nSuccessful applicants will attend a selection day at one of our outstanding primary school partners.

This complements the role of the school mentor, who is able to monitor and assist the trainees’ development on a day-to-day basis.\r\n\r\nUniversity tutors and school mentors work closely in partnership with one another to ensure the best possible outcomes for all trainees.\r\n\r\nDuring the year trainees will have the opportunity to teach all primary curriculum subjects, with an emphasis on English and mathematics. The overall teaching load for the spring placement is 60-65%, with an increase in the summer to 70-75%. This provides a firm basis for the 80% teaching load during the NQT year.\r\n","personalQualities":"Personal qualities\r\nWe are looking for applicants with\r\n•\tA commitment to primary education\r\n•\tAn ability to motivate and inspire children of all abilities\r\n•\tEnergy and enthusiasm\r\n•\tEffective interaction with children\r\n•\tAn ability to work under pressure\r\n•\tPerseverance and flexibility\r\n•\tOral and written communication skills\r\n•\tThe ability to work co-operatively\r\n•\tAn awareness of current educational issues\r\n•\tA broad subject-knowledge base\r\n•\tReflection, self-evaluation and a willingness to learn\r\n•\tAwareness of what being a primary teacher entails\r\n","otherRequirements":"Successful applicants will undergo a DBS check.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:53:41.360Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-08T10:36:42.598Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2023"}
