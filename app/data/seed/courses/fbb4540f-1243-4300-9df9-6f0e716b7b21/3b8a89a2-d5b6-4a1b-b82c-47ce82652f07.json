You will gain a PGCE, QTS and 60 Masters credits. It is school-led, which means that the majority of your training is based in school. You will experience a full school year, and be immersed in daily life from the day you arrive in September. In doing so, you will have the opportunity to experience teaching as it really is, whilst working alongside, and being mentored by, outstanding practitioners. \r\nYou'll develop your knowledge of National Curriculum subjects in the primary curriculum with a focus on teaching and learning in the Early Years, Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2. \r\n\r\nCourse Structure\r\nThe course is a one year postgraduate certificate in primary education (3-11).

You will gain a deep understanding of issues related to inclusion as well as a critical understanding of educational policy. Other themes include how young people learn, behaviour management, assessment, and creative, innovative methods of teaching and learning. You'll research theories of child development, gain a greater understanding of current professional issues in primary education and develop your own educational philosophy.\r\n\r\nTeaching and Assessment\r\nYour training will incorporate school based practice with weekly professional learning delivered by Huddersfield University and excellent practitioners from within the alliance. Professional learning will take place in our well equipped primary training classroom at The Maltings in Halifax. At the training centre, you will work with a group of trainees from other Trinity Institute of Education schools, which will allow you time to collaborate, share good practice and engage in peer support.

The interview process typically lasts for a day. The following selection procedures are designed to assess your suitability for training to teach: \r\n- panel interview with members of the institute. \r\n- teach a 10 minute literacy or numeracy session to a class of children in one of our partnership schools. \r\n- complete a short Maths and English test to enable us to evaluate your skills.\r\nFrom this process we will see whether you have the passion, drive and skills to train to teach in one year.
