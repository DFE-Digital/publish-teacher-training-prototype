On the full time route the taught element is 36 weeks over a 9 month period.  You will spend approximately a third of the year training at the university and two thirds developing your teaching skills in two different schools.  The part time option is completed in two academic years and it is possible to undertake placements on a part time basis.\r\n\r\nUniversity tutors and students will contribute to your sessions in university where your development, progress and practical teaching skills will be assessed.  \r\n\r\nYour course will be based on the latest research and you will be encouraged to reflect on how this impacts your own teaching.\r\nYou will be introduced to the principles, research and theory on which good classroom practice is based.  Activities that might be included during your degree include modelling, role-play, lectures, seminars, discussion, school/educational setting visits and evaluation of classroom-based activities and resources. \r\n\r\nYou will be assessed by academic assignments and assessment of your teaching. Each of your modules is based on research which will enhance the education of your pupils . You will complete your own research projects which will help you develop as a teacher. \r\n\r\nThere are three modules: Subject Pedagogy, Professional Practice and Research and Enquiry in Education. Assessments will be:\r\n* Subject Pedagogy. You will be assessed by an individual presentation to an audience (50% of your mark) and a 2,000 word essay (50%)\r\n* Professional Practice. You will be assessed by an individual presentation which links theory and practice. You will use your evidence from professional practice to demonstrate that you have a critical understanding of a specific area in learning and assessment theories.

You will be assessed by either one 4,000 word essay (100% of your mark) or individual presentation (50%) and a 2,000 word literature review (50%)\r\n\r\nYou will be taught and supported by age-specific and subject experts with extensive experience in schools and other educational settings.
