The work of tutors is feeding into the [DfE National Centre of Excellence for Language Pedagogy](https://ncelp.org/), and underpins the internationally renowned [Professional Development Consortium in MFL](www.pdcinmfl.com), whose principles form the basis of the  course.  We have strong links to the Association for Language Learning and collaborate with such expert practitioners such as those at [The Language Gym](https://gianfrancoconti.com/2019/08/02/breaking-the-sound-teaching-learners-how-to-listen-why-we-wrote-it-and-what-it-is-about/).
