A passion for history is at the heart of what we do and is evident in all aspects of the training year.\r\n\r\nWe ensure that the right space and guidance is there for trainees who arrive with differing experiences of history and education so that everyone can develop the right subject knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge.\r\n\r\nSessions include:\r\n\r\n* how to teach pupils about causation, change and continuity, similarity and difference, and difficult concepts\r\n* how to develop pupils’ evidential thinking and chronological understanding\r\n* making big decisions about the curriculum, e.g. what history and whose history to teach and when to teach it. In order to do this, the history team work closely with mentors in schools, including school visits and training to ensure our high professional standards are maintained. \r\n\r\nThe tutor team are passionate about what they do, have a vast range of experience and have strong national and international reputations for their work, both as classroom history teachers and teacher trainers. During the year we draw on our numerous contacts and their expertise; we have leading history teachers contribute to sessions, and work with organisations such as the UCL Centre for Holocaust Education, the National Archives, and the Citizens Project at Royal Holloway. This ensures that your thinking and practice is informed by those at the leading edge of the profession.\r\n\r\nFurthermore we organise trips to consider history learning in different contexts, as well as the value of local history and leading effective trips. In 2020 our cohort spent days at Windsor Castle, where they drew upon the Royal Archives and an exclusive tour, and the Museum of English Rural Life.\r\n\r\nOur course combines research and practice from the very beginning, developed through a huge amount of classroom-based teaching and subsequent reflection, which has led to it receiving exceptional student evaluations and exemplary praise from external examiners.\r\n\r\n[More information about this course](http://www.reading.ac.uk/ready-to-study/study/subject-area/education-pg/pgce-secondary-education-history.aspx)","interviewProcess":"Interviews are currently being held online.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Placements enable you to develop the knowledge and skills valued and desired by employers - you will build your confidence in the classroom and gain practical teaching experience.
