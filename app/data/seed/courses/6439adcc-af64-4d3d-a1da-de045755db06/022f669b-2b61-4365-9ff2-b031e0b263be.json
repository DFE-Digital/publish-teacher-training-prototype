The programme proves a balance of reflective practice, analytic research and study, and current developments in music education. \r\n\r\nThe course allows for engagement with philosophies and pedagogies of music education, the development of approaches to delivering musical learning, and projects and opportunities to put such considerations into practice. \r\n\r\nWe pride ourselves on working closely with our partnership schools, and our team of mentors has the well-being and progression of our students at the heart of their work. \r\n\r\nWe work closely with a local primary school to address issues of transition from KS2-3, and spend time in a local school for pupils with SEND to more fully explore inclusivity in educational provision. We have a close partnership with Berkshire Maestros and work collaboratively to deliver singing, composition and performance workshops.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of our approach is that music teachers must be musicians as well as teachers. They must teach in a way that allows their pupils to develop their own musical understanding and use music as the target language for all that goes on in the music classroom.\r\n\r\nYour tutors are a diverse and incredibly experienced community of academics. You will be taught by experts in the field of music in education, and together you will examine a range of pedagogical approaches to music teaching.\r\n\r\nYou will learn in our purpose-built music and music technology studios with extensive resources of music, instruments and equipment. \r\n\r\nTeaching is through lectures, practical seminars and workshops, where interactive and discussion-based techniques will encourage you to engage, reflect and challenge. \r\n\r\nSessions may include:\r\n\r\n* participating in workshop style sessions with your peers\r\n* attending presentations by subject experts\r\n* working on tasks in groups\r\n* having individual tutorials\r\n* visits to schools or other education settings\r\n* visits to theatres, museums, galleries or sites of educational interest\r\n* writing assignments on aspects of subject teaching and Professional Studies\r\n\r\nThese learning activities will help you to develop a toolkit of knowledge and skills, ensuring you are well prepared to tackle challenges and opportunities throughout your training and your career.\r\n\r\n[More information about this course](http://www.reading.ac.uk/ready-to-study/study/subject-area/education-pg/pgce-secondary-education-music.aspx)","interviewProcess":"You will generally be interviewed by the Course Leader, and depending on the number of interviewees attending on a particular day, the schedule for the day will look something like that outlined below:\t\r\n\r\n1. An introduction to the music component of the course (group discussion, approx. 10 minutes)\r\n\r\n2. Each candidate will perform a 3-5 minute solo on their main instrument or voice to the group. This may be a piece in any style. There is no accompanist provided, so either perform an unaccompanied work, or bring a backing track on CD or other audio file.\r\n\r\n3. Each candidate will teach a song of their own choosing to the group. Choose a song suitable for classroom singing with year 7 students. The song may be in any style, and you may use a backing track or accompaniment, or sing a capella. The song must be a maximum of 3 minutes in performance. You will have 10 minutes to teach your song. \r\n\r\n4. Each candidate will be expected to realise a simple accompaniment to a folksong-like melody on the piano, guitar, ukulele etc. as if accompanying a class singing session.\r\n\r\n5. Individual interviews lasting approx. 20 minutes\r\n\r\n6.\tAt the same time, candidates will complete an individual written musicianship test to assess your staff notation reading and writing, and music analysis skills. \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Placements enable you to develop the skills and knowledge valued and desired by employers - you will build your confidence in the classroom and gain practical teaching experience.
