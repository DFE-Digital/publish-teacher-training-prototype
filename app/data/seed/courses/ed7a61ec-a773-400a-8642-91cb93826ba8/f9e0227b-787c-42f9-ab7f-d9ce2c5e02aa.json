You will be placed at your main placement academy for the majority of the year. We will work with you to agree a suitable placement which will be no longer than one hour and a half travel from your home.\r\n\r\nThroughout your training you will have a personal mentor, who is an experienced teacher, to oversee the school-based element of your training year. They will support you, be a model of effective practice, observe your teaching and meet with you weekly. \r\n\r\nThere will be regular advice and guidance on strategies to promote wellbeing and safeguard against instances of mental and physical ill-health. Support might take the form of 1:1 meetings with a Lead mentor or Wellbeing Officer or Intensive Practice on key areas e.g. behaviour management of children.\r\n\r\nYou will also benefit from a short second placement at a different partner school. This means you will experience teaching in a contrasting school to help you to develop your skills in a different context or age-range. We organise this based on a range of criteria to ensure an enriching school experience.\r\n\r\nDuring the course you will spend one day a week at Core Training. This will be a blended model of online and face-to-face sessions, based at our teacher training hub.  This is a school-centred, immersive programme where you will be teaching across the year, the rest of your week is spent in your school placements.\r\n\r\nOur Secondary courses cover 11-16. This means you will have experience across these age ranges. There are also opportunities for trainees to teach at Key Stage 5, if appropriate to their subject. \r\n\r\nWhen selecting your main school placement, we take into consideration the distance from your home, childcare or caring responsibilities, mode of transport and any other pertinent information. Please note, once you have accepted an offer, we are unable to make changes to the main placement school.","status":0}
