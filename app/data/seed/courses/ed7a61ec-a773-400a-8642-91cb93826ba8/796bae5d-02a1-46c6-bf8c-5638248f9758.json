As a trainee teacher, you’ll be based at one of our partner schools, where you’ll learn to teach alongside expert classroom practitioners in an exciting, vibrant environment. \r\n\r\nDuring the course you will spend one day a week at Core Training. This will be a blended model of online and face-to-face sessions, based at one of our regional campuses closest to you.  This is a school-centred, immersive programme where you will be teaching across the year, the rest of your week is spent in your school placements.\r\n\r\nThe training sessions are facilitated by our expert practitioners who will model outstanding planning, teaching and assessment to support your development as a teacher. You will have lots of opportunities to interact and learn from peers from across subjects and phases.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of Subject-specific training days as part of the Core Training which includes the following content as a minimum:\r\n\r\n*What makes a good geography lesson?\r\n*Understanding, progression and assessment in geography.\r\n*Geographical Enquiry\r\n*Fieldwork in geography \r\n*Geographical pedagogies \r\n*Using GIS in the curriculum\r\n*Literacy and numeracy in geography\r\n*Curriculum making \r\n*Recontextualising geographical knowledge.\r\n\r\nAssessment and Accreditation\r\n\r\n* The National Institute of Teaching (NIoT) programme leads to the award of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) through the NIoT (an accredited provider), with PGCE and Master’s Level Credits awarded in partnership with the University of Birmingham. \r\n\r\n* As a trainee teacher, you will be assessed holistically against the NIoT Curriculum, across the training year in both your school-based training and Core Training. By the end of the course, this will enable you to demonstrate that you have met the Teachers’ Standards as required for QTS. \r\n\r\n* The elements that make up the holistic assessment include: mentor reports; evidence of application in practice; subject and curriculum knowledge; completion of Intensive Training and Practice (IT&P) reflections; attendance and punctuality; professional behaviours; mathematics and English proficiencies; engagement and input in training and a final assessment panel presentation.\r\n\r\n* The PGCE element of the programme is assessed by: master’s level assignments; school experience.\r\nCourse arrangements and content may be subject to change in line with training partnerships with DfE requirements.","courseLength":"OneYear","salaryDetails":"If you are eligible for a salaried training place the programme fees will be met by the school.  \r\n\r\nYour salary will be calculated using the unqualified teachers' pay scales and the location of your school. \r\n\r\nPlease note you will not be eligible for any student finance on this route including maintenance loans. ","interviewProcess":"If your application is successful, we will invite you to the first stage of our interview process, a face-to-face interview with the NIoT Lead Mentors, which will consist of: \r\n\r\n* Two independent written tasks designed to assess your subject/phase knowledge and understanding of professionalism. \r\n\r\n* a panel interview with a 7-minute teaching episode and formal questions designed to assess your suitability to train to teach.  \r\n\r\n* an opportunity to ask any of your own questions.  \r\n\r\nWe will also be assessing your proficiency in English and collecting your documents at the face-to-face part of the interview process. \r\n\r\nPlease be prepared to bring any identification documents and original qualification certificates. \r\n \r\nWhen you apply to us, you are applying to the National Institute of Teaching@Inspiration Trust as a central provider for our region. We will select the most appropriate placement following a discussion with you at interview. Please apply for one location only.  \r\n\r\nIf you are successful in the first stage, we will organise a visit to your potential placement school (second stage) where you will meet with the Principal. \r\n\r\nFollowing this meeting, we will make you a formal conditional offer, which you will need to accept to secure your place on the course. You will then be sent a link to complete an online maths diagnostic assessment. \r\n\r\nAll offers are subject to the satisfactory completion of pre-programme checks including an Enhanced DBS and Prohibition Order checks, two suitable references and a Medical Questionnaire to assess your fitness to work. ","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"In order to ensure a well-rounded school-centred experience, you will undertake two school placements and four weeks of Intensive Training and Practice. You will be placed at your main placement academy for the majority of the year. We will work with you to agree a suitable placement which will be no longer than one hour and a half travel from your home.\r\n\r\nThroughout your training you will have a personal mentor, who is an experienced teacher, to oversee the school-based element of your training year. They will support you, be a model of effective practice, observe your teaching and meet with you weekly. \r\n\r\nThere will be regular advice and guidance on strategies to promote wellbeing and safeguard against instances of mental and physical ill-health. Support might take the form of 1:1 meetings with a Lead mentor or Wellbeing Officer or Intensive Practice on key areas e.g. behaviour management of children.\r\n\r\nYou will also benefit from a short second placement at a different partner school. This means you will experience teaching in a contrasting school to help you to develop your skills in a different context or age-range. We organise this based on a range of criteria to ensure an enriching school experience.\r\n\r\nDuring the course you will spend one day a week at Core Training. This will be a blended model of online and face-to-face sessions, based at our teacher training hub.  This is a school-centred, immersive programme where you will be teaching across the year, the rest of your week is spent in your school placements.\r\n\r\nOur Secondary courses cover 11-16. This means you will have experience across these age ranges. There are also opportunities for trainees to teach at Key Stage 5, if appropriate to their subject. \r\n\r\nWhen selecting your main school placement, we take into consideration the distance from your home, childcare or caring responsibilities, mode of transport and any other pertinent information. Please note, once you have accepted an offer, we are unable to make changes to the main placement school.","status":1}
