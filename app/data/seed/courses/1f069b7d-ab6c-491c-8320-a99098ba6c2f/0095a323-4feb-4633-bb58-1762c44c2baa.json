Each trainee will have their own experienced classroom practitioner within both schools, who will be assigned as their individual mentor. Central training will take place for secondary trainees one day a week at the ITT provider. \r\n\r\nFor the successful completion of the course, trainees must demonstrate competence against all the QTS standards, and need to have acceptable skills in numeracy and literacy, as set by the ITT Provider. Trainees will be continually assessed through lesson observations and placement reports whilst in their school.\r\n\r\nDetailed but functional files and portfolios of evidence are submitted for final assessment which will demonstrate how trainees have met the Standards for Qualified Teacher Status.
