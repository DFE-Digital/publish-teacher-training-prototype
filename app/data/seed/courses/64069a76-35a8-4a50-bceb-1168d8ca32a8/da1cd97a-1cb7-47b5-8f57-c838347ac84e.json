Ideally, you will also have a strong background in at least one other science at 'A' level. \r\n\r\nPhysics remains a popular choice for 'A' level students in schools. In addition to being a key component of Science in the National Curriculum it is also being offered as a separate GCSE option in many schools. STEM subjects are a national priority so physics teachers are in strong demand.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of subject and teaching knowledge and understanding is a priority and the team of science tutors includes specialists in physics, chemistry, biology and psychology teaching.\r\n\r\nStudents begin the programme with degree level knowledge of physics which is often quite specialised. Main Subject Physics sessions and Subject Support Groups, in which students teach each other about their own particular specialism within physics, are designed to help students develop their subject knowledge across all the aspects of physics that are relevant to the school curriculum.\r\n\r\nThe programme lasts for 39 weeks (one academic year). The course starts at the beginning of September students are inducted into TSW and spend one week in a primary school and one week in a secondary school and to carry out a variety of pre-course tasks. These include an initial needs analysis focussing on subject knowledge and a variety of reading tasks. The first term is predominately based at the University with an open-door policy to placement school one. The first placement then continues in January and lasts around 12 weeks. Induction into the second placement school takes place before the Easter vacation and then continues in the summer term until early July.\r\n\r\nRead \r\nhttps://www.exeter.ac.uk/teachertraining/secondary/science/physics/#qTPPj1zI7biZaPhh.99\r\nhttps://www.westst.org.uk/page/?title=Teach+South+West&pid=176","interviewProcess":"After successful application through UCAS, a candidate will be invited to be part of an online interview process which will involve formal interviews and a presentation/teaching episode.
