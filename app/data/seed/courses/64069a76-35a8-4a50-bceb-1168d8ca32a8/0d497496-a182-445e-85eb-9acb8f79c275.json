This involves examining a range of appropriate learning and teaching strategies through Key Stages 3-5 in the varied classroom situations you will encounter.  You will develop a rigorous understanding of when and where particular activities might be appropriate. The course is underpinned by the belief that history teaching is a stimulating, creative activity that gives pleasure to both teachers and pupils and educates young people to take a full and active role as citizens. The course draws heavily on current and recent research findings from both the Graduate School of Education and other researchers at the forefront of history education.\r\n\r\nTaught by a team of lecturers, active researchers and practicing classroom teachers from across the south west, the course relates theory to practice in all elements of the National Curriculum and 14-19 History.\r\n\r\nThe PGCE team’s current research interests lie in the areas of history and literacy, the impact that trainee teachers’ subject knowledge has on pupils’ learning in the classroom and how to personalise learning effectively.\r\n\r\nThe programme lasts for 39 weeks (one academic year). The course starts at the beginning of September students are inducted into TSW and spend one week in a primary school and one week in a secondary school and to carry out a variety of pre-course tasks. These include an initial needs analysis focussing on subject knowledge and a variety of reading tasks. The first term is predominately based at the University with an open-door policy to placement school one. The first placement then continues in January and lasts around 12 weeks. Induction into the second placement school takes place before the Easter vacation and then continues in the summer term until early July.\r\n\r\nRead more at https://www.exeter.ac.uk/teachertraining/secondary/history/#Dg1z3VlvT7RI2V51.99\r\nhttps://www.westst.org.uk/page/?title=Teach+South+West&pid=176","interviewProcess":"After successful application through DFE Apply a candidate will be invited to be part of an online interview process which will involve formal interviews and a presentation/teaching episode.
