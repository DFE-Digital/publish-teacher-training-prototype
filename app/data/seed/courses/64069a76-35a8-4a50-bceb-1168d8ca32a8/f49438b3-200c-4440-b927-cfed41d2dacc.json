The course enables you to explore the challenges that face both teachers and learners of the Spanish language in Britain today, the strategies for language acquisition in all its practical skills and the need for cultural awareness within the European dimension.\r\n\r\nThe University-based term offers a solid grounding in the communicative approach to language teaching, which also puts emphasis on language as structure, as recommended in the National Curriculum. This part of the course includes interactive, practical workshops and seminars, peer teaching and assessment, subject-specific lectures, small group work and discussions. The school-based terms are spent in dynamic MFL departments of a wide choice of schools across the South West.\r\n\r\nThe 2010 Ofsted inspection acknowledged the quality of the training provision by experienced practitioners and has been impressed by the coherent link established between the professional studies element and the MFL module as well as the high quality support given to students.\r\n\r\nProvision is made for students to develop competence in French or German as a second teaching MFL, and prospective trainees are required to have some grounding in one of these two languages prior to the start of the PGCE course. The use of Information and Communications Technology is developed to enhance the future teacher's own skills as well as to contribute to the preparation for effective MFL teaching in the 21st century.\r\n\r\nThe programme lasts for 39 weeks (one academic year). The course starts at the beginning of September students are inducted into TSW and spend one week in a primary school and one week in a secondary school and to carry out a variety of pre-course tasks. These include an initial needs analysis focussing on subject knowledge and a variety of reading tasks. The first term is predominately based at the University with an open-door policy to placement school one. The first placement then continues in January and lasts around 12 weeks. Induction into the second placement school takes place before the Easter vacation and then continues in the summer term until early July.\r\n\r\nRead more at https://www.exeter.ac.uk/teachertraining/secondary/mfl/spanish/#jR2ySD5FsPjUpbXK.99\r\nhttps://www.westst.org.uk/page/?title=Teach+South+West&pid=176","interviewProcess":"After successful application through UCAS, a candidate will be invited to be part of an online interview process which will involve formal interviews and a presentation/teaching episode.
