In addition to being a key component of Science in the National Curriculum, it is also being offered as a separate GCSE option in many schools. The PGCE Secondary Chemistry option provides a pathway into teaching for good chemistry graduates who, ideally, also have a strong background in at least one other science at 'A' level. It is designed to prepare students for teaching all aspects of science to at least Key Stage 3, and chemistry at GCSE and 'A' level.\r\n\r\nTopics covered include:\r\n\r\nthe aims of science teaching\r\nthe planning, preparation and evaluation of learning experiences for children of different ages and abilities\r\nschool laboratory management\r\nthe use of information and communications technologies to support science teaching and learning\r\nMore details about the types of sessions you will have and how you will be taught to teach can be found here.\r\n\r\nThe programme lasts for 39 weeks (one academic year).
