All of this is underpinned by a commitment to supporting you in your professional development so that you enter the profession as an enthusiastic and highly-skilled teacher.\r\n\r\nThe programme lasts for 39 weeks (one academic year). The course starts at the beginning of September students are inducted into TSW and spend one week in a primary school and one week in a secondary school and to carry out a variety of pre-course tasks. These include an initial needs analysis focussing on subject knowledge and a variety of reading tasks. The first term is predominately based at the University with an open-door policy to placement school one. The first placement then continues in January and lasts around 12 weeks. Induction into the second placement school takes place before the Easter vacation and then continues in the summer term until early July.\r\n\r\nOur aim is to help you to become a reflective practitioner, a teacher who is willing to critically evaluate and develop your practice in the light of experience and research evidence. You will be laying firm foundations for a thoughtful and rewarding teaching career. You will take part in activities that we hope will challenge your thinking and help you to develop a clear and positive rationale for your own values, beliefs and approaches.\r\n\r\nYou will also need to commit to a significant amount of independent study. As well as exploring your own professional development you will be asked to think about studentsâ€™ learning and how best to plan and organise lessons that allow all students to be active and successful. \r\n\r\nIn the first term of the PGCE year, based at the University, we will draw on your experiences, video material, whole group discussion, small group work, paired work, lectures, peer teaching and peer and self-evaluation to help you prepare for your school-based work in the following two terms. You will also complete two academic assignments during the year, in which you will explore aspects of learning and teaching mathematics in depth.\r\n\r\nWe will explore with you the nature of mathematics and the teaching of mathematics and how this might affect student enjoyment and engagement. \r\n\r\nRead more about the University aspects of the course at https://www.exeter.ac.uk/teachertraining/secondary/maths/#5PQc8cwhtJXiqfKX.99\r\nhttps://www.westst.org.uk/page/?title=Teach+South+West&pid=176","interviewProcess":"After successful application through DFE Apply  a candidate will be invited to be part of an online interview process which will involve formal interviews and a presentation/teaching episode.
