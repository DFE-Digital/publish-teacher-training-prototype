Our curriculum is carefully sequenced and considers what subject knowledge you’ll need to successfully teach PE – this builds cumulatively over the year through three phases and results in excellent outcomes.\r\n\r\nOn this course, we nurture your potential, not only in progressing towards a teaching qualification but in your confidence, competence, and ability to achieve a successful career.\r\n\r\nThere is an extensive programme of subject-specific University sessions together with teaching placements in schools with whom we have strong partnerships. This provision ensures teachers have a deep understanding of the complexities which surround education while being aware of the many ways to promote learning through PE. Trainees secure teaching posts having a breadth of subject knowledge and pedagogic experience which can be applied to motivate and engage young people. They feel prepared to respond to the diverse needs and life experiences of individuals and see themselves as part of the wider school community. On completion of the course, trainees are confident in engaging with colleagues and external organisations to develop pedagogy and drive educational change.\r\n\r\nExample of opportunities for enhancement within the course may include:\r\n\r\n* PE exclusive second subject enhancement activities.\r\n* Additional placements with specific focuses on EAL, SEND, ethnic minorities and post 16 teaching.\r\n* Further access to a wide range of coaching awards and qualifications at reduced costs.
