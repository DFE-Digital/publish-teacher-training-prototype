The spirit of collaboration is central to the ethos of the course and supports trainees to develop their practice.\r\n\r\nDuring the course, trainees are encouraged to explore a range of strategies for teaching within their specialist areas of design and technology (food) and food preparation and nutrition. There will also be opportunities during school placements for trainees to gain experience in other material and curriculum areas to enhance their employability.\r\n\r\nThe overall aim of the course is to equip trainees to meet the professional expectations of their early years in teaching and to give them a firm grounding for future professional development.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the course trainees will:\r\n\r\n* understand the nature of the subject in schools and have developed confidence and expertise in teaching design and technology and food preparation and nutrition.\r\n* have developed an understanding of recent curricular developments in the subject.\r\n* have developed an understanding of the latest examination specifications and expertise in planning and delivering lessons that meet these.\r\n* have developed practical classroom management skills; including the selection, development and use of a wide variety of resources and teaching strategies and addressing the significant health and safety issues that arise when teaching a practical subject.\r\n* know how to assess the subject and ensure that pupils are able to make progress, as well as knowing how to record and report on this progress.\r\n* know how to respond to pupils’ individual needs and develop a critical awareness of their own performance based upon evidence gained from a variety of sources.\r\n\r\nA design and technology (food) subject knowledge enhancement course is available prior to the commencement of the course.\r\n\r\nVisit our website to find out more: [https://www.worcester.ac.uk/courses/pgce-secondary-design-and-technology-food](https://www.worcester.ac.uk/courses/pgce-secondary-design-and-technology-food)\r\n\r\nYou will be trained to teach 11-16 with post 16 enhancement.","interviewProcess":"The selection process:\r\n\r\nTrainees are recruited through a rigorous selection process.
