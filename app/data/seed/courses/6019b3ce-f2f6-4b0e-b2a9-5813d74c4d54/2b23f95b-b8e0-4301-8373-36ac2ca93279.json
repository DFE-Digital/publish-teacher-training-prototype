Employment figures are very high because the course is highly regarded by schools. Trainee teachers work in many areas of subject pedagogy, developing their own approaches and benefiting from the expertise of experienced and active subject tutors.\r\n\r\nTraining at subject sessions includes workshops on teaching Shakespeare, poetry, novels, creative writing, assessment, grammar and media. These activities are accompanied by sessions on post-16 teaching, literacy and numeracy, adaptive teaching in the English classroom and the development of evaluation of learning. Behaviour management threads through all sessions and is seen as a branch of learning management as we model teaching scenarios upon which to reflect.\r\n\r\nAll sessions are highly active with strong input from tutors leading to exploration and creativity in group and individual work. There are many additional features of the course, for example, drama workshops, GCSE marking sessions, A level lectures at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust in Stratford and a focus on reading for pleasure at a leading educational bookshop.\r\n\r\nThere is an opportunity for reflective work with peers and a visit to partnership primary and secondary schools. Trainee teachers are well supported in university by their English tutors and through close partnerships with placement schools and mentors.\r\n\r\nAn English subject knowledge enhancement course is available to anyone who would benefit from updating their English knowledge. This will be discussed with you at interview.\r\n\r\nVisit our website to find out more: [https://www.worcester.ac.uk/courses/pgce-secondary-english](https://www.worcester.ac.uk/courses/pgce-secondary-english)\r\n\r\nAge range:\r\nYou will be trained to teach 11-16 with post 16 enhancement. \r\n\r\nCareer opportunities: An integral part of the course is to support you in gaining a post as a teacher.

Employment rates over the past 5 years have consistently been 95%+. At the end of the course we will support you in your transition from the PGCE year into your first teaching post, and beyond.\r\n\r\nAssessment: You will be assessed on your teaching practice and two academic assignments. One assignment requires you to generate some teaching resources that will help pupils to learn a particular topic and the second assignment will engage you in reviewing the teaching strategies that are effective in your subject.","interviewProcess":"The selection process: Trainees are recruited through a rigorous selection process.
