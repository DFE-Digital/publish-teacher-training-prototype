Travel costs are at your own expense but we do encourage car sharing. In addition there is sometimes a fee but this is not normally more than £20 in total.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we encourage you to join subject specific associations.

To support this we will explore a wide range of strategies for teaching history to all abilities in the 11-16 age range, with post-16 enhancement. We will also devote time to considering why we teach history and what history we teach to our pupils. All history teachers need a clear rationale and purpose to inform their teaching. This course sets out to help you find your vision for history teaching.\r\n\r\nThe overall aim of the course is to equip students to meet the demands of their early years in teaching and to give them a firm base for professional development. They will:\r\n\r\n* Understand the nature of the subject in professional terms and develop confidence and expertise in teaching history.\r\n* Develop an understanding of curricular developments affecting history, in particular the National Curriculum for history along with GCSE and A-level specifications.\r\n* Acquire practical classroom skills; select, develop and use a wide variety of resources and teaching strategies.\r\n* Develop an awareness and understanding of pupils’ achievements and difficulties and become familiar with the use of a range of assessment techniques to assess, record and report on the progress of pupils.\r\n* Develop a sympathetic response to pupils’ individual needs and a critical awareness of their own performances based upon evidence gained from a variety of sources.\r\n* Have opportunities to develop skills in planning learning outside the classroom activities.\r\n\r\nIt is recognised that students undertaking the course will have different backgrounds. Some will have completed their first degrees immediately prior to commencement of the course, some will already have some experience working in schools, whilst others may be undertaking a career change. We all benefit from this diversity of experience as each person brings their own perspectives and experiences to the course. Peer group support and discussion is integral to course.\r\n\r\nVisit our website to find out more: [https://www.worcester.ac.uk/courses/pgce-secondary-history](https://www.worcester.ac.uk/courses/pgce-secondary-history)\r\n\r\nYou will be trained to teach 11-16 with post 16 enhancement.\r\n\r\nAssessment: You will be assessed on your teaching practice and two academic assignments. One assignment requires you to generate some teaching resources that will help pupils to learn a particular topic and the second assignment will engage you in reviewing the teaching strategies that are effective in your subject.","interviewProcess":"The selection process: Trainees are recruited through a rigorous selection process.
