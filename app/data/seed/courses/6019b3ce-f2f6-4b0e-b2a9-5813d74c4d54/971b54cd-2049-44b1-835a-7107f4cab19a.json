Employment rates over the past 5 years have consistently been 95%+. At the end of the course we will support you in your transition from the PGCE year into your first teaching post, and beyond.\r\n\r\nAssessment:\r\n\r\nYou will be assessed on the basis of course work including written assignments, a resource task and an oral presentation of a small research project, as well as on your teaching practice.","interviewProcess":"The selection process:\r\n\r\nTrainees are recruited through a rigorous selection process.
