This takes place in a diverse, secular school and enables trainees to teach children from a variety of cultures and backgrounds. \r\nIn each school placement, trainees build up gradually their teaching and are supported by experienced mentors in school. They are also visited regularly by their own LSJS Professional Tutor who is responsible for monitoring their progress during school experiences.\r\n","personalQualities":"","otherRequirements":"","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-10-05T08:49:53.668Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-05T08:50:14.113Z"}
