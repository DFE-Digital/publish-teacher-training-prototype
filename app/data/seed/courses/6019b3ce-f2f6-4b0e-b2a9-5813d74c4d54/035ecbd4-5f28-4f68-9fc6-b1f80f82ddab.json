Trainees are encouraged to experiment with, apply, discuss, debate, compare and question current research-informed ideas. They work collaboratively to consolidate their subject knowledge and their understanding of pedagogy in the subject. \r\n\r\nTrainees work with trained school mentors from partnership schools who contribute to University subject sessions (teaching grammar, working with disadvantaged pupils and using data sensibly), they discuss and debate subject-specific approaches to pedagogy with their mentors in school. \r\n\r\nTrainees also take part in exciting projects and cross-curricular sessions with trainees from different PGCE subjects.\r\n\r\nThis includes:\r\n\r\n* taking part in the European Day of Languages in a secondary school\r\n* contributing to cross-curricular days organised in University and working with trainee teachers from different subject specialisms (English, Geography, History, Mathematics and Religious Studies).\r\n* planning a cross-curricular lesson collaboratively with primary trainee teachers and team-teaching it at a primary school.\r\n\r\nInternational and UK applicants are welcome. We have support systems in place to help all trainees write assignments at Master’s level and additional targeted support for international trainees. Modern Languages trainees get regular opportunities to work on their subject knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe UK Government has confirmed that EU students starting their course after August 2021 will no longer pay the home rate for fees or be eligible for undergraduate, postgraduate and advanced learner financial support from Student Finance England. However, at the University of Worcester we have decided that (with the exception of the Medicine MBChB), during this period of transition, EU students starting their studies in the academic year 2022/23 will continue to be eligible for the home rate of fees.\r\n\r\nIf you do not have experience of the English education system you will be invited to attend a pre-course induction day.\r\n\r\nVisit our website to find out more: [https://www.worcester.ac.uk/courses/pgce-secondary-modern-languages](https://www.worcester.ac.uk/courses/pgce-secondary-modern-languages)\r\n\r\nAssessment:\r\nYou will be assessed on your teaching practice and two academic assignments. One assignment requires you to generate some teaching resources that will help pupils to learn a particular topic and the second assignment will engage you in reviewing the teaching strategies that are effective in your subject.","interviewProcess":"The selection process: Trainees are recruited through a rigorous selection process.
