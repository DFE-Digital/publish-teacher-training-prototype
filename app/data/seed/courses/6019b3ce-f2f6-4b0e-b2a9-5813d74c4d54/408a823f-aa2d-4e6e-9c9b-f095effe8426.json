The course is available as a single language course in French, as well as the following combinations: French with German; French with Spanish; German with French; and Spanish with French.\r\n\r\nThe PGCE course in Modern Languages is an integrated programme of University and school-based work. University sessions are designed to help you reflect on a wide range of areas, which include: learning how to plan and deliver an engaging curriculum; how to manage young people's behaviour constructively; how to monitor and assess their progress; how to encourage them to carry on studying a modern language beyond Key Stage 3; and how to meet their needs. You will learn how to make a positive difference to young people's experiences of learning modern languages.\r\n\r\nIn addition, you will be involved in exciting projects throughout the year. For example:\r\n\r\n* taking part in the European Day of Languages in a secondary school\r\n* learning about the Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) methodology\r\n* contributing to cross-curricular days organised in University\r\n* planning a cross-curricular lesson collaboratively with primary trainee teachers and team-teaching it at a primary school \r\n\r\nInternational as well as UK applicants are welcome.

Our partner schools provide a range of settings from rural to inner city. Most schools are within a 30 mile radius of the University. You will practise teaching in at least two schools. \r\n\r\nThe course is designed with periods in University to give you the opportunity to reflect on your future development. Former trainees have made positive comments on the balance between theory and practice, carefully structured sessions, tutors' commitment to supporting trainees and trainees supporting each other and sharing good practice. \r\n\r\nIn each school you will be supported by a Professional Mentor, as well as your Subject Mentor.

At interview you may meet teachers from our partnership schools as they take part in the selection process alongside University tutors. ","personalQualities":"We are looking for trainees who are: \r\n\r\n* skilled and inspirational subject specialists\r\n* confident and reflective practitioners\r\n* effective communicators who can work in partnership\r\n* informed intellectuals who promote a love of learning\r\n* resilient professionals able to demonstrate high standards of personal conduct\r\n\r\nSchool experience is desirable, but not essential prior to an interview.

","otherRequirements":"Health and Physical Capacity to Teach:\r\nThe DfE requires all trainees to satisfactorily complete a medical questionnaire to demonstrate their fitness to teach.
