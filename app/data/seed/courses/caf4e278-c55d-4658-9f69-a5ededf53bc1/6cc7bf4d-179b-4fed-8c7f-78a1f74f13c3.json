You may be a recent graduate in Theology, Religious Studies (or in a related degree) or you may have worked in a range of occupations prior to commencing the course which will have provided you with an opportunity to develop your subject knowledge and wider experience of education and work. Whatever your background, you will have a love of beliefs, values and cultures with an enthusiasm for and a passion for conveying this to pupils and students.\r\n\r\nRE is a core NC subject (once adopted by the local Statutory Advisory Committee for Religious Education into a Locally Agreed Syllabus using the non-statutory guidance) but that apart, it is a multifaceted, fascinating and potentially contentious subject which allows considerable scope for the autonomy and personal qualities of the individual teacher. These facts are recognised in the course which encourages you to question the nature of the subject, to explore priorities and to develop constructive means for meeting the needs and interests of your pupils. You will consider the results of recent and relevant research and meet tried and tested teaching and learning strategies and programmes but, as importantly, you will be encouraged to develop your own ideas and strategies. All aspects of the subject are addressed during the course, including meeting the requirements of the Locally Agreed Syllabus and national initiatives such as Assessing Pupil Progress (APP) and Assessment for Learning (AFL), and with focused study of Religious Education at post-16 you will not only be equipped to teach pupils and students in the 11-16 age range but will have opportunities to gain experience of teaching at the 16-19 level.\r\n\r\nThrough mostly practical workshops and seminars, the course considers meaningful contexts for the teaching of RE including using a range of religious texts, use of places of worship for learning, thematic and subject-specific focuses, questioning skills and using Philosophy for Children (P4C) approach, using symbol for concept lead topics, tackling difficult and contentious issues, and affirming beliefs for those belonging to a faith and those who do not.   Key models for the teaching of RE are analysed and different styles of teaching are explored, you will be encouraged to read widely and to employ ICT, role-play and audio-visual aids such as electronic whiteboards in the classroom.\r\n\r\nThese sessions are delivered at Keele University.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Our selection process is a two way process where you can find out if the OAKS is the training programme for you and we can decide if you can potentially become a good/outstanding secondary teacher.  We always carry out our interviews in one of our partnership schools, where you will be expected to teach either a class or a small group of their students for 15 minutes.  The students give us feedback on your lesson, which we share with you during a formal interview.  This focuses on your lesson, your subject knowledge and your commitment to teach.  There are also written tasks for you to complete; these include a written subject specific activity and a generic writing task.  The whole process should take no more than half a day at the school.  You are interviewed by partnership school staff and OAKS tutors, who will talk through the programme and school placements. There will always be plenty of time for you to ask questions and the decision as to whether you are accepted on to the course is usually made on the same day (this may vary depending on the subject/time of year).\r\n\r\nWe want the interview to be a very positive experience for you. Please arrive promptly and formal dress is expected.  We look forward to meeting you!\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We will send you to two secondary schools where you will receive an 11-16 experience; the time spent in both of these placements is the same.  Hopefully they will give you two very different experiences; one maybe in a small town or rural setting the other could be inner city.  We make sure that you also receive a pre and post phase enhancement so you will be placed in a primary school for one week and gain experience in a post-16 environment (possibly in one of your secondary placements).  We are very proud of our alternative education placements that we arrange for you on our programme.  Hopefully you will gain experience in an EAL school, pupil referral unit (PRU), special school and maybe an independent school.  \r\n\r\nTravel to and from your placements is always a key concern and we make every effort to make sure that you can easily commute to your schools.  We have a very large partnership in over five counties; one will have schools close to you.  We guarantee that you will never have to travel more than 75 minutes.  In fact, most of our trainees travel well under an hour to their teaching experiences.  When we visit our EAL schools we put on mini buses so nothing could be simpler.\r\n\r\nMany of you will have applied to one of our 5 hubs (geographical zones); this usually dictates the schools that you will be placed in.  Through evaluations all of our partnership schools are deemed to be at least \"very good training experiences\" for our trainee teachers.  We train and then monitor all of our school based mentors and the quality of our school’s provision annually; so rest assured that you will have a good teaching experience with us at the OAKS.\r\n","personalQualities":"* Highly motivated individuals who want to make a positive contribution to the education of young people.       \r\n* Trainees who are passionate about their own specialism subject, with very good subject knowledge.  \r\n* Who are able to inspire their learners and create an environment where everyone wants to succeed.       \r\n* Candidates that show enthusiasm and a willingness to participate in the all aspects of the training course.       \r\n* Robust, resilient applicants who want to make a difference in the classroom.       \r\n* People who want to become good or outstanding classroom practitioners, with a desire to improve themselves and their student's.\r\n","otherRequirements":"* a medical report which is deemed satisfactory;\r\n* a completed DBS enhanced disclosure which is deemed satisfactory by the The OAKS;\r\n* a successful completion of a minimum of 10 days teaching experience in a secondary school/college during the last two years. This could be either before or after selection (undertaking this before the selection process commences will strengthen your application).\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:48:27.343Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-28T13:11:35.061Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2023"}
