Whatever your background, you must have a passion for sport; an enthusiasm for physical fitness and a strong desire for conveying this to pupils.\r\n\r\nP.E. is a compulsory element of education that enables everyone to take part and reach their own level of engagement. For many a high-quality physical education should engage and inspire pupils to develop a desire to be fit and healthy and their talent as young sports people, and so increase their self-confidence, fitness and sense of achievement. As pupils progress, they should develop their own skills and techniques in a large number of games (including football, cricket, netball, hockey, tennis and badminton, etc.), gymnastics and maybe swimming and dance.\r\n\r\nHaving an identity as a physical educator, and the ability to aid coaching of the many sports and related activities, as well as giving up many hours for clubs and school teams are essential to a successful PE teacher. You will build on your existing skills as a sportsperson and develop your subject knowledge in areas of weakness. You should be open to experiencing different styles and a large number of sports, some of which may well be totally new to you, and be prepared to also teach GCSE, BTEC PE and A level theoretical PE and maybe a second subject at Key Stage 3.\r\n\r\nAn important part of the course is learning to create a stimulating and caring environment. To help create such an environment, you need to be enthusiastic and lessons need to be well planned and related to the needs of pupils; not everyone enjoys sport!  You will be able to prepare in advance for handling different situations, develop strategies for maintaining discipline and managing the learning in an outdoor and sports hall environment.\r\n\r\nKey models for the teaching of PE are analysed and different styles of teaching are explored. You will be encouraged to read widely and to employ ICT to record and target improved sporting technique, demonstrations and warm ups, drill/activities as well as effective plenaries and self-assessment.\r\n\r\nThese sessions are delivered by a PE Subject Expert in Schools, therefore you are required to travel to Stoke for the delivery of these sessions.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Our selection process is a two way process where you can find out if the OAKS is the training programme for you and we can decide if you can potentially become a good/outstanding secondary teacher.  We always carry out our interviews in one of our partnership schools, where you will be expected to teach either a class or a small group of their students for 15 minutes.  The students give us feedback on your lesson, which we share with you during a formal interview.  This focuses on your lesson, your subject knowledge and your commitment to teach.  There are also written tasks for you to complete; these include a written subject specific activity and a generic writing task.  The whole process should take no more than half a day at the school.  You are interviewed by partnership school staff and OAKS tutors, who will talk through the programme and school placements. There will always be plenty of time for you to ask questions and the decision as to whether you are accepted on to the course is usually made on the same day (this may vary depending on the subject/time of year).\r\n\r\nWe want the interview to be a very positive experience for you. Please arrive promptly and formal dress is expected.  We look forward to meeting you!\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We will send you to two secondary schools where you will receive an 11-16 experience; the time spent in both of these placements is the same.  Hopefully they will give you two very different experiences; one maybe in a small town or rural setting the other could be inner city.  We make sure that you also receive a pre and post phase enhancement so you will be placed in a primary school for one week and gain experience in a post-16 environment (possibly in one of your secondary placements).  We are very proud of our alternative education placements that we arrange for you on our programme.  Hopefully you will gain experience in an EAL school, pupil referral unit (PRU), special school and maybe an independent school.  \r\n\r\nTravel to and from your placements is always a key concern and we make every effort to make sure that you can easily commute to your schools.  We have a very large partnership in over five counties; one will have schools close to you.  We guarantee that you will never have to travel more than 75 minutes.  In fact, most of our trainees travel well under an hour to their teaching experiences.  When we visit our EAL schools we put on mini buses so nothing could be simpler.\r\n\r\nMany of you will have applied to one of our 5 hubs (geographical zones); this usually dictates the schools that you will be placed in.  Through evaluations all of our partnership schools are deemed to be at least \"very good training experiences\" for our trainee teachers.  We train and then monitor all of our school based mentors and the quality of our school’s provision annually; so rest assured that you will have a good teaching experience with us at the OAKS.\r\n","personalQualities":"* Highly motivated individuals who want to make a positive contribution to the education of young people.       \r\n* Trainees who are passionate about their own specialism subject, with very good subject knowledge.  \r\n* Who are able to inspire their learners and create an environment where everyone wants to succeed.       \r\n* Candidates that show enthusiasm and a willingness to participate in the all aspects of the training course.       \r\n* Robust, resilient applicants who want to make a difference in the classroom.       \r\n* People who want to become good or outstanding classroom practitioners, with a desire to improve themselves and their student's.\r\n","otherRequirements":"* a medical report which is deemed satisfactory;\r\n* a completed DBS enhanced disclosure which is deemed satisfactory by the The OAKS;\r\n* a successful completion of a minimum of 10 days teaching experience in a secondary school/college during the last two years. This could be either before or after selection (undertaking this before the selection process commences will strengthen your application).\r\n* you must hold at least one coaching certificate and continue to participate in your chosen sport or recently represented at regional or national level.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:48:27.589Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-28T13:07:32.401Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2023"}
