programme is a school-based model of teacher training where student teachers are based in a school within the partnership for an academic year.

There is also the opportunity to work at another contrasting school within the partnership for a 6 week placement.\r\n\r\nThe programme covers all the National Curriculum subjects, and in each curriculum area, you will have the opportunity to develop understanding of the teaching and learning process, and to learn about effective classroom practice. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the work in classrooms and the academic studies, student teachers will benefit from a professional studies programme.  It is designed to provide school-focused learning with a particular spotlight on practical issues for trainees in their everyday practice.  Student teachers will have the opportunity to visit a variety of other schools in the partnership, to learn about different approaches to teaching and learning, and some chances to reflect on their learning and progress on the School Direct programme.\r\n\r\nStudent teachers will be provided with a variety of support across their training year including both a school and university based mentor who will work with the student teacher to develop a bespoke developmental plan to improve teaching practice.\r\n\r\nThis programme offers a PGCE with QTS and is assessed through observations of classroom competency, evidence to show the ability to meet the Department for Education Professional Standards as well as a series of academic assignments.\r\n\r\nThe school-based mode of teacher training offered through the John Donne Partnership is a dynamic programme of practical learning and academic study which allows student teachers to develop their skills and prepares them for their teaching career. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Successfully shortlisted candidates will be invited to virtual interview which will comprise the following activities:\r\n\r\n* An interview with a selection of senior staff from the partnership schools\r\n* A group discussion around an educational quote\r\n\r\nIf successful through this process candidates will be invited to one of the schools in the partnership to complete the following:\r\n\r\n* A 20 minute teaching task with a small group of children\r\n* A written task, reflecting on the teaching task\r\n* A maths check","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Student teachers will be based at one school within the partnership for the duration of their training.
