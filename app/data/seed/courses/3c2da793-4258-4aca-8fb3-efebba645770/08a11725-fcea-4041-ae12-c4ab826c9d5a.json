We therefore ask trainees for their preferences of placement schools, which we have found works very effectively.\r\n\r\nYou will have a base school (and class) from September to Christmas. In January you move to a different school and key stage for 6 weeks for a swap over placement. This is followed by enrichment placements such as SEN and EAL, depending on your previous experience. You then return to your base school (and class) for the remainder of the year.","personalQualities":"","otherRequirements":"","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:51.465Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-16T16:59:01.634Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2024"}
