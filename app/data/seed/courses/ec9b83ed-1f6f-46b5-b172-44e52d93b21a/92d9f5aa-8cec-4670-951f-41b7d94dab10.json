It prepares you to teach in primary schools. You are supported and challenged to evaluate your experience against the government’s initial teacher training requirements and participate in activities throughout the year to develop new skills and knowledge.\r\n\r\nYou will spend at least two thirds of your time on the course working in schools, returning to the University for a number of days across the year.\r\n\r\nPrior to the course, you will undertake pre-course activities and reading. We expect you to keep up to date with educational debates and current issues in the media. It is also a very important time for you to develop your knowledge of the subjects in the primary curriculum. \r\n\r\nCourse structure\r\n\r\nUniversity-based days\r\n\r\nAt University you are part of a vibrant cohort of beginning primary teachers. You will explore principles which underlie the teaching of the primary curriculum, varied and detailed approaches to teaching the curriculum and wider issues of becoming a teacher such as safeguarding and special educational needs.\r\n\r\nAssessment\r\n\r\nThe PGCE course is at a postgraduate Masters level. It offers you the opportunity to gain up to 60 credits at Masters level that can contribute towards a Masters level course. Assignments relate to two modules -  'Learning and Teaching in Schools' and ‘Issues in Primary Teaching.  One of the assignments is a school-based inquiry project.\r\n\r\nPractical teaching is assessed by the University tutors, school-based mentors and coordinators, and External Examiners.  Account is taken of your work over the course in a holistic way.\r\n\r\nYou are required to submit various pieces of work related to your course. These include written reflections, presentations and collaborative work.\r\n\r\nAll our Initial Teacher Training courses are highly rated locally and many of our students go on to work in partner schools each year. Ofsted judged our PGCE courses to be 'outstanding' in the last inspection.\r\n\r\nSome of the key strengths are: \r\n\r\n* University leaders who have an excellent track record of improving this already high-quality provision and demonstrate an outstanding capacity to develop and improve the quality of training and trainees' outcomes even further. \r\n \r\n* Their very strong integration of theory and practice, informed by the most up-to-date and relevant research, enabling trainees to gain an in-depth understanding of the latest developments in education and in their subject areas.\r\n \r\n* The shared vision and ethos, which permeates the partnership.\r\n","interviewProcess":"We look very closely at your application form. In particular, we are interested in your personal statement, your qualifications and your experience.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of our consideration of your application form, and the academic references that accompany it, we will decide whether to invite you for an interview.\r\n\r\nWhen you come for a PGCE interview, there are likely to be other applicants being interviewed alongside you. You will not be in competition with the other applicants – in fact, we are keen to see that you can work collaboratively with others. \r\n\r\nYou will be interviewed by PGCE tutors from the School of Education.  As part of the interview, you will be asked to carry out certain tasks that allow you to demonstrate your knowledge and skills, individually or in groups.
