Your training year will be underpinned with regular theory sessions and pedagogy either delivered in block sessions at the University of Chichester or at our alliance. Typically you will be based in school four days a week and attend training on day five.\r\n\r\nWe believe it is important that trainees feel part of the school environment from Day 1 so we host our interviews in school. This is an opportunity to meet the staff and feel part of their community before you officially start in September.\r\n\r\nTo ensure you have the best start in school we deliver pre-course training on 12 and 13 July and 31 August and 1 and 2 September 2022 before starting in school on 5 September. These training days are delivered in our dedicated training centre where you will meet fellow trainees, gain an understanding of the programme and receive the underpinning training that best prepares you for your first few days in school e.g. behaviour management, lesson observations, Teacher's Standards etc. Our trainees say they really value these sessions.\r\n\r\nEvery trainee is allocated a mentor who is a highly-experienced teacher and will offer personalised support and guidance throughout the year. Weekly mentor meetings will focus on setting short and long-term targets as well as reviewing your progress against the Teachers' Standards. You will feel like a valued member of staff as you will attend staff meetings and school training sessions. Assessment takes place in a variety of forms e.g. weekly formal lesson observations, weekly review meetings, academic assignments and gathering evidence towards the Teachers Standards.\r\n\r\nYou will be assigned a host school for the autumn and summer term and in the spring term you will spend a minimum 6 weeks in another school to teach in another Key Stage. All school placements are discussed with you and organised by the Teaching School Alliance.\r\n\r\nOn successful completion you will achieve a PGCE with the option of 60 Masters Credits) and QTS. We are so proud that we have a strong track record and 100% of our School Direct trainees pass and subsequently find employment in schools.\r\n\r\nIf you want to train with an Ofsted 'Outstanding' provider and be part of our success, then join us on your journey to teaching.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Your application is important to us and we will carefully consider you for interview.
