Typically you will be based in school four days a week and attend training on day five.\r\n\r\nWe believe it is important that trainees feel part of the school environment from Day 1 so we usually host our interviews in school.

These training days are delivered in our dedicated training centre where you will meet fellow trainees, gain an understanding of the programme and receive the underpinning training that best prepares you for your first few days in school e.g. behaviour management, lesson observations, Teacher's Standards etc. Our trainees say they really value these sessions. \r\n\r\nEvery trainee is allocated a mentor who is a highly-experienced teacher and will offer personalised support and guidance throughout the year. Weekly mentor meetings will focus on setting short and long-term targets as well as reviewing your progress against the Teachers' Standards. You will feel like a valued member of staff as you will attend staff meetings and school training sessions. Assessment takes place in a variety of forms e.g. weekly formal lesson observations, weekly review meetings, academic assignments and gathering evidence towards the Teachers Standards.\r\n\r\nYou will be assigned a host school for the autumn and summer term and in the spring term you will spend a minimum 6 weeks in another school to teach in another Key Stage.
