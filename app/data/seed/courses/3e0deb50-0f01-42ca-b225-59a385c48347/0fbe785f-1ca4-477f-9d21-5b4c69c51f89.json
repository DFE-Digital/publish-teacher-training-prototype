We will build your knowledge and teaching ability so that you can become a confident and inspiring practitioner, with the ability to spark children's imaginations and learning.\r\n\r\nWe have been identified as one of the leading teacher training providers in England. We are one of only 25 universities to have had their initial teacher training allocations confirmed for the next three years, an acknowledgement by the Department for Education of their excellent provision.\r\n\r\nThis course will provide training in all primary stage National Curriculum subjects, with a particular focus on the core subjects of English, mathematics and science. You will explore established educational theories alongside new ideas, concepts and developments in the field of education. Rigorous academic study on campus will be complemented by a range of practical teaching experiences to really enhance your professional development.\r\n\r\nOn campus, you will be supported by expert tutors who will help to refine your subject knowledge and teaching practice. Working in schools, you will be supported by school-based mentors and experienced teachers as you put your learning into practice and really hone your teaching skills. \r\n\r\nSchool Direct: For the vast majority of your course, you will be based in your alliance school or schools, learning on the job while being supported by experienced teachers and mentors. You will attend university at Headingley Campus for key seminars on subject knowledge and teaching for your chosen age range, with additional sessions for three masters modules. University sessions will take place in the autumn term and will reduce as a greater amount of your time is spent in school.","interviewProcess":"We are keen to identify candidates with clear potential to become excellent teachers of the future.\r\nMills Hill Primary School - Schools with Schools Teaching School Alliance operates a simple interview process. Candidates who meet our entry requirements will be invited to Mills Hill for a morning of activities.\r\nAs part of the selection process, candidates will:\r\n•\tdeliver a short teaching session to around 15 children. This will last around 20 minutes and will be based around a book or story. It will be observed by a member of school staff.\r\n•\tComplete a short maths test with a few number problems.\r\n•\tDo a spelling test containing key words that year 6 children are expected to know.\r\n•\tWrite a brief passage on a given topic.\r\n•\tExperience an interview with a couple of members of staff.\r\nCandidates are also asked to bring with them a small item/artefact to demonstrate why they want to become a teacher.\r\nDecisions are based on the whole process and difficulties with one of the activities will not automatically result in an unacceptable outcome.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will complete placements in two of our partner schools, which are all within 15 minutes drive of each other. Each school has an experienced mentor and your development will be overseen by the assistant head of Mills Hill. \r\nOur main partner schools are:\r\n•\tYew Tree\r\n•\tMather Street\r\n•\tBurnley Brow\r\n•\tSt Hilda’s\r\nThere are 3 placements in total in two contrasting schools. The main placement school experience is in the Autumn term and later in the year in the Summer term while the second placement school experience occurs in a contrasting school in the Spring term.\r\nAdditionally, we provide additional experience in Kingfisher Special School and a nearby secondary school. \r\nThe percentage of time spent teaching gradually increases throughout the year. Initially, this may take the form of small group teaching moving to ultimately being responsible for a class of learners.\r\nExact timings vary from year to year but on average, you will spend Thursday and Fridays until October half term at Leeds Beckett, Fridays until Christmas in Leeds and pretty much the rest of the time in one of your allocated schools. Previous cohorts have made arrangements to car-share or travel together for the sessions based in Leeds.\r\nThis time spent in schools fully prepares you for the start of your career in September ’20. You will be immersed in the daily life of a school and expected to participate in routine school events such as staff meetings and inset sessions.\r\n","personalQualities":" We firmly believe in delivering the best possible outcomes for our children and we are privileged to work with the next generation of teachers in order to shape both the learning and teaching of the future.  \r\n\r\nYou will have a commitment to our children and  have had some experience of working with children in schools or similar settings. A positive attitude to lifelong learning and the academic ability to sustain their study are both essential. Teaching requires commitment, hard work and dedication but, as a reward for these efforts, brings great personal satisfaction in a job well done.","otherRequirements":"We usually require evidence of experience working with children of different ages within the 5-11 age-range. Preferably this would be across KS1 and KS2 in a UK Primary School / setting and would equate to about 10-15 days in total. In addition, we value experience of working with children in contexts other than school and will take these into consideration.\r\nWe recognise and will take into account the difficulties of the last 18 months in arranging this.\r\n \r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:51:46.410Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-16T14:39:00.289Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2023"}
