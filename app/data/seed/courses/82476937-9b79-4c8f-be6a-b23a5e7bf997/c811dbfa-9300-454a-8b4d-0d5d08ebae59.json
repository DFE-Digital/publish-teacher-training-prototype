Trainees can choose whether to specialise in Early Years and Key Stage one (ages 3-7) or Key Stages one and two (ages 5-11). \r\nYour academic studies provide an opportunity for you to explore topics in greater depth. \r\nRegular assignments of varying length are set throughout the course and full tutorial support is given. \r\nYou will be assessed against Masters level criteria leading to Qualified Teacher Status and 60 credits at Master's Level. \r\nOur PGCE is validated by the University of Northumbria at Newcastle. \r\n\r\nOur centre-based training sessions are delivered by experienced teachers, advisors and lecturers. Throughout the course, theory and practice are closely linked. \r\n\r\nTrainees spend approximately 120 days in schools, putting the theory they have learned in centre-based training into practice. \r\nTrainees will experience at least two different schools, and are carefully matched with their placement schools to ensure their individual needs are met. \r\n\r\nTrainees must demonstrate competence against all of the QTS standards. \r\nA detailed file of evidence is submitted for final assessment which demonstrates how trainees have met the standards for QTS. \r\nEvidence is gained as work is carried out in the classroom or around the setting.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that the start date for this course is the first week of September and falls during the final week of the 6 week school summer holidays.
