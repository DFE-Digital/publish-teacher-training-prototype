Our course offers in-depth professional development experiences and is delivered by expert teachers drawn from our partnership schools.  Each school will also develop a more bespoke Professional Development Programme to match the needs of the individual trainees placed at that school. \r\n\r\nYou will attend regular taught sessions at LJMU which focus predominantly on developing your subject knowledge and subject pedagogy. Sessions are led by subject experts and are designed to equip students with the knowledge, understanding and skills needed to become confident teachers. In addition, university led lectures and seminars develop student teachers’ confidence in a range of relevant issues; classroom and behaviour management; meeting individual needs and inclusion; planning and assessment etc. There is a strong emphasis on social justice issues in education and on mental health and well-being. Sessions are largely workshop-based and participatory so that theoretical, research-informed teaching is explicitly linked to its practical implications for the classroom. You will be trained in a highly supportive and aspirational environment and will develop the rigour, professional knowledge, understanding and skills necessary for the delivery of creative, purposeful and challenging teaching and learning. \r\n\r\nThe Postgraduate Certificate is assessed through 2 Modules. The course team and our partnership schools have worked together to ensure that the PGCE Award is both relevant and manageable. The Award of QTS is integral to one of the academic modules. Trainees also submit one academic essay in two parts which focuses on reflecting on aspects of your practice.","interviewProcess":"Applications are screened initially by the Admissions and Information Officer at LJMU. \r\n\r\nInterviews take place in one of our partner schools and take about half a day. \r\nYour interview will include: \r\n•\tA formal  interview\r\n•\t25-30 min lesson to about 12 x KS3 students (Details will be forwarded prior to interview)\r\n•\tTour of the school\r\n•\tWritten task-This is an opportunity for you to further demonstrate your enthusiasm for your subject.\r\n\r\nPlease note - Due to the current global pandemic surrounding Covid-19,  Interview processes are subject to change and may be conducted by telephone or online.
