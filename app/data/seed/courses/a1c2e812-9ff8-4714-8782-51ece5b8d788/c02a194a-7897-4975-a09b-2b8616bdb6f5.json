Thursdays are training days where Trainees will join the other SCITT Trainees at Leventhorpe and occasionally one of our Partner Schools.\r\n\r\nDuring the training year Trainees will complete two assignments. The first focuses on the skills of medium term planning. It requires Trainees to focus on the needs of their pupils and the way sequences of lessons need to be planned and evaluated for pupils to make the best possible progress. The second assignment focuses on the skills of action research and requires Trainees to think about the needs of different groups of pupils within the classroom and how they might respond in different ways to learning activities.\r\n\r\nAssessment of Trainees against the QTS Teachers' Standards will be overseen by the Training Manager, who will be supported by quality assurance through the External Moderator. \r\n\r\nJudgement and moderation will take place in late June of the training year. The External Moderator will attend Leventhorpe and visit some Trainees in their placement schools to observe the teaching of the standardisation sample of Trainees.\r\n\r\nTrainees must meet the Teacher Standards at a minimum expectation. There will be a number of sources of evidence used to assess Trainees against the Teachers' Standards. These will be: Trainee Evidence Folder, lesson observation records and accompanying Professional Learning Conversations, the academic assignments and school placement assessments (completed each term by the Teacher Mentor and Professional Tutor), as well as the Subject Mentor and Professional Studies Assessments.\r\n\r\nIf you would like any further details or information, we would be very happy to hear from you.

For those subjects in the secondary age range 11-16, Trainees will teach across Key Stages 3 and 4, Year 7-11. For those subjects in the secondary age range 14-19, Trainees will teach across Key Stages 4 and 5, Years 10-13). In addition, trainees may be given the opportunity to teach outside of the age ranges for which they are being trained.\r\n","personalQualities":"We wish to recruit people from a diverse array of backgrounds and experiences, whether you are straight out of university or a career changer. \r\n\r\nA genuine enjoyment of working with young people and a keen interest in making a difference to their life chances is essential.
