The PGCE carries 60 credits at Masters Level which could later contribute towards a Master’s Degree in Education (180 credits). \r\nAlongside school based training, you will also undertake two 30-credit masters level modules, to gain a PGCE. These modules are taught by the University of Cumbria lecturers, who work closely with our school direct programme team, to ensure that theory and practice are closely entwined to really inform your teaching and give you a useful toolkit to take forward in your career.\r\n\r\nAs a summary, your PGCE course will include:\r\n\r\n* 2 separate placements\r\n* 12 Pedagogy for Learning (PfL) days when you will have the opportunity to specialise and enhance your subject knowledge and pedagogy in your own subject area.  These will take place mainly at the University of Cumbria Lancaster Campus and are spread over the year.\r\n* Additional training days are delivered throughout the course by experienced professionals, the majority of whom are outstanding practitioners in our alliance schools and colleges. \r\n* Two  modules connected to the PGCE  that are assessed by the submission of four written assignments, spread throughout the year, on teaching and learning in your subject and wider educational issues. \r\n\r\nTraining days, other than PfL days, will be delivered at either of the two main campuses in Preston or at alliance providers in the area.","interviewProcess":"On the interview day we want you to demonstrate strong subject knowledge, display a passion for your subject, develop a positive rapport with pupils and have the ability to inspire learners.\r\n\r\nThe key parts of the interview day are: \r\n\r\n* A twenty-minute mini -teach.
