Increasing numbers of students are choosing Geography because it is an exciting and relevant subject which plays a major role in helping children to develop a better understanding of the complex and dynamic world around them. Geography explores a wide range of contemporary world issues such as climate change, global geopolitics, migration and international development. There is something for everyone.  Geography is highly valued by universities and employers and provides students with a wide range of knowledge and transferable skills in preparation for university or life after school.\r\n\r\nPGCE Secondary Geography aims to:\r\n\r\n* Broaden and deepen your knowledge and understanding of Geography for teaching purposes\r\n\r\n* Provide you with an informed and critical view of National Curriculum, GCSE, A level and relevant vocational requirements\r\n\r\n* Raise awareness and provide experience of a broad range of learning and teaching strategies\r\n\r\n* Develop your skills in classroom management, planning, communication, assessment, recording and evaluation\r\n\r\n* Understand the differing needs of those with learning difficulties and very able students\r\n\r\n* Raise your awareness of a wide range of assessment strategies\r\n\r\nThe Geography subject specialism will run throughout the academic year and will cover a variety of areas including:\r\n\r\n* Planning and curriculum in Geography\r\n\r\n* Pedagogy\r\n\r\n* Approaches to student learning\r\n\r\n* Thinking skills\r\n\r\n* Enquiry based learning\r\n\r\n* Fieldwork\r\n\r\n* Creative approaches to learning\r\n\r\n* Fieldwork and outdoor learning\r\n\r\nGeography students will form part of a Humanities subject group along with History, RE and Social Science for generic sessions. There will also be a programme of Geography subject enhancement sessions. This approach recognises the need for flexibility and adaptability required of the Humanities based teacher.\r\n\r\nContinuous assessment is used throughout the course. There are no examinations.\r\n\r\nApplications are welcome from students with good/very good qualifications in their Geography qualifications at GCSE and AS/A level (or equivalent) and at honours degree level.\r\n\r\nApplications are also welcome from students with a Joint or Combined Honours degree in which Geography is one of the major subjects.\r\n\r\nStudents with related degrees such as Geology or Environmental Studies may also apply.\r\n\r\nA good A level Geography qualification would be viewed very positively.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Candidates who pass the screening stage of the recruitment process will be invited to attend an interview at the University of Leicester. If you are a school direct applicant you will also be invited to an interview at the lead school. The interview at the University of Leicester will typically last a full day and will include a tour of the School of Education. \r\n\r\nYou will be introduced to a written subject task that you will complete on the day. The interview is not a daunting process but rather a discussion about your suitability and preparation for going into teaching. During the interview, you will explore any additional preparation needed to help put you in the best possible position to engage successfully with the course from the start.\r\n\r\nWhere Subject Knowledge Enhancement (SKE) courses are available for the subject this will be discussed with you at interview. If it is considered essential for you to complete a SKE then it will be made a condition of any offer of a place.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will undertake two secondary teaching placements in our Partnership Schools. Leicester is ideally placed to offer the opportunity to work in both inner city and rural environments, with pupils from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds. We try to place students in contrasting schools to ensure you have a rich and varied experience in your initial training year and that you have the opportunity to teach across the 11-18 age range.\r\n\r\nThe placements are referred to as 'Phase A' and 'Phase B' placements.\r\n\r\nPhase A\r\n\r\nIn planning your placements, your subject tutor will try to balance the distance you are asked to travel with your individual needs and our knowledge of our wide range of school partners. \r\n\r\nAfter induction you will spend 8 weeks in your Phase A placement school.  You will build on existing experience and develop new skills with support from the school's Coordinator for Initial Teacher Education and a subject mentor who will oversee your professional development during the placement and liaise closely with your university tutor who will also support you.  During this placement you will be expected to fulfil a 50% timetable.   \r\n\r\nPhase B\r\n\r\nDuring your second placement you will spend about 14 weeks in a different school, also supported by a mentor, ITE Coordinator and university tutor.  During this placement you will be expected to fulfil a 66% timetable.  \r\n\r\nAll students will also undertake a week in a primary school following their Phase A placement to support their understanding of the broader context of education and to support writing of one of the PGCE assignments.","personalQualities":"You should be able to demonstrate a genuine interest in and enthusiasm for Geography at interview. \r\n\r\nApplicants without Geography as a major subject would be expected to undertake essential background reading before the start of the course. \r\n\r\nThe PGCE is a challenging course, and we are looking for applicants with a wide range of skills, knowledge, experiences and an aptitude for teaching.  These skills include the ability to form relationships, good communication, commitment to learning and teaching and reflective qualities. \r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"Admission to the course is subject to a satisfactory medical report. The University will provide more information about this should you be offered a place.\r\n\r\nAll offers are subject to a satisfactory enhanced DBS disclosure. We will provide instructions regarding the DBS application process once you have accepted an offer of a place on the course.\r\n\r\n  \r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:35.931Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-21T08:06:57.473Z","cycle":"2023","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
