Please visit our [website to find out more]: (https://le.ac.uk/study/postgraduates/fees-funding/scholarships-discounts)","aboutCourse":"The PGCE Social Science course aims to prepare you to meet the Teaching Standards fully and to teach Advanced level Psychology and/or Sociology with confidence and authority.\r\n\r\nThe PGCE Social Science aims to:\r\n\r\n* Introduce you to the variety of strategies and techniques available to the teacher in the modern education system; \r\n\r\n* Model the above strategies and techniques in University sessions; \r\n \r\n* Provide a set of principles which will allow you to operate as effective practitioners in new and challenging situations; \r\n\r\n* Introduce you to wider issues which confront Social Science teachers; \r\n\r\n* Inform about current developments in education which impinge upon their role as Social Science teachers.\r\n\r\nAll training will be done as a Social Science or wider Humanities group.    In addition, all students are required to teach one or more Humanities, PSHE and/or vocational courses.\r\n\r\nThe Social Science subject specialism will cover a range of topics for example:\r\n\r\n* Psychology/Sociology curriculum \r\n\r\n* Controversial/Sensitive issues in Social Science \r\n\r\n* Research Methods including statistics in Social Science \r\n\r\n* Examination and Assessment Issues\r\n\r\nContinuous assessment is used throughout the course and there are no examinations.\r\n\r\nSelection for the Social Science course is based on the general qualities required by the University of Leicester course as a whole. However, there are three other issues that applicants need to note: \r\n\r\n* To support your readiness for the school workplace, the course aims to give you a wide range of teaching experience across the Social Sciences. This means that you may be expected to teach Sociology and Psychology, as well as other subjects with social science content (e.g. Health and Social Care, Criminology) as part of your school placement. \r\n\r\n* As the Social Sciences have a limited presence in the pre-16 curriculum, successful applicants will show that they have the knowledge to teach outside of the social science curriculum, usually in the form of some Humanities pre-14 or Vocational teaching pre-16. To support Social Science students with this they may, at times, form part of a Humanities subject group along with History, Geography and RE specialists for generic sessions. \r\n\r\n* Other options for pre-16 teaching may be acceptable. However, there are limitations on the range of subjects that might be reasonably provided for in the PGCE Social Science course. \r\n\r\n* As competition for places on the Social Science course is fierce, early application for a place on the Social Science course is advised. \r\n","interviewProcess":"Candidates who pass the screening stage of the recruitment process will be invited to attend an interview at the University of Leicester. If you are a school direct applicant you will also be invited to an interview at the lead school. The interview at the University of Leicester will typically last a full day and will include a tour of the School of Education. \r\n\r\nYou will be introduced to a written subject task that you will complete on the day. The interview is not a daunting process but rather a discussion about your suitability and preparation for going into teaching. During the interview, you will explore any additional preparation needed to help put you in the best possible position to engage successfully with the course from the start.\r\n\r\nWhere Subject Knowledge Enhancement (SKE) courses are available for the subject this will be discussed with you at interview. If it is considered essential for you to complete a SKE then it will be made a condition of any offer of a place.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will undertake two secondary teaching placements in our Partnership Schools. Leicester is ideally placed to offer the opportunity to work in both inner city and rural environments, with pupils from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds. We try to place students in contrasting schools to ensure you have a rich and varied experience in your initial training year and that you have the opportunity to teach across the 11-18 age range.\r\n\r\nThe placements are referred to as 'Phase A' and 'Phase B' placements.\r\n\r\nPhase A\r\n\r\nIn planning your placements, your subject tutor will try to balance the distance you are asked to travel with your individual needs and our knowledge of our wide range of school partners. \r\n\r\nAfter induction you will spend 8 weeks in your Phase A placement school.  You will build on existing experience and develop new skills with support from the school's Coordinator for Initial Teacher Education and a subject mentor who will oversee your professional development during the placement and liaise closely with your university tutor who will also support you.  During this placement you will be expected to fulfil a 50% timetable.   \r\n\r\nPhase B\r\n\r\nDuring your second placement you will spend about 14 weeks in a different school, also supported by a mentor, ITE Coordinator and university tutor.  During this placement you will be expected to fulfil a 66% timetable.  \r\n\r\nAll students will also undertake a week in a primary school following their Phase A placement to support their understanding of the broader context of education and to support writing of one of the PGCE assignments.","personalQualities":"The PGCE is a challenging course, and we are looking for applicants with a wide range of skills, knowledge, experiences and an aptitude for teaching.  These skills include the ability to form relationships, good communication, commitment to learning and teaching and reflective qualities. \r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"Admission to the course is subject to a satisfactory medical report. The University will provide more information about this should you be offered a place.\r\n\r\nAll offers are subject to a satisfactory enhanced DBS disclosure. We will provide instructions regarding the DBS application process once you have accepted an offer of a place on the course.\r\n\r\n\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:36.148Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-05T08:00:50.777Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
