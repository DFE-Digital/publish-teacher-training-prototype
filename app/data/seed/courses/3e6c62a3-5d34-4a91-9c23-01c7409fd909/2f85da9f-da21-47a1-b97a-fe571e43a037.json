The course will ensure that you can facilitate your own students' development as fully literate young adults who can understand, engage with and create a multiplicity of texts both within and beyond the classroom.\r\n\r\nYou will have taught sessions and in-school mentoring from some of the best practitioners in the field and learn how to become an effective practitioner yourself. The programme will cover all areas of the National Curriculum for English and also address preparation for public examinations across the 16 -19 age range and KS3 school-based assessments. \r\n\r\nThe course has a number of distinctive features. You will gain experience of writing poetry and composing a writing portfolio of a wide range of other texts in collaboration with others. You will take part in practical drama workshops and learn about teaching many aspects of Media and Film Studies. \r\n\r\nWe want you to:\r\n* reflect critically on the English/Media curriculum and be inspired by the dynamic nature of your subject;\r\n* learn from examples of best practice and become effective practitioners yourselves;\r\n* be well supported by both university and school tutors and support each other in the development of subject knowledge and classroom expertise;\r\n* set high expectations for yourselves and your students;\r\n* develop an understanding of your professional roles within a department and whole school team; and\r\n* view the PGCE course as the beginning of your CPD.\r\n \r\nApplications are welcome from students with good/very good qualifications in their English qualifications at GCSE and AS/A level (or equivalent) and at honours degree level. Those students with joint or combined honours degrees in which English is a major subject are also welcome to apply. \r\n\r\nStudents with degrees in a range of academic backgrounds including American Studies, Classical Studies, History and Law have also made successful applications previously.  In all cases applicants are required to have an A level English Language or Literature or Lang/Lit qualification (or equivalent) and should be able to demonstrate a genuine interest in and enthusiasm for English at interview. \r\n\r\nApplicants without English as a major subject would be expected to undertake essential background reading before the start of the course and may need to undertake a Subject Knowledge Enhancement course prior to starting.  ","interviewProcess":"Candidates who pass the screening stage of the recruitment process will be invited to attend an interview at the University of Leicester. If you are a school direct applicant you will also be invited to an interview at the lead school. The interview at the University of Leicester will typically last a full day and will include a tour of the School of Education. \r\n\r\nYou will be introduced to a written subject task that you will complete on the day. The interview is not a daunting process but rather a discussion about your suitability and preparation for going into teaching. During the interview, you will explore any additional preparation needed to help put you in the best possible position to engage successfully with the course from the start.\r\n\r\nWhere Subject Knowledge Enhancement (SKE) courses are available for the subject this will be discussed with you at interview. If it is considered essential for you to complete a SKE then it will be made a condition of any offer of a place.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will undertake two secondary teaching placements in our Partnership Schools. Leicester is ideally placed to offer the opportunity to work in both inner city and rural environments, with pupils from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds. We try to place students in contrasting schools to ensure you have a rich and varied experience in your initial training year and that you have the opportunity to teach across the 11-18 age range.\r\n\r\nThe placements are referred to as 'Phase A' and 'Phase B' placements.\r\n\r\nPhase A\r\n\r\nIn planning your placements, your subject tutor will try to balance the distance you are asked to travel with your individual needs and our knowledge of our wide range of school partners. \r\n\r\nAfter induction you will spend 8 weeks in your Phase A placement school.  You will build on existing experience and develop new skills with support from the school's Coordinator for Initial Teacher Education and a subject mentor who will oversee your professional development during the placement and liaise closely with your university tutor who will also support you.  During this placement you will be expected to fulfil a 50% timetable.   \r\n\r\nPhase B\r\n\r\nDuring your second placement you will spend about 14 weeks in a different school, also supported by a mentor, ITE Coordinator and university tutor.  During this placement you will be expected to fulfil a 66% timetable.  \r\n\r\nAll students will also undertake a week in a primary school following their Phase A placement to support their understanding of the broader context of education and to support writing of one of the PGCE assignments.","personalQualities":"We strongly encourage all prospective students to spend time observing, and possibly  assisting, learners and teachers in secondary English classrooms in order to familiarise themselves with current developments.  We welcome applicants who have creative writing, drama, performance and media production skills which they wish to develop further for use in the classroom.  \r\n\r\nThe PGCE is a challenging course, and we are looking for applicants with a wide range of skills, knowledge, experiences and an aptitude for teaching.  These skills include the ability to form relationships, good communication, commitment to learning and teaching and reflective qualities. \r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"Admission to the course is subject to a satisfactory medical report. The University will provide more information about this should you be offered a place.\r\n\r\nAll offers are subject to a satisfactory enhanced DBS disclosure. We will provide instructions regarding the DBS application process once you have accepted an offer of a place on the course.\r\n\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:36.185Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-05T07:40:39.959Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
