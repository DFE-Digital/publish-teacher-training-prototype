Collaboratively, trainees will benefit from the knowledge and expertise of a team of practising teachers who lead key sessions and support with school-based training as classroom expertise is developed.\r\n\r\nNo in-school assessments are set. Instead, trainees are assessed on their developing practice through observed lessons and structured feedback.

Training begins at the start of the calendar school year.

A Professional Mentor will quality assure the training provision and liaise directly with the university.\r\n\r\nOur schools offer the experience of teaching 11-16 years old with an additional option to gain experience of post- 16 within Trust schools.\r\n\r\nCandidates are allocated to one main school for their training year but will have the opportunity to train for one school half term (approximately 6 weeks) in a different school to broaden their experience. This process is managed in partnership with Trust schools and the university.\r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for candidates with a genuine passion for their subject. Requisite skills to teach include skills in communication, listening, collaboration, adaptability, empathy and patience.
