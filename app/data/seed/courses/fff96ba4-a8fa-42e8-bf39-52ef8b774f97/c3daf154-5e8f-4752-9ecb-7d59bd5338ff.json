Your students will explore key themes such as the struggle between the church and crown, and the impact that this had on the ruling classes but also on the lives of the ordinary people. \r\n\r\nYour classroom will be brimming with opportunities for students to frame their own historical questions, and through the use of the methods of historical enquiry, make supported judgements to answer them.\r\n\r\nOn completion of this programme, you will be awarded a PGCE with QTS and 60 Masters credits in Education from Teesside University.\r\n\r\nWe are delighted to form our new partnership with Teesside University to deliver secondary teacher education in the Tees Valley region from September 2022.
