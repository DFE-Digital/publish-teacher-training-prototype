You will deliver lessons that equip students with the skill of creativity so they can develop their ability to utilise skills and techniques to communicate visual ideas.\r\n \r\nAlongside your students, you will explore a wide range of mediums which may include drawing, painting, printing, photography, pottery or sculpture. Observational skills will also be developed, not only through drawing, but also as your students scrutinise the works of key artists, and draw inspiration from their work. \r\n\r\nYour classroom will be brimming with exciting opportunities where students can develop their resilience, confidence, self-expression and sense of achievement. \r\n\r\nOn completion of this programme, you will be awarded a PGCE with QTS and 60 Masters credits in Education from Sheffield Hallam University.\r\n\r\nYou'll be delighted to know that we have a strong partnership with Sheffield Hallam University, who are a national centre of education and are recognised for their excellence and innovation in teaching and learning.
