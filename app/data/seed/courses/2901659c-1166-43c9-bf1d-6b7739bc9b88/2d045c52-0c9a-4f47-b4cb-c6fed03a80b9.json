The trainee will be allocated a personal mentor and together they will plan what they consider to be the best way of enabling the trainee to meet all the QTS standards. The SCITT Director and Subject Board Tutors will support trainees and mentors in this goal as much as they can. Trainees and mentors will organise teaching and school-based input to ensure a balanced timetable; this will be done at the beginning of the training to ensure the trainee fulfils all the requirements in terms of coverage. Trainees are required to attend a course of central training, which complements the school-based training. The dates of central training will be built into the trainee’s calendar for the year. The Professional Development Record (PDR) is designed to help trainees to plan the training; it is completed every week, identifying foci of thinking and work for the coming days.","interviewProcess":"Once we receive an application your application will be acknowledged and reviewed by the BASCITT Management Committee.
