Former trainees identify this as a particular strength: ‘On the job training is the best way to find out what works in practice’. \r\n\r\nDevelopment of a trainee's subject knowledge is a key feature of our training programme and we create many opportunities for trainees to develop their subject knowledge, not only first hand from your school based mentors but also from our subject knowledge trainers who are all practising teachers and share their extensive knowledge and expertise about how to teach their subject to secondary school students.\r\n\r\nSecondary SCITT Salaried trainees receive core and subject knowledge training on one day per week (a Thursday) throughout the training period from September to June.\r\n\r\nOn this course you will achieve a Post Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) with 60 Masters' credits and Qualified Teacher Status.  In order to achieve QTS, you will be assessed against all parts of the Teachers' Standards as you accumulate the evidence across the ten month training programme.  Additionally, to gain your PGCE there are three Masters' level assignments to write during your training and they help to link theory to the practice of what you are teaching in the classroom.  Suffolk & Norfolk SCITT are a 'personalised relational, ethical' Initial Teacher Training provider of the Secondary Salaried PGCE programme.  All trainees on this course will obtain the following qualification, QTS, PGCE with 60 Masters' credits on successful completion of the course.","interviewProcess":"After your application is shortlisted by the SCITT and Lead School team, you will be invited to a formal interview by SCITT.
