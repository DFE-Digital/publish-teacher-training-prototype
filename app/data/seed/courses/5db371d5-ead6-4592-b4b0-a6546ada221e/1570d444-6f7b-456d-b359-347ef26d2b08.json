At post 16 level you may work within your own Science specialism. \r\n\r\nYour school based mentors work alongside University tutors to focus on individual development needs during your school based practice. In addition, all of our Science based students have the opportunity to participate in Science specific Continuous Professional Development programmes for example, the Royal Society of Chemistry and Physics Partners. The purpose of this training opportunity is to up skill all disciplines around aspects of last year's GCSE examinations which were least well answered by pupils.\r\n\r\nSchool placements will cover the 11-16 age range, along with a KS5 enhancement.\r\nEntry requirements:\r\n\r\n* An undergraduate Honours Degree 2:2 or above, incorporating at least 50% in Chemistry. A subject knowledge enhancement course prior to starting the PGCE may be required in order to ensure you can teach all Sciences.\r\n\r\n* GCSE Grade C/4 or above in English and Mathematics (These can be pending but are required before enrolment).\r\n\r\n* Mainstream secondary school experience is beneficial but not essential.\r\nOffers will be subject to a successful interview, as well as a Health Check Statement and an Enhanced Disclosure from the Disclosure and Barring Service (formerly the Criminal Records Bureau CRB).\r\n","interviewProcess":"As part of the process, you will be required to:\r\n\r\n* Complete and submit a written task prior to interview\r\n\r\n* Plan, prepare and deliver a short input to a small group of students on a pre-given topic.
