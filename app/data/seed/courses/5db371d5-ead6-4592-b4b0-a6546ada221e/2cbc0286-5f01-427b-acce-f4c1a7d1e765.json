There is currently great demand for Physics teachers in UK secondary schools. St John Bosco Teacher Development Partnership, in collaboration with Liverpool Hope University, offers the support you need as you embark on a rewarding teaching career. \r\nAcross your placements, you will work with teachers of Science from all disciplines to develop your subject knowledge and pedagogy across all three sciences for teaching in key stages 3 and 4. At post 16 level you may work within your own Science specialism. \r\nYour school based mentors work alongside University tutors to focus on individual development needs during your school based practice. In addition, all of our Science based students have the opportunity to participate in Science specific Continuous Professional Development programmes for example, the Royal Society of Chemistry and Physics Partners. The purpose of this training opportunity is to up skill all disciplines around aspects of last year's GCSE examinations which were least well answered by pupils.\r\nSchool placements will cover the 11-16 age range, along with a KS5 enhancement.\r\nEntry requirements:\r\n* An undergraduate Honours Degree 2:2 or above, incorporating at least 50% in Physics. A subject knowledge enhancement course prior to starting the PGCE may be  required in order to ensure you can teach all Sciences.\r\n* GCSE Grade C/4 or above in English and Mathematics (These can be pending but are required before enrolment).\r\n* Mainstream secondary school experience is beneficial but not essential.\r\nOffers will be subject to a successful interview, as well as a Health Check Statement and an Enhanced Disclosure from the Disclosure and Barring Service (formerly the Criminal Records Bureau CRB).\r\n","interviewProcess":"As part of the process, you will be required to:\r\n\r\n* Complete and submit a written task prior to interview\r\n* Plan, prepare and deliver a short input to a small group of students on a pre-given topic.

These sessions are delivered by our wide-ranging specialist practitioners who are experts in their field.\r\nAs part of the programme, trainees undertake a placement within our network of SEND schools as well as an enrichment week, experiencing other aspects of school life.\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"What are we looking for in a candidate?\r\n\r\nWe are looking to recruit talented candidates who have the qualities and attributes suited to a career in teaching coupled with the drive and ambition to make it happen.\r\n\r\nThe sorts of personal qualities we are looking for are:\r\n\r\n* A friendly and approachable nature\r\n* Good interpersonal skills\r\n* Organisation and time management\r\n* Resilience \r\n* A passion for your subject\r\n* A positive outlook\r\n* A creative and innovative approach\r\n* The ability to reflect on and improve practice\r\n* Potential leadership capabilities\r\n","otherRequirements":"When attending interview, candidates will be required to bring photo ID along with GCSE certificates (English & Mathematics) and degree certificate if already received.
