This will be a 9 week placement \r\n* Phase 4: Week in a special School.\r\n* Phase 5: Three day placement in a primary setting.\r\n* Phase 6: Classroom Practice 3 in your home school.\r\nIn each Phase of Classroom Practice you will spend 4 days in school from Monday - Thursday. Every Friday is a training day at the training centre based at the John Taylor High School. In the morning all trainees undertake general professional studies training or work with a colleague from the University of Derby on PGCE assignments. \r\n\r\nAs a PE trainee you will have the option of completing additional coaching qualifications instead of the PGCE component of our programme \r\nIn the afternoon you will work with our Subject Pedagogy Tutor for PE who will  ensure that you have the knowledge and competence to teach  a range of sports and practical skills, as well as preparing you to teach the classroom based topics as required in Physical Education at both Key Stage 4 and Post 16. Examples of topics included in the programme are: \r\n\r\n* Addressing needs that have been identified in your subject knowledge     audit.\r\n* Promoting healthy active lifestyles.\r\n* Enhancing student leadership in P.E.\r\n* Behaviour management in a variety of practical environments.\r\n* Assessing live practical skills against identified criteria \r\n* Exam P.E across both KS4 and KS5 \r\n* Supporting literacy and numeracy in P.E.\r\n* Contributing to an extensive extra-curricular programme.\r\n\r\nSchool and subject based tasks support face to face training sessions and you will have the opportunity to share experiences with other during the reflect and review sessions on training days. \r\n\r\nThere will be 3 main assessment points throughout the year and by the end of the year you will need to demonstrate and evidence that you have fully met each of the eight Standards for Qualified Teacher Status as well as Part 2 of The Standards. A Subject Knowledge viva at the end of the programme will provide you with the opportunity to demonstrate how you have developed your PE subject knowledge over the course of the year.   \r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"If your application meets the eligibility and programme requirements, you will be invited to attend an interview in the Training Centre at John Taylor High School where you will be interviewed by a panel consisting of representatives of the SCITT Team, a representative from a partner school  or a subject specialist. \r\nPrior to interview we will ask you to complete a subject knowledge audit and undertake a small amount of research in preparation for the interview. On the interview day we will ask you to:\r\n* deliver a five minute presentation \r\n* plan a short  teaching activity for a small group of KS3 pupils. In this activity we are only looking to assess your ability to breakdown a concept to enable children to learn, your presence and professionalism and your ability to interact with pupils.\r\n* undergo a personal interview in which we will explore your reasons for wanting to become a teacher, your understanding of what it means to be a teacher and what constitutes outstanding teaching and learning.\r\n* Complete an English and Maths test.\r\n\r\nThere will a be an information session prior to the formal interview when we go through the programme with you in detail and provide an informal opportunity for you to ask any questions that you may have about our programme. ","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The John Taylor SCITT works in collaboration with 15 secondary, 35 primary and 3 special schools across our local area. Schools are usually within 30 minutes travelling time from John Taylor High School . When assigning you to a school we will give consideration to a schoolâ€™s competence and capacity, we will also plan for two contrasting placements and look at where you live. When applying for a location, we consider this a preference and cannot guarantee that you will be placed at your requested school.\r\nOurs is an 11-16 programme with post 16 enhancement and so you will teach across KS3 and 4 and, according to your aspirations and confidence, acquire Post 16 experience also. We encourage all our partners to provide a KS5 teaching experience for you, as we believe that this enhances employability which is extremely important to us. \r\nYour Home School, where you start and end your training, will oversee the whole of your training year and communication between your home and second placement mentor is  important to us to ensure a smooth transition between the phases. Both mentors will be involved in your end of phase 1 and 2 assessments and transition information shared. \r\nPrior to returning to your home school for your final phase, you will spend 3 days in a primary setting in order to develop your understanding of what pupils have learnt and what they can do when they arrive at their secondary school to continue their educational journey. You will look at how your subject is taught in the primary school in order that you are aware of their existing skills and can plan to build on them effectively. \r\nAfter completing you second placement in the spring term you will spend a week in a special school to deepen your understanding of the barriers to learning that some pupils experience and different strategies deployed by special schools to help pupils overcome them. We work with a number of different types of special schools and a Pupil Referral Unit who all support us with this component of our training. ","personalQualities":"To be successful on our programme, you need to have excellent subject knowledge and  be highly motivated, with a real passion for teaching  and  your subject.
