","aboutCourse":"Please note that this EYFS/Primary and not a traditional primary course. \r\n\r\nThe Marches is a School Direct  lead school in partnership with Chester University. The school  has a bespoke training centre for teacher trainees.\r\n\r\nIt features a study room with access to laptops, a common room with kitchen and bathroom facilities, printing facility, central work areas,  two other conference areas and car parking. In addition, trainees can study in the main school alongside the secondary teaching staff and have access to the school restaurant which features the most up to date cashless system and healthy menu options.\r\n\r\nThe school offers administrative staff who work solely with the trainees providing stationery, printing, induction training and support.\r\n\r\nThe course consists of three placements spread over the year, nursery, reception and KS1, with 130 days school based.  There are 5 weeks of study here at The Marches, three at the beginning of the course and one in the middle of the autumn term and one in the middle of the spring term. \r\n\r\nThere are 15 days of study with the University of Chester which are currently on line and spread over the course. In addition there are 10 single study days at the The Marches for core and 15 days at Mount Pleasant Primary School for foundation subject delivery and professional development.  The course is designed to maximise school based time as this is how we think that students learn best.  The Alliance currently have plans to develop another delivery hub,  from Powys. \r\n\r\nThere are three modules with assignments that are spread over the year. These carry 60 masters credits at level  7.  We offer support with the academic study as we recognise that this is in addition to learning to teach. The modules are very well written to link with the teaching part of the course. \r\n\r\nStudents have timetabled confidential sessions with our well being tutor in order to manage the demands of the programme.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of the student's teaching is bespoke as we recognise that some individuals have more experience than others.  A student will build up to 35% of a usual timetable by the end of the autumn term, 60% by  the end of placement 1 and 80% by the end of the course. \r\n\r\nWe offer enrichment activity  to improve student's CVs and prepare them for a teaching role. There is also time to resubmit assignments if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"\r\nApplications will be sifted by the lead school and the University.

We have a large partnership which spreads across Shropshire, Powys, North Wales and Telford and includes independent school as as well state schools. \r\n\r\nThe course is rigorous and we therefore try to accommodate the wishes of students as far as travel is concerned, we endeavour to place students within 30 mins of their home so that home life is manageable for the duration of the course. \r\n\r\nWe partner with many primary schools which include:\r\n\r\nNorth Shropshire\r\n\r\n* The Meadows\r\n* Holy Trinity\r\n* The Catholic School\r\n* Woodside\r\n* Morda\r\n* Whittington\r\n* Bryn Offa\r\n* Belan House\r\n* Ellesmere\r\n* Criftins\r\n* Lower Heath\r\n* Tilstock\r\n* Longlands\r\n* St Martins\r\n* Gobowen\r\n\r\nShrewsbury\r\n\r\n* The Grange\r\n* Oakmeadow\r\n* Meole\r\n* Severn Bridge Trust\r\n\r\nPowys\r\n* Llanfechain\r\n* Llandysilio\r\n* Llanfyllin\r\n* Guilsfied\r\n* Montgomery\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have a visiting tutor who will visit students in school early on in each placement to ensure that the mentoring structure is in place and all the paperwork has been provided.
