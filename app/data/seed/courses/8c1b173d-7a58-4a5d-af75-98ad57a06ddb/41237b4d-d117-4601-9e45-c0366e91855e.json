","aboutCourse":"As a school-led route the great majority of your time will be spent in your training school, and the content and focus of many aspects of the training programme will be targeted to meet your individual needs.  We utilise the resources of the school and our alliance partners to achieve this aim. Whether you are attending University or additional professional sessions within your host school, you will be working towards meeting the national Teaching Standards. Within the school setting, as your confidence and knowledge develops, you will be mentored and guided to work towards managing a trainees teaching timetable by the final term of your course.  You will then be prepared to teach a Newly Qualified Teachers timetable the following year.  We will fully support you and tailor the programme as much as possible to accommodate  your needs.  In addition, at Middlesex you will also benefit from access to the University's extensive resources, including those provided by the library and student support services.\r\n\r\nThe Middlesex School Direct programme provides you with a series of subject enhancement sessions, and a programme of professional studies which will be run at the University and at your host school. These may include sessions which:\r\n•Allow you to visit a variety of partnership schools and non-formal educational sites to enhance learning in specialist areas.\r\n•Provide you with opportunities to enhance your knowledge and pedagogy of your subject, or specialist area of the curriculum.\r\n•Develop your understanding of key contemporary issues within education, such as those around inclusion or EAL and SEND provision in schools.\r\n\r\nYou will critically evaluate the effectiveness of a wide range of resources and your own lesson plans. You will analyse research data and critically evaluate how research has contributed to the knowledge and understanding of how to teach effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to developing the knowledge and skills required to teach, you will also be able to identify and evaluate effective strategies for assessing children's learning through formative and summative assessment strategies. You will learn to critically evaluate the effectiveness of a wide range of resources for your subject and understand the importance of literacy, numeracy and ICT in delivering the curriculum.\r\n\r\nFor further information see https://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/science-with-biology\r\n","interviewProcess":"The Head of Department at the 'host' school will be interviewing you along with a member of the Senior Management Team.

You will be asked to prepare a lesson or part of a lesson in your subject to deliver to a group of students in order to assess your interaction and communication skills with young people. You will also be asked to sit a brief literacy and numeracy test.  \r\n\r\nThe tests provide a benchmark for the skills you will be required to demonstrate at the end of your course. You will also be asked to bring your certificates and photo identification with you on the day. \r\n\r\nOne interview will take place at the school and then a further interview may take place with the university. \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"When you are training with us you will train for the 1st and 3rd term within your 'host' school and then experience another school within the Alliance in the 2nd term.  \r\n\r\nOur lead mentor will visit you within your second setting to ensure you are supported throughout this time along with a mentor being provided every step of the way at the school. \r\n\r\nThis provides a chance to experience a different setting and perfect your practice whilst working towards the teaching standards.
