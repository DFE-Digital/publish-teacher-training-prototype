Within the school setting, as your confidence and knowledge develops, you will be mentored and guided to work towards managing a trainees teaching timetable by the final term of your course.  You will then be prepared to teach a Newly Qualified Teachers timetable the following year.  We will fully support you and tailor the programme as much as possible to accommodate  your needs.  In addition, at Middlesex you will also benefit from access to the University's extensive resources, including those provided by the library and student support services.\r\n\r\nThe School Direct programme provides you with a series of subject enhancement sessions, and a programme of professional studies which will be run at the University and at your host school. These may include sessions which:\r\n•Allow you to visit a variety of partnership schools and non-formal educational sites to enhance learning in specialist areas.\r\n•Provide you with opportunities to enhance your knowledge and pedagogy of your subject, or specialist area of the curriculum.\r\n•Develop your understanding of key contemporary issues within education, such as those around inclusion or EAL and SEND provision in schools.\r\n\r\nYou will critically evaluate the effectiveness of a wide range of resources and your own lesson plans.

You will also be asked to sit a brief literacy and numeracy test.  \r\n\r\nThe tests provide a benchmark for the skills you will be required to demonstrate at the end of your course.
