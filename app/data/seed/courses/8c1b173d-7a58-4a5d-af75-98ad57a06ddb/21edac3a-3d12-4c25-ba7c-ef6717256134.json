You will then be prepared to teach a Newly Qualified Teachers timetable the following year.  We will fully support you and tailor the programme as much as possible to accommodate  your needs.  In addition, at Middlesex you will also benefit from access to the University's extensive resources, including those provided by the library and student support services.\r\n\r\nThe School Direct programme provides you with a series of subject enhancement sessions, and a programme of professional studies which will be run at the University and at your host school.
