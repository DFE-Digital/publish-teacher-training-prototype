","aboutCourse":"\r\nAs a school-led route the great majority of your time will be spent in your training school, and the content and focus of many aspects of the training programme will be targeted to meet your individual needs.  We utilise the resources of the school and our alliance partners to achieve this aim. Whether you are attending your one day per week at University or additional professional sessions within your host school, you will be working towards meeting the national Teaching Standards. Within the school setting, as your confidence and knowledge develops, you will be mentored and guided to work towards managing a trainees teaching timetable by the final term of your course.  You will then be prepared to teach a Newly Qualified Teachers timetable the following year.  We will fully support you and tailor the programme as much as possible to accommodate  your needs.  In addition, at Hertfordshire University you will also benefit from access to the University's extensive resources, including those provided by the library and student support services.\r\n\r\nThe School Direct programme provides you with a series of subject enhancement sessions, and a programme of professional studies which will be run at the University and at your host school. These may include sessions which:\r\n•Allow you to visit a variety of partnership schools and non-formal educational sites to enhance learning in specialist areas.\r\n•Provide you with opportunities to enhance your knowledge and pedagogy of your subject, or specialist area of the curriculum.\r\n•Develop your understanding of key contemporary issues within education, such as those around inclusion or EAL and SEND provision in schools.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to developing the knowledge and skills required to teach, you will also be able to identify and evaluate effective strategies for assessing children's learning through formative and summative assessment strategies.
