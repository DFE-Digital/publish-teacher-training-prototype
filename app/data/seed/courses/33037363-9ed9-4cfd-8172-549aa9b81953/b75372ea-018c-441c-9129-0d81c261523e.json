The course is taught by an internationally-recognised science education group with over three decades of acclaimed research. The aim of our course is to make you an effective teacher of science and to help you develop high professional standards. The course is designed to prepare science teachers to work in secondary schools as part of a team that teaches science up to Year 11 and physics to Years 12 and 13 (post-16).\r\n\r\nThis is a full-time course that consists of four required modules and two blocks of teaching experience.  One will be based at Prendergast school and the other will be based in another secondary schools in Lewisham. You will complete the course within ten months, studying September to June. You must take modules totalling 120 credits to meet the requirements of the qualification.\r\n\r\nYou’ll engage in education, pedagogy and professional studies sessions and curriculum workshops. These will take place in both university and school settings and will develop your expertise in general educational and professional issues, as well as subject pedagogy. The course also prepares students to teach outside the classroom: there is a residential field-trip and several other opportunities to make best use of what London has to offer the science teacher.\r\n\r\nYou’ll gain the skills and understanding to take up positions in schools as a teacher of your subject with the potential to contribute fully to the life of the school.\r\nhe PGCE Physics at King's prepares trainees to become thoughtful, creative and engaging teachers, through understanding both the research which underpins and advances science teaching, and a wide range of practical approaches.
