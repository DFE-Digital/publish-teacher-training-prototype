You will also attend training at The University of Chichester (the current programme includes 25 days) and there may also be opportunities to visit partner schools outside of the Trust.  Your training time is divided between professional studies and subject study. You will study the relevant national frameworks for your age phase and subject area and develop your understanding of subject specific pedagogy. The programme is designed to equip you to promote the creation of a culture for learning through your role as a teacher, meeting the needs of all children. Furthermore, you develop your understanding of the place of the teacher in a whole school context and in relation to your further career development.\r\n\r\nAssessment is a shared responsibility.  University tutors and school mentors collaborate to ensure that your school based experience and written assignments are assessed at agreed points in the Programme.  \r\nSchool based experience is assessed against the Teachers’ Standards using information from a range of sources.\r\n\r\nYou will complete three assignments (one each term) the successful completion of which leads to a PGCE with 60 Masters Level credits. Preparation for these assignments is supported by university tutors.\r\n\r\nIn addition to resources within our academies all trainees have full access to the University of Chichester Learning Resource Centres including electronic access to a range of books and journals.\r\n\r\nWhere are we?\r\n(Please note that whilst all of our academies provide placements, all Primary applications are made to the 'main site' instead of individual schools.)\r\n\r\nTrust academies: \r\n[Arundel Court Primary School Portsmouth](http://arundelcourt.com/)\r\n[Berewood Primary School Waterlooville](http://www.berewoodprimary.co.uk/)\r\n[Bordon Junior School   Bordon](http://www.bordonjuniorschool.com/)\r\n[Court Lane Infant School     Cosham](http://www.courtlane-inf.portsmouth.sch.uk/)\r\n[Court Lane Junior School    Cosham](http://www.cljs.co.uk/)\r\n[Fernhurst Primary School    Fernhurst](http://www.fernhurst.w-sussex.sch.uk/)\r\nHighbury Primary School, Cosham www.highburyprimary.org/\r\n[Kingsham Primary School       Chichester](http://www.kingsham.w-sussex.sch.uk/)\r\n[Langstone Infant School Portsmouth](http://www.langstoneinfant.co.uk/)\r\n[Langstone Junior School    Portsmouth](http://www.langstone-junior.portsmouth.sch.uk/)\r\n[The Flying Bull Academy  Portsmouth](http://www.fbacademy.co.uk/)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe University of Chichester has two campuses.
