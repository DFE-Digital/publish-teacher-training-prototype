The programme leads to the award of a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE Masters level) with QTS and spreads across the entire academic year.\r\n\r\nYou will receive a regular training programme delivered within a Trust academy by practising teachers with proven, current knowledge and expertise in each subject. You will also attend training at The University of Chichester (the current programme includes 25 days) and there may also be opportunities to visit partner schools outside of the Trust.  Your training time is divided between professional studies and subject study. You will study the relevant national frameworks for your age phase and subject area and develop your understanding of subject specific pedagogy. The programme is designed to equip you to promote the creation of a culture for learning through your role as a teacher, meeting the needs of all children. Furthermore, you develop your understanding of the place of the teacher in a whole school context and in relation to your further career development.\r\n\r\nAssessment is a shared responsibility.  University tutors and school mentors collaborate to ensure that your school-based experience and written assignments are assessed at agreed points in the Programme.  School based experience is assessed against the Teachers’ Standards using information from a range of sources.\r\n\r\nYou will complete three assignments (one each term) the successful completion of which leads to a PGCE with 60 Masters Level credits. Preparation for these assignments is supported by university tutors.\r\nIn addition to resources within our academies all trainees have full access to the University of Chichester Learning Resource Centres including electronic access to a range of books and journals.\r\n\r\nWhere are we?\r\nAll secondary based training courses are based at Oakmoor School, Budds Lane, Bordon, Hampshire, GU35 0JB\r\nhttp://www.oakmoor.hants.sch.uk\r\n\r\nThe University of Chichester has two campuses.
