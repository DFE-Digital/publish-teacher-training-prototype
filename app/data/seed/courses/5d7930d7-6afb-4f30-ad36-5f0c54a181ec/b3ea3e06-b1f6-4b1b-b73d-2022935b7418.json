We work together with the University of Warwick, to offer the best possible teacher training experience.  Our strong partnership represents a mixture of large and small special schools. Through the training year we make full use of the strengths of our partnership and offer trainees access to a wide range of experiences and learning opportunities. \r\n\r\nThis is an exciting opportunity as we continue to develop our nurture provision to ensure our students have inclusive access to a broad and balanced curriculum, aimed at enhancing their literacy, numeracy and life skills, as well as their citizenship and understanding of the world around them, so maximising their employment opportunities as adults. \r\nOur nurture provision emulates a primary school model, including the curriculum; largely built around Cornerstones and incorporating students’ individual interests.  Creativity and differentiation are essential elements of our teachers’ planning.  \r\n\r\nSupport will be provided throughout the year from a range of trainee teacher coaches, with direct support and guidance from our nurture specialists and SENCo.  \r\n\r\nWhilst the course is a salaried placement, the successful applicant will be expected to pay their own tuition fees (£2k). \r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Interviews are completed by a panel of three people - this includes the Headteacher and Deputy Headteacher. \r\n\r\nYou will only be required to attend one interview.
