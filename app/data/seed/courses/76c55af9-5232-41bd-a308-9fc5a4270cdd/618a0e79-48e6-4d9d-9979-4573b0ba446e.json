The study of biology involves collecting and interpreting information about the natural world to identify patterns and relate possible cause and effect. Biology is used to help humans improve their own lives and to understand the world around them. For pupils to fulfil their potential, including many of the most able, they need to be taught by confident and highly competent expert who demonstrates passion and enthusiasm for the subject.\r\n\r\nIf you have a genuine passion for biology, going into a secondary classroom, to teach that subject, can be a wondrous experience. Passing on a love of biology is wonderful, and many teachers realise that they can never be bored teaching with so much variety in the job. Teaching itself is never boring - the kids are so entertaining; they will always surprise you.\r\n\r\nThe PL SCITT biology course will provide you with a wealth of practical teaching experience, and is carefully designed to ensure you are prepared for your first lessons in the classroom. Our enhanced opportunities to experience EYFS and primary settings will give you a grounding in the teaching of biology.\r\n\r\nWe offer subject pedagogy through the PTI new Subject Teacher days alongside delivery by our own Lead Subject Coach.  You will take part in subject pedagogy days and Specialist Leaders in Education (SLEs) lead these sessions, which don’t just allow you to gain knowledge of the best practical teaching approaches but also give you the opportunity to share ideas with other trainees in a wide range of schools. \r\n\r\nYou will be assessed both for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and through written assignments for Post Graduate Certification (PGCE).
