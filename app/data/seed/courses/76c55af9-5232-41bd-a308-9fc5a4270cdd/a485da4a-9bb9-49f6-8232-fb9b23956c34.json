Teaching should equip pupils with knowledge about diverse places, people, resources and natural and human environments, together with a deep understanding of the Earth’s key physical and human processes.\r\n\r\n As pupils progress, their growing knowledge about the world should help them to deepen their understanding of the interaction between physical and human processes, and of the formation and use of landscapes and environments. Geographical knowledge, understanding and skills provide the frameworks and approaches that explain how the Earth’s features at different scales are shaped, interconnected and change over time.\r\n\r\nThe PL SCITT geography course will provide you with a wealth of practical teaching experience. However, it is carefully designed to ensure you are prepared for your first lessons in the classroom.  We ensure you receive the necessary training in preparation and planning so that you are confident when you first stand in front of the class.  \r\n\r\nWe work in partnership with other SCITTs in the north west of England to provide the subject specific pedagogy that underpins your classroom practice. Specialist Practitioners in Education (SLEs) lead these sessions, which don’t just allow you to gain knowledge of the best practical teaching approaches but also give you the opportunity to share ideas with other trainees in a wide range of schools. \r\n\r\nYou will be assessed both for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and through written assignments for Post Graduate Certification (PGCE). They are separate awards however, and the whilst the QTS will be assessed by ourselves within the SCITT, the PGCE will be assessed by  your university tutors.\r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Our interview procedure is a rigorous process, including a panel interview, subject knowledge audit and mini teach. \r\n\r\nFurther details of the interview process will be given to those successful at the first stage of the application process.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The Training Programme is designed by experienced professional practitioners who share a passion for teaching and learning.

You will be trained in at least two of the partner schools in order to gain contrasting experiences of educational issues, such as discipline/behaviour management, for example.  \r\n","personalQualities":"At  PLSCITT we are also looking for the following qualities in our teachers:\r\n\r\nAn ability to relate to and engage with young people\r\nA clear commitment to a career in teaching\r\nEffective communication skills including use of written and spoken English\r\nStrong subject knowledge\r\nAn ability to explain concepts clearly\r\nA range of personal characteristics including flexibility, independence and resilience\r\nExcellent interpersonal skills with evidence of high levels of Emotional Literacy and Emotional Intelligence\r\nLeadership potential including evidence of Vision\r\nThe ability to work well effectively as part of a group\r\nInitiative\r\n","otherRequirements":" If a formal offer is accepted, applicants will be required to meet the Department for Education’s standards for physical and mental fitness to teach and clearance to work with children.
