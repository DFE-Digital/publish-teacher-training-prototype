There are many reasons to study chemistry, even if you aren't pursuing a career in science.\r\n\r\nChemistry is everywhere in the world around you! It's in the food you eat, clothes you wear, water you drink, medicines, air, cleaners... you name it. Chemistry sometimes is called the \"central science\" because it connects other sciences to each other, such as biology, physics, geology, and environmental science.\r\n\r\nThe PL SCITT chemistry course will provide you with a wealth of practical teaching experience. However, it is carefully designed to ensure you are prepared for your first lessons in the classroom and laboratory.  We ensure you receive the necessary training in laboratory safety, preparation and planning so that you are confident when you first stand in front of the class.  \r\n\r\nYour subject training includes the PTI new teacher training days. \r\nSpecialist Leaders in Education (SLEs) lead subject pedagogy sessions, which don’t just allow you to gain knowledge of the best practical teaching approaches but also give you the opportunity to share ideas with other trainees in a wide range of schools. \r\n\r\nYou will be assessed both for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and through written assignments for Post Graduate Certification (PGCE). They are separate awards however, and the whilst the QTS will be assessed by ourselves within the SCITT, the PGCE will be assessed by  your university tutors.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Our interview procedure is a rigorous process, including a panel interview, subject knowledge audit and mini teach. \r\n\r\nFurther details of the interview process will be given to those successful at the first stage of the application process.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The Training Programme is designed by experienced professional practitioners who share a passion for teaching and learning.
