Teaching physical education inspires all pupils to succeed and excel in competitive sport and other physically demanding activities, whilst providing opportunities for pupils to become physically confident in a way which supports their health and fitness. It builds character and helps to embed values such as fairness and respect through competition in sport and other activities. In short, establishing a sense of wonder and fascination with Physical Education is at the heart of an outstanding Physical Education teacher’s role.\r\n\r\nThe PL SCITT physical education course will provide you with a wealth of practical teaching experience. However, it is carefully designed to ensure you are prepared for your first lessons in the classroom and on the pitch.  We ensure you receive the necessary training in health and safety, preparation and planning so that you are confident when you first stand in front of the class.  \r\n\r\nWe work in partnership with other SCITTs in the north west of England to provide the subject specific pedagogy that underpins your classroom practice. Specialist Practitioners in Education (SLEs) lead these sessions, which don’t just allow you to gain knowledge of the best practical teaching approaches but also give you the opportunity to share ideas with other trainees in a wide range of schools. \r\n\r\nYou will be assessed both for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and through written assignments for Post Graduate Certification (PGCE). They are separate awards however, and the whilst the QTS will be assessed by ourselves within the SCITT, the PGCE will be assessed by  your university tutors.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Our interview procedure is a rigorous process, including a panel interview, subject knowledge audit and mini teach. \r\n\r\nFurther details of the interview process will be given to those successful at the first stage of the application process.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The Training Programme is designed by experienced professional practitioners who share a passion for teaching and learning.
