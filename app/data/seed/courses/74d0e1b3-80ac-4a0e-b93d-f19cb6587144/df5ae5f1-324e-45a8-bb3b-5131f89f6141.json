If you wish to apply to be based at one of our other schools in Kirklees / Calderdale, please apply for course 2C5K.\r\n\r\nYou are training to teach 11-16 age range.\r\n\r\nYou will spend most of the year here with a second experience in a contrasting school (usually Christmas to February half term).  This enables you to deepen your experience and ensures that you have the opportunity to meet all the Teacher Standards.  When in school, you are expected to follow the timings, practices and culture of the school.  Having an extended practice in one main school means that you can develop your practice well and show that you have a positive impact on your pupils, in your own classes.\r\n\r\nWe always try to take into consideration the location of our trainees and their placement schools to assist in their daily commute and try to work around other personal situations\r\n\r\nWe work with many schools for 2nd placement, too many to list but visit our website to view the map of schools we have worked with over the last four years.\r\n","status":0,"createdAt":"2022-01-14T14:17:01.456Z","updatedAt":null}
