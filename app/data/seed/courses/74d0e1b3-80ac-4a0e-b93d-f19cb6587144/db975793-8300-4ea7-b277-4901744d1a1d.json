Our model enables you to experience a full year in school and fully appreciate the demands/rewards that brings.\r\n\r\nWorking alongside your mentor, you’ll identify your ongoing level of knowledge, skills and experience and from that draw up and work continuously on your training.  This will involve observing experienced teachers and training activities leading to delivering whole class.\r\n\r\nYour core training is extremely diverse from theoretical input to observing excellent practice.  We support our trainees throughout their training year, enabling them to be fully prepared for teaching during their training and beyond.\r\n\r\nWe are one of a few providers who are fully supported by their local authority learning partners specialising across different education areas.\r\n\r\nOur moderation report (2019) said…\r\n\r\n4.3 The SCITT is able to draw from a bank of considerable expertise and resources, developed and acquired over time… ‘tried and tested’ trainers…acknowledged practitioners in their field…range of ITE resources … ensures that the ITE curriculum is covered comprehensively over the course of the year … \r\n\r\n4.5 … the SCITT manager is forward-looking and committed to adopting best practice to ensure that all trainees receive a ‘good deal’ and are equipped with all of the essential tools they need to teach effectively and impact positively on pupil progress. \r\n\r\nBy the end of the training year you will be fully equipped to deliver your subject from Reception to Year 6.\r\n\r\nIn order to gain Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) you have to be judged competent against the Teacher Standards.  \r\n\r\nAssessment is;\r\n\r\n- Half-termly Tutor visit reports and observations \r\n- 3 termly reports based on the Teacher Standards\r\n- 2nd placement report\r\n- 2 Assignments and 2 tasks\r\n\r\nWe work hard to create a reduced workload approach to assessment, basing many of our judgements on professional dialogue - not paper trails.
