In the first school placement, there will be the opportunity to mix with trainees from other disciplines during supplementary training sessions and to consider the ways in which theory is translated into good practice by outstanding teachers.\r\n\r\nMathematics is a core subject within the secondary curriculum. It encompasses the study of number, algebra, ratio, proportion and rates of change, geometry and measures, probability and statistics. These are all important elements of the mathematics curriculum and at Leicester we strive to ensure you become an effective practitioner of mathematics education with the ability to excite and engage pupils.\r\n\r\nYou will learn from some of the best practitioners in the field and, with their support, learn how to become an effective practitioner. The programme will cover all areas of the National Curriculum for Mathematics, and will also address national testing, extra curricular learning opportunities and your own professional development.\r\n\r\nThere are tax-free bursaries available for eligible applicants. The Institute of Mathematics and its Applications is also offering Teacher Training Scholarships to Mathematics graduates. For more information, please visit the Get into Teaching website.\r\n\r\nPCGE Secondary Mathematics aims to:\r\n\r\n* Broaden and deepen your knowledge and understanding of mathematics for teaching purposes;\r\n* Develop your understanding and insight into the ways in which mathematics is learned and potential difficulties;\r\n* Provide an informed and critical view of National Curriculum requirements;\r\n* Provide up-to-date knowledge and experience of curriculum materials, developments in assessment and examinations, and the potential of technology;\r\n* Provide a broad range of teaching and learning methods to cater for a full range of pupils; and\r\n* Develop your skills in planning, communication, assessment, recording and evaluation\r\n\r\nThe mathematics subject specialism will cover a variety of areas including:\r\n\r\n* The mathematics curriculum;\r\n* Lesson planning;\r\n* Subject knowledge: approaches to teaching and learning, including common misconceptions;\r\n* Teaching mathematics using technology;\r\n* Assessment of and for learning;\r\n* Theories of learning and teaching;\r\n* Communicating mathematically;\r\n* Differentiating to enable all pupils to reach their potential;\r\n* Teaching approaches to support problem solving; and\r\n* Maths outside the classroom.\r\n\r\nContinuous assessment is used throughout the course and there are no examinations.\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"There is a two-stage interview process.  If invited for interview, you will first meet members of the Northamptonshire Teaching School Hub team and will have the opportunity to meet current or former trainees and to see our lead school at work.  The interview takes the form of a conversation which will explore your ideas about education and your subject; the object is to ensure that those who join the course will have the best possible chance of becoming good and outstanding teachers.\r\n\r\nIn the second interview, which is at the university, you will meet members of the course team who will give an overview of the course and answer any questions you may have.  You will participate in a group task with candidates from a range of subjects and give a brief presentation as part of a small group.  Subject tutors will introduce a written subject task that you will complete during the day and you will have an individual interview with a subject tutor. The interview is not a daunting process but rather a discussion about your suitability and preparation for going into teaching. \r\n\r\nDuring the interview, you will explore any additional preparation needed to help put you in the best possible position to engage successfully with the course from the start.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will undertake two secondary teaching placements in the Northamptonshire Teaching School Hub partner schools. The placements are referred to as 'Phase A' and 'Phase B' placements.\r\n\r\nPhase A\r\n\r\nAfter induction you will spend 8 weeks in your Phase A placement school.  This placement offers ample opportunity to observe and learn from outstanding teachers.  Trainees also have the opportunity to discuss their work and progress with each other and to enhance their understanding of ways to apply what they have learned through a practical school-based programme of professional studies. You will build on existing experience and develop new skills with support from the Coordinator for Initial Teacher Education and a subject mentor who will oversee your professional development. Both will liaise closely with your university tutor who will also support you. During this placement you will be expected to fulfil a 50% timetable.\r\n\r\nPhase B\r\n\r\nDuring your second placement you will spend about 14 weeks in a different school, also supported by a mentor, ITE Coordinator and university tutor.  We try to place trainees in contrasting schools to ensure you have a rich and varied experience in your initial training year and that you have the opportunity to teach across the 11-18 age range. During this placement you will be expected to fulfil a 66% timetable.\r\n\r\nPrimary placement\r\n\r\nAll trainees will also undertake a week in a primary school following their Phase A placement to support their understanding of the broader context of education and to support writing of one of the PGCE assignments.\r\n","personalQualities":"You must have a genuine interest and enthusiasm for Mathematics and for working with young people. The PGCE is a challenging course and  applicants need a wide range of skills, knowledge, experiences and an aptitude for teaching. These skills include the ability to form relationships, good communication, commitment to learning and teaching and reflective qualities.\r\n\r\nApplicants without Mathematics as a major subject are expected to undertake essential background reading before the course starts.\r\n\r\nWe expect all prospective trainees to have spent some days observing, possibly assisting, students and teachers in Mathematics classrooms to familiarise themselves with current developments.\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"Admission to the course is subject to a satisfactory medical report. The University will provide more information about this should you be offered a place.\r\n\r\nAll offers are subject to a satisfactory enhanced DBS disclosure. We will provide instructions regarding the DBS application process once you have accepted an offer of a place on the course.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:54:37.626Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-04T16:15:07.796Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2023"}
