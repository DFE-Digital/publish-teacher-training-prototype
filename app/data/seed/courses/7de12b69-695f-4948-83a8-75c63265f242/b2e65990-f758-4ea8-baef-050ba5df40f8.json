In the first school placement, there will be the opportunity to mix with trainees from other disciplines in supplementary training sessions and to consider the ways in which theory is translated into good practice by outstanding teachers.\r\n\r\nThe PGCE English course aims to prepare you to meet QTS Standards fully and to learn to teach the 11 - 18 English/Media curriculum with confidence, authority and enthusiasm. The course will ensure that, as a creative teacher, you can facilitate your own students' development as fully literate young adults who can understand, engage with and create a multiplicity of texts both within and beyond the classroom.\r\n\r\nYou will have taught sessions and in-school mentoring from some of the best practitioners in the field and learn how to become an effective practitioner yourself. The programme will cover all areas of the National Curriculum for English and also address preparation for public examinations across the 16 -18 age range and KS3 school-based assessments.\r\n\r\nThe course has a number of distinctive features. You will gain experience of writing poetry and composing a writing portfolio of a wide range of other texts in collaboration with others. You may take part in practical drama workshops and will learn about teaching aspects of Media and Film Studies.\r\n\r\nWe want you to:\r\n\r\n* reflect critically on the English/Media curriculum and be inspired by the dynamic nature of your subject;\r\n* learn from examples of best practice and become effective practitioners yourselves;\r\n* be well supported by both university and school tutors and support each other in the development of subject knowledge and classroom expertise;\r\n* set high expectations for yourselves and your students;\r\n* develop an understanding of your professional roles within a department and whole school team; and\r\n* view the PGCE course as the beginning of your CPD.\r\n","interviewProcess":"There is a two-stage interview process.  If invited for interview, you will first meet members of the Northants Teaching School Hub team and will have the opportunity to meet current or former trainees and to see our lead school at work.  The interview takes the form of a conversation which will explore your ideas about education and your subject; the object is to ensure that those who join the course will have the best possible chance of becoming good and outstanding teachers.\r\n\r\nIn the second interview, which is at the university, you will meet members of the course team who will give an overview of the course and answer any questions you may have.  You will participate in a group task with candidates from a range of subjects and give a brief presentation as part of a small group.  Subject tutors will introduce a written subject task that you will complete during the day and you will have an individual interview with a subject tutor. The interview is not a daunting process but rather a discussion about your suitability and preparation for going into teaching. During the interview, you will explore any additional preparation needed to help put you in the best possible position to engage successfully with the course from the start.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will undertake two secondary teaching placements in the Northamptonshire Teaching School Hub partner schools. The placements are referred to as 'Phase A' and 'Phase B' placements.\r\n\r\nPhase A\r\n\r\nAfter induction you will spend 8 weeks in your Phase A placement school.  This placement offers ample opportunity to observe and learn from outstanding teachers.  Trainees also have the opportunity to discuss their work and progress with each other and to enhance their understanding of ways to apply what they have learned through a practical school-based programme of professional studies. You will build on existing experience and develop new skills with support from the Coordinator for Initial Teacher Education and a subject mentor who will oversee your professional development. Both will liaise closely with your university tutor who will also support you. During this placement you will be expected to fulfil a 50% timetable.\r\n\r\nPhase B\r\n\r\nDuring your second placement you will spend about 14 weeks in a different school, also supported by a mentor, ITE Coordinator and university tutor.  We try to place trainees in contrasting schools to ensure you have a rich and varied experience in your initial training year and that you have the opportunity to teach across the 11-18 age range. During this placement you will be expected to fulfil a 66% timetable.\r\n\r\nPrimary placement\r\n\r\nAll trainees will also undertake a week in a primary school following their Phase A placement to support their understanding of the broader context of education and to support writing of one of the PGCE assignments.\r\n","personalQualities":"You must have a genuine interest and enthusiasm for English and for working with young people. The PGCE is a challenging course and  applicants need a wide range of skills, knowledge, experiences and an aptitude for teaching. These skills include the ability to form relationships, good communication, commitment to learning and teaching and reflective qualities.\r\n\r\nWe expect all prospective trainees to have spent some days observing, possibly assisting, students and teachers in English classrooms to familiarise themselves with current developments.\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"Admission to the course is subject to a satisfactory medical report. The University will provide more information about this should you be offered a place.\r\n\r\nAll offers are subject to a satisfactory enhanced DBS disclosure. We will provide instructions regarding the DBS application process once you have accepted an offer of a place on the course.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:54:37.592Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-04T16:10:47.581Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2023"}
