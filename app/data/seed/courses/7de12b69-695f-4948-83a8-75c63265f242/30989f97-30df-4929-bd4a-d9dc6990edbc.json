In the first school placement, there will be the opportunity to mix with trainees from other disciplines during supplementary training sessions and to consider the ways in which theory is translated into good practice by outstanding teachers.\r\n\r\nAt university, trainee teachers within the History, Geography, RE and Social Sciences subject specialisms are taught as a PGCE Humanities group. You will have specialist inputs on your chosen subject and also gain experience of issues in planning and teaching cross-curricular work within the Humanities. \r\n\r\nReligious Education is an exciting and relevant subject which plays a major role in helping children to contribute to a cohesive and compassionate society.\r\n\r\nThe PGCE programme is both challenging and rewarding and we hope that it will develop both your enthusiasm and confidence as a teacher and Religious Education specialist.\r\n\r\nPCGE Secondary Religious Education aims to:\r\n\r\n* Support students to extend and deepen their subject knowledge of Religious Education:\r\n* Expose students to a wide range of strategies for teaching and learning and assessment in Religious Education;\r\n* Support students in exploring the use of ICT in Religious Education teaching and learning, including Internet resources and services and Blackboard as integral parts of the course; and\r\n* Support students to individualise their learning on the course as competent and committed professionals.\r\n\r\nThe Religious Education subject specialism will cover a variety of areas including:\r\n\r\n* The meaning and purpose of Religious Education;\r\n* Teaching RE at KS3, GCSE and A Level;\r\n* The possibilities, opportunities and limitations in the implementation of the non-statutory National Curriculum Framework for Religious Education;\r\n* Assessment in Religious Education;\r\n* Learning about and learning from religion;\r\n* Teaching religion in a diverse community;\r\n* Social, moral, spiritual and cultural development;\r\n* Holocaust Education;\r\n* Emotive and controversial issues;\r\n* Curriculum Design; and\r\n* Personal, Social and Health Education.\r\n\r\nContinuous assessment is used throughout the course and there are no examinations.\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"There is a two-stage interview process.  If invited for interview, you will first meet members of the Northamptonshire Teaching School Hub team and will have the opportunity to meet current or former trainees and to see our lead school at work.  The interview takes the form of a conversation which will explore your ideas about education and your subject; the object is to ensure that those who join the course will have the best possible chance of becoming good and outstanding teachers.\r\n\r\nIn the second interview, which is at the university, you will meet members of the course team who will give an overview of the course and answer any questions you may have.  You will participate in a group task with candidates from a range of subjects and give a brief presentation as part of a small group.  Subject tutors will introduce a written subject task that you will complete during the day and you will have an individual interview with a subject tutor. The interview is not a daunting process but rather a discussion about your suitability and preparation for going into teaching. \r\n\r\nDuring the interview, you will explore any additional preparation needed to help put you in the best possible position to engage successfully with the course from the start.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will undertake two secondary teaching placements in the Northamptonshire Teaching School Hub partner schools. The placements are referred to as 'Phase A' and 'Phase B' placements.\r\n\r\nPhase A\r\n\r\nAfter induction you will spend 8 weeks in your Phase A placement school.  This placement offers ample opportunity to observe and learn from outstanding teachers.  Trainees also have the opportunity to discuss their work and progress with each other and to enhance their understanding of ways to apply what they have learned through a practical school-based programme of professional studies. You will build on existing experience and develop new skills with support from the Coordinator for Initial Teacher Education, and a subject mentor who will oversee your professional development. Both will liaise closely with your university tutor who will also support you. During this placement you will be expected to fulfil a 50% timetable.\r\n\r\nPhase B\r\n\r\nDuring your second placement you will spend about 14 weeks in a different school, also supported by a mentor, ITE Coordinator and university tutor.  We try to place trainees in contrasting schools to ensure you have a rich and varied experience in your initial training year and that you have the opportunity to teach across the 11-18 age range. During this placement you will be expected to fulfil a 66% timetable.\r\n\r\nPrimary placement\r\n\r\nAll trainees will also undertake a week in a primary school following their Phase A placement to support their understanding of the broader context of education and to support writing of one of the PGCE assignments.\r\n","personalQualities":"You must have a genuine interest and enthusiasm for Religious Education and for working with young people. The PGCE is a challenging course and  applicants need a wide range of skills, knowledge, experiences and an aptitude for teaching. These skills include the ability to form relationships, good communication, commitment to learning and teaching and reflective qualities.\r\nApplicants without RE as a major subject are expected to undertake essential background reading before the course starts.\r\nWe expect all prospective trainees to have spent some days observing, possibly assisting, students and teachers in RE/Humanities classrooms to familiarise themselves with current developments.\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"Admission to the course is subject to a satisfactory medical report. The University will provide more information about this should you be offered a place.\r\nAll offers are subject to a satisfactory enhanced DBS disclosure. We will provide instructions regarding the DBS application process once you have accepted an offer of a place on the course.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:54:37.827Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-04T16:22:06.188Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2024"}
