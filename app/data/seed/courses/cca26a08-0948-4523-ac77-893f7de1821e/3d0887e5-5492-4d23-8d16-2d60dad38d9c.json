All of our teaching sessions are delivered by school-based staff from our small and niche partnership.\r\n\r\nAs we are a small group of trainees, the programme becomes very personalised and bespoke as the year progresses. For example, we can alter and change our training sessions to meet your needs. \r\n\r\nTo date, 100% of our trainees have either been employed or entered into further education. \r\n\r\nThe teachers in our partnership are outstanding practitioners who share a desire to be at the forefront of curriculum innovation, making learning topical, purposeful and thought-provoking. \r\n\r\nWe look forward to working with you, offering high-quality training, mentoring and coaching that will develop you as a teacher.
