For example, we can alter and change our training sessions to meet your needs. \r\n\r\nTo date, 100% of our trainees have either been employed or entered into further education. \r\n\r\nThe teachers in our partnership are outstanding practitioners who share a desire to be at the forefront of curriculum innovation, making learning topical, purposeful and thought-provoking. \r\n\r\nWe look forward to working with you, offering high-quality training, mentoring and coaching that will develop you as a teacher.
