It is predicated on the requirements to provide challenging expectations of you as a Trainee Teacher to create a teaching and learning environment which will engage your interest and motivation. The broad aims of the main curriculum component of the programme are to:\r\n* develop your Subject Knowledge and teach you how to put that knowledge into practice (pedagogy);\r\n* enable you to become a highly motivated, outstanding, effective, creative and reflective practitioner;\r\n* prepare you for a career in teaching that will prove to be successful and rewarding;\r\n* develop in you a commitment to and enthusiasm for continuing professional and personal development;\r\n*provide you with sufficient information, experience and opportunity in order that you might achieve the National Teacher Standards to enable you to be recommended for QTS (Qualified Teacher Status).\r\n\r\nThe programme places you in to two secondary placements, preferably offering a different type of training environment but at The OAKS you will also gain other vital experiences such as:\r\n* A week's placement in a Primary school\r\n* Post-16 experience\r\n* Visiting a pupil referral unit (PRU)\r\n* Spend time in a Special school for SEND experience\r\n* Have a MAPP (multi agency placements) entitlement  e.g. welfare officers, etc.\r\n* EAL (English as an additional language) in multi-cultural partnership schools\r\n* A two day (one night) residential at the beginning of the course to learn about how trips out of school can be successful in enhancing pupil progress and confidence with peers and adults.\r\n\r\nTo supplement the University programme, each week you will also attend CPD sessions at Blackfriars Teaching School where you will be taught by highly experienced tutors on a wide range of topics. These weekly sessions are also an excellent opportunity to network and share experiences with other trainees .\r\n\r\nThe programme offers a very diverse and exciting spread of experiences which should enable you to gain very valuable experience to take to your first school as an NQT. We will keep in touch through this year and offer even more continuing support.  The OAKS team wants to support you and maintain a caring environment which we hope that you will eventually offer to your future pupils.\r\n\r\nFor further information regarding the specific programme content for individual subjects, please see The OAKS website (theoaks.org.uk)","interviewProcess":"There are two stages to our selection procedure that are both seen as fair and robust.\r\nStage 1\r\nThis initial stage is all completed at the OAKS.  We scrutinise very carefully all applicants UCAS applications.  Special attention must be taken on making sure that every applicant meets our entry requirements .  The personal statement is a very important section; so applicants must make sure that they are addressing the correct themes in this free written prose.  We are looking for certain characteristics which make it easy for us to select for interview and a certain standard of English.  References are always called for; this gives us other important information.\r\nStage2\r\nThis part of the selection process takes place in your selected school wherever possible or one of our other partnership schools. There will be a written task, trial QTS tests may be given (dependent upon whether you have already passed them or not) and a formal interview.  Perhaps the most important part of stage 2 is your interaction with a group of pupils (either in a classroom or group setting).  We always ask for their opinions on your involvement; their voice matters to us!\r\nThe decision as to whether you are invited on to our course will usually take place at the end of stage 2.  Any applicants who are rejected will receive a full written reason why they have been unsuccessful.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will undertake two secondary school placements during the programme. Whilst every effort will be made to ensure that you are placed in your chosen school, this cannot be guaranteed.\r\n\r\nAll of the schools in the Blackfriars Teaching School Alliance are incredibly experienced in welcoming and nurturing Trainee Teachers. From day one you will be made to feel part of the team and will be surrounded by passionate people who are dedicated to making a difference. As well as receiving excellent support from our mentors in school, all Trainee Teachers within the Blackfriars Teaching School partnership are offered a weekly CPDT Programme which supplements the University programme. These CPDT sessions offer Trainee Teachers the opportunity to learn from practitioners who are experts in their field and also allows time to share best practice and network.\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for energetic and skilled individuals who have a real passion and commitment to working with children and young people.\r\n We are looking for individuals who:       \r\n* Are good at explaining things to others;\r\n* Enjoy working with a wide range of people;\r\n* Are enthusiastic;\r\n* Have a strong knowledge in particular subject areas;\r\n* Are good time-managers;\r\n* Have the ability to work in a team as well as using your own initiative;\r\n* Keep cool under pressure;      \r\n* Have patience and a good sense of humour;       \r\n* Cope well with change;       \r\n* Enjoy a challenge.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:47:33.426Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-28T10:18:29.082Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2024"}
