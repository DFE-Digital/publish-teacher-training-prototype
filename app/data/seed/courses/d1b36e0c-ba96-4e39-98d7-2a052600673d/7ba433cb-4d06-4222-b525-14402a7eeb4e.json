","aboutCourse":"This course will enable you to use your degree level skills in the teaching of art and design so that the young people you work with can explore, understand and challenge the visual culture that surrounds them.\r\nWe believe that art and design is a crucial element in the education of all pupils, and will work with you to enable you to become the inspirational secondary school teacher that today’s young people deserve.\r\nOur course provides you with the knowledge and understanding that will enable your current creative skills to grow into exciting and engaging teaching for the classroom. \r\nThe course is a practice-based programme that will fully support you into becoming a confident, dynamic and creative teacher committed to making art and design accessible for all.\r\nCentral to the curriculum is the study of art and design pedagogy and professional practice, which you will access through a synthesis of creative practical workshops, lectures, seminar groups and individual study.\r\nCurriculum workshops are a key element of your course. Dedicated, full-time art and design lecturers and teachers deliver these in our fully equipped specialist art and design studios. The workshops enable you to experience a range of practical work in key specialisms such as digital media, contemporary art including installation, drawing, printmaking, ceramics, mixed media, and craft media. We also work with the Education Curators in leading regional galleries that have included IKON Gallery, New Art Gallery Walsall, BMAG and Eastside Projects.\r\n\r\nIf you are passionate about teaching, ambitious, reflective and with excellent communication skills and a desire to positively influence and transform young people’s lives, we look forward to receiving your application.\r\nIn return we will offer you: • a PGCE programme with QTS and Master’s level credits with our Higher Education Institution (HEI) partner, Birmingham City University • a training programme including sessions at university, Higham Lane School as well as your placement schools • an on-the-job training approach working alongside experienced teachers to plan, deliver and evaluate lessons from the start of the academic year • teaching experience at 2 complementary schools • opportunities to work alongside other trainees to share ideas and experiences • both subject and professional mentors to support and guide you through your training year.\r\n\r\nSuccessful applicants may be placed at any of our schools depending on phase and subject specialism.\r\n\r\nFor more information on our partner schools, please see (https://www.highamlaneschool.co.uk/partnership).\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"You will be invited to interview either, at your base school or the lead school. You will have a tour of the school and an opportunity to meet staff and students in your chosen department. You will be asked to prepare a 20 minute learning activity to deliver to a group of Year 7 or Year 8 students. There will also be a baseline assessment of subject knowledge, literacy and numeracy skills. Following this, you will have an interview with our School Direct Co-ordinator and a representative from your base school, either the professional or subject mentor. All of this gives us an opportunity to find out a bit more about you and it is also an opportunity for you to meet us and establish whether this is the right course for you! You will be contacted later the same day with our decision. Successful applicants will also be offered the opportunity of some school experience with our partnership prior to starting the course. This will enable you to talk to teachers and students, observe teaching and pastoral work and become familiar with policies and procedures. All of this will give you valuable insight and a great experience prior to starting your course. It will also mean you are a familiar face in school to both staff and students and you can really hit the ground running in September!\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Successful applicants may be placed at any of our schools depending on subject specialism.
