","aboutCourse":"We will help develop you into a teacher who enables pupils to use computational thinking and creativity to understand and change the world. You’ll encourage pupils in their ability to problem solve using a variety of powerful modelling techniques. Your impact will be far-reaching, ensuring your pupils become creators of technology and not just consumers. You will help them develop transferable skills that can be used in a range of subject areas.\r\nThis course benefits from strong links with the British Computer Society (BCS) who are working with the Department for Education to develop the next generation of computing teachers through an organisation called\r\nComputing at School. The opportunities this partnership provides allows you to network with expert computing teachers throughout the West Midlands at regular hub meetings and access subject development opportunities.\r\nYou’ll explore, test and develop the links between computing in education theory and its practice. The practical workshops in University facilitate a means for learners to conduct this, which is then supported by school placements.\r\nThis relationship, between theory and practice, alongside a variety of contrasting school experiences, ensures that you are offered a well-rounded teacher education. We believe that we are training computing teachers to work in any school setting. Your course will feature a range of modules and the opportunity to get plenty of hands-on practice in local schools with support from colleagues in the school partnership and experienced University tutors.\r\n\r\nIf you are passionate about teaching, ambitious, reflective and with excellent communication skills and a desire to positively influence and transform young people’s lives, we look forward to receiving your application.\r\nIn return we will offer you: • a PGCE programme with QTS and Master’s level credits with our Higher Education Institution (HEI) partner, Birmingham City University • a training programme including sessions at university, Higham Lane School as well as your placement schools • an on-the-job training approach working alongside experienced teachers to plan, deliver and evaluate lessons from the start of the academic year • teaching experience at 2 complementary schools • opportunities to work alongside other trainees to share ideas and experiences • both subject and professional mentors to support and guide you through your training year.\r\n\r\nSuccessful applicants may be placed at any of our schools depending on phase and subject specialism.\r\n\r\nFor more information on our partner schools, please see (https://www.highamlaneschool.co.uk/partnership).\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"You will be invited to interview either, at your base school or the lead school. You will have a tour of the school and an opportunity to meet staff and students in your chosen department. You will be asked to prepare a 20 minute learning activity to deliver to a group of Year 7 or Year 8 students. There will also be a baseline assessment of subject knowledge, literacy and numeracy skills. Following this, you will have an interview with our School Direct Co-ordinator and a representative from your base school, either the professional or subject mentor. All of this gives us an opportunity to find out a bit more about you and it is also an opportunity for you to meet us and establish whether this is the right course for you! You will be contacted later the same day with our decision. Successful applicants will also be offered the opportunity of some school experience with our partnership prior to starting the course. This will enable you to talk to teachers and students, observe teaching and pastoral work and become familiar with policies and procedures. All of this will give you valuable insight and a great experience prior to starting your course. It will also mean you are a familiar face in school to both staff and students and you can really hit the ground running in September!\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Successful applicants may be placed at any of our schools depending on subject specialism.
