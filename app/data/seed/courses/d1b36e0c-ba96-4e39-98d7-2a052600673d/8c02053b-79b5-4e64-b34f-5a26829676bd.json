","aboutCourse":"This is a great career which gives you have the chance to encourage young people to follow their dreams, explore, challenge and understand the world in which they live, and develop their appreciation of the dramatic form. The ability to tell a story powerfully through actions as well as words is important, and you’ll learn how to inspire and encourage your pupils to express themselves in this way. As a teacher you will offer your pupils a wide range of experiences using a variety of techniques in many different forms of drama, helping them to become more self-confident.\r\nThis course has strong links with local theatre companies such as the internationally-renowned Big Brum Theatre in Education Company. You will have the opportunity to collaborate with Big Brum to create enriching drama education.\r\nYou’ll explore, test and develop the links between drama in education theory and its practice. The practical workshops facilitate a space for you to conduct this, which is then supported by school placements.\r\nThis relationship, between theory and practice, alongside a variety of contrasting school experiences, ensures that you have a well-rounded teacher education. We believe that we are training drama teachers to work in any school setting. Your course will feature a range of modules and the opportunity to get plenty of hands-on practice in local schools with support from colleagues in the school partnership and experienced university tutors.\r\n\r\nIf you are passionate about teaching, ambitious, reflective and with excellent communication skills and a desire to positively influence and transform young people’s lives, we look forward to receiving your application.\r\nIn return we will offer you: • a PGCE programme with QTS and Master’s level credits with our Higher Education Institution (HEI) partner, Birmingham City University • a training programme including sessions at university, Higham Lane School as well as your placement schools • an on-the-job training approach working alongside experienced teachers to plan, deliver and evaluate lessons from the start of the academic year • teaching experience at 2 complementary schools • opportunities to work alongside other trainees to share ideas and experiences • both subject and professional mentors to support and guide you through your training year.\r\n\r\nSuccessful applicants may be placed at any of our schools depending on phase and subject specialism.\r\n\r\nFor more information on our partner schools, please see (https://www.highamlaneschool.co.uk/partnership).\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"You will be invited to interview either, at your base school or the lead school.
