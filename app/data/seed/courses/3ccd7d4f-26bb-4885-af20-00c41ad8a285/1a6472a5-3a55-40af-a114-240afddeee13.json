It reflects the exceptional standards in Redbridge schools and our understanding of what makes an excellent teacher. We are committed to offering high quality training for local candidates with the aim of securing the beginning of a successful career in a Redbridge school. We also aim to support trainees' careers after completing the programme through excellent CPD opportunities on offer from the Gants Hill Partnership Teaching Alliance. This includes subject knowledge and leadership training, and opportunities to take part in research and to work collaboratively with colleagues in other schools. There is also the opportunity to achieve a masters in your NQT year, taking forward an action research school direct module credit towards this qualification, through a successfully run school-led course in collaboration with UEL. \r\n\r\nThe three lead schools (Mayespark Primary, Gearies Primary and Churchfields Junior School) will scrutinize the School Direct applications and place trainees in the partnership schools. These are excellent mainstream schools that are committed to supporting the process of the training in Redbridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"We encourage candidates to visit our school prior to the selection process consisting of the following:\r\n -The scrutiny of a lesson plan to teach a specified aspect of the curriculum.\r\n- The observation by a head teacher of the applicant delivering a lesson to the agreed year group \r\n-A formal interview\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"This one-year primary course is based in one school for the majority of the year with a contrast setting placement.
