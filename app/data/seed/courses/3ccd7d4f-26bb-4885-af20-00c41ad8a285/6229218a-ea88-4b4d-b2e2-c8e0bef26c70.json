Candidates learn the art of teaching in the classroom for four days each week, guided by their mentors.  Each trainee is allocated a professional tutor who visits and supports the trainee on a regular basis. Host schools are able to offer insights into their successful practices and induct trainees in line with the best of current teaching.  Part of the course is theory based and there will be formal training each Thursday.  School Direct requires a full time commitment of 5 days per week from September to July and trainees are expected to participate fully in the everyday life of the schools in which they train.
