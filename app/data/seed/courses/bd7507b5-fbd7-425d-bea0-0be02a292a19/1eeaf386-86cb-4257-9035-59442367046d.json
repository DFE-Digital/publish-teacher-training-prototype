The selection process will be thorough and rigorous, in order to help us place trainees at suitable placement schools.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Placement schools are selected for candidates following a careful process of working with local headteachers to establish where our best subject specialist mentors are placed across the borough and what school recruitment needs are likely to be in the future. Most first placements (A) will be decided by late June and the second shorter placement (B) in early September once school staffing has been agreed.\r\n\r\nYou will have two placements (the A-B-A model).  Placement A runs from September to February half term and placement B from February until Easter.  Trainees will then return to their placement A school until June.   The settings are contrasting to ensure breadth of experience. \r\n\r\nThe Alliance has teaching opportunities in the full secondary range from 11-19.  If you have a placement in a school which is currently 11-16 you will be given the opportunity for KS5 experience at another school.  There are 10 schools in the Alliance and Schools Direct trainees will have one main placement and one second placement across the year.\r\n \r\nYou will spend 4 days a week in school and one day at University on a Wednesday. This day will give you essential time out from the school classroom to build your knowledge and experience and reflect on your placements. \r\n \r\nRichmond Borough is a small locality and all schools within the partnership have excellent local transport links. All teachers will be placed in the borough. \r\n \r\nAll trainees will be assigned to a tutor group and mentor throughout their placements. \r\n \r\n","personalQualities":"","otherRequirements":"","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:48:04.174Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-13T10:35:16.265Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2024"}
