Placement A runs from September to February half term and placement B from February until Easter.  Trainees will then return to their placement A school until June.

If you have a placement in a school which is currently 11-16 you will be given the opportunity for KS5 experience at another school.  There are 10 schools in the Alliance and Schools Direct trainees will have one main placement and one second placement across the year.\r\n \r\nYou will spend 4 days a week in school and one day at University on a Wednesday. This day will give you essential time out from the school classroom to build your knowledge and experience and reflect on your placements. \r\n \r\nRichmond Borough is a small locality and all schools within the partnership have excellent local transport links.
