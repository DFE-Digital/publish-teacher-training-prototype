Excellent, relevant training is provided by experienced practitioners and subject specialists and tailored to the individual needs of trainees. You will cover the subject knowledge required to teach across the primary age range (3-11years) including teaching English, Maths, Science and foundation subjects.

We have close relationships with high performing schools to aid your training.\r\n\r\nTrainees complete their first and final placement in a Jewish school and their second placement in a contrasting school. This takes place in a diverse, secular school and enables trainees to teach children from a variety of cultures and backgrounds. \r\nIn each school placement, trainees build up gradually their teaching and are supported by experienced mentors in school. They are also visited regularly by their own LSJS Professional Tutor who is responsible for monitoring their progress during school experiences.\r\n","personalQualities":"","otherRequirements":"","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:56.962Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-01T09:19:21.627Z","cycle":"2023","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"}
