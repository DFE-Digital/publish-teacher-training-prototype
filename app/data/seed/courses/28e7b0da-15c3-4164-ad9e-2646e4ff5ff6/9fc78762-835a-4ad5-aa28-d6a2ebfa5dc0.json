We will work closely with our university partners to co-ordinate this process. \r\n\r\nAs teaching is a pupil-centric profession, a key part of the interview process will be interaction with young people. This may be working with a small group or short teaching activity. You will be given clearer guidelines for this prior to interview though. Our young people are incredibly astute and you will also face a student panel, which is often worse than any job interview! You may be asked to complete a short literacy or numeracy test. However, you will be given details about this in advance. \r\nThere will also be a formal interview, in which our University partners will be involved. Whilst it can seem a daunting process, it is a thorough process that is designed to get the best match of applicant to the place available. \r\n\r\nThe interview process is designed to highlight a candidates areas of strength both pedagogically and in regards to their subject knowledge.  \r\n\r\nThe interview process typically includes:\r\n- A learning walk\r\n- The delivery of a short subject specific activity to a small group of students\r\n- Subject knowledge test\r\n- Student panel\r\n- Formal interview\r\n\r\nPlease note the interview process may vary from that detailed above due to COVID-19 restrictions.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We are looking for individuals- we know that no teacher fits a mould and we want you to bring your experience, enthusiasm and dedication. You should be ambitious and engaging, passionate about your subject, but most importantly, passionate about developing young people. \r\n\r\nYou should have some experience of working with young people.
