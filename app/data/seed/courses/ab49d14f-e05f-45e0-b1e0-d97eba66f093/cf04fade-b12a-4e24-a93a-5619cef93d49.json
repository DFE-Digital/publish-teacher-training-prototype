The day consists of four different tasks, a Written Communication Task, a Subject Specific Planning Task, a Pupil Teaching Activity and a formal interview. \r\nWe will inform you in advance about the age group you will be teaching, as well as any pre-interview guidance for the other activities as required.\r\n\r\nDuring the interview, you will have the opportunity to meet and talk to staff and children and ask questions.
