It is a very practical course with around two-thirds of the time spent in schools, mostly working with teachers and pupils, and around one third spent on directed study, with partnership training in the University and school.\r\n\r\nThis full-time course includes both school-based experience and sessions at the university with a strong focus on integrating theory and practice. At least 120 days will be based in schools. School placements are carefully structured to ensure the gradual development of your confidence as an effective teacher through building up experiences working with university-based mentors and school-based mentors. \r\n\r\nIt is an integrated academic and professional preparation for teaching, combining study at either postgraduate or professional level with practical training to meet the Teachers’ Standards. The goal is that you should become a reflective practitioner – a teacher who thinks about their experiences and learns from them in order to improve their practice.\r\n\r\nThe course will include lectures, seminars, workshops, independent study, tutorials, school-based training and will recommend you for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). The university-based sessions are very much a starting point for the training undertaken in schools through observation and working alongside experienced teachers.\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Our recruitment process is shared across the partner schools within the Positive Regard Teaching School Alliance. \r\n\r\nThere is an initial selection process based on how applicants meet the qualifications and experience criteria. Should you pass this 'initial sift' successfully, then it is likely you will be called to interview.\r\nInterviews take place in our partner schools and the panel may include representatives from Positive Regard TSA and Senior Leaders from our partner schools. \r\n\r\nThe interview process is designed to enable you to show the extent to which you have the potential to become a great teacher. The interview will consist of a range of tasks designed to test your knowledge and skills in order for you to become an effective teacher. \r\n\r\nWe will inform you in advance about any pre-interview guidance for the other activities as required.\r\n\r\nDuring the interview, you will have the opportunity to meet and talk to staff and children and ask questions. Although please be aware if successful you may not be placed in the school in which the interviews are taking place. However, we do organise pre-visits to designated placement schools further into the process.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We work with Primary Schools across the region and you will have the opportunity to experience Special school settings as well. You will become part of the team allowing you to train alongside experienced and specialist teachers. \r\n\r\nYou will spend the majority of your course in one of our partner schools, supported by experienced and supportive staff, one of whom will be assigned as your host mentor. You will undertake a second contrasting placement in another of our partner schools in the first half of the Spring Term.\r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for ambitious trainee teachers who are passionate and enthusiastic about working with children, with a desire to share that with children of all abilities.\r\n\r\nWe also want our teachers to be able to effectively meet the learning needs of pupils who may have a diverse range of educational needs.\r\nExperience of working with children of this age range would be very helpful, particularly if in a school setting through previous employment or voluntary work.","otherRequirements":"Experience is not required however, we recommend that you gain some experience in order for you to become aware of what a career in teaching entails.\r\n\r\nA Disclosure Barring Service (DBS) will need to be completed. This is a requirement before commencement on the course. \r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:50:59.657Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-30T13:31:34.450Z","canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","cycle":"2024","salaryDetails":"The host school will pay the salary which will be at least the bottom of the unqualified teachers' pay scales."}
