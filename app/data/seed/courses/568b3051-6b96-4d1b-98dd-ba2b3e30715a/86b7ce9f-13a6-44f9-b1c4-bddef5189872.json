Thirty-four weeks of the programme will be spent in classrooms being exposed to outstanding teaching, and working with the Learning coach to develop effective classroom pedagogy and detailed subject knowledge. \r\nPGCE \r\nWhile some courses offer you only Qualified Teaching Status, ours will also provide you with a PGCE qualification.
