The anticipated cost for these for 2022 entry is £67*. Student teachers who have already paid for a previous DBS Enhanced Disclosure and signed up to the DBS update service (Enhanced level - Children's barred list) may pay a reduced fee (anticipated cost £27*).\r\n\r\n*Please note that as we use external companies to undertake training and checks these fees may be subject to change. Also, should you decide to withdraw your application or you do not meet the conditions of your offer, we are unable to provide a refund.\r\n\r\nAdditional costs to cover non-UK criminal clearance checks may be levied where necessary, and will be payable by the student.

Our longstanding relationships with schools enable us to ensure continuity for students, and many of our partnership schools are closely involved in the University-based parts of the course.  \r\n* A strong subject-specific cohort. You will have the chance to develop working relationships with your peers whilst in the University, which provides you with a support network once out on placement.\r\n* The chance to reflect. Teaching is an intensive profession, and at the start of your career it is essential that you have the opportunity to develop skills as a reflective practitioner. During your first placement, for example, you will spend every Friday in the University sharing your experiences and considering ways in which you can develop your teaching.\r\n\r\nAssessment\r\nYour progress in developing the skills of a teacher will be continually assessed throughout the year.  You will always be kept aware of your progress and given opportunities to focus on specific areas where necessary.  \r\n\r\nYour academic work is carefully timed to ensure that you are able to manage your workload.  Your Masters assignments are assessed by your University-based tutors, who offer extensive support and guidance to ensure that you are able to succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"\r\nOnce we receive your application we will consider a number of factors in making our decision about whether to interview you:\r\n\r\n* Do you demonstrate a clear interest in becoming a teacher?\r\n* Do you have strong references that suggest you have the capacity to train to be a teacher?\r\n* Do you have strong subject knowledge, or an awareness that you need to develop this further?\r\n* Have you written a strong personal statement, demonstrating your commitment to teaching, your passion for your subject and an understanding of the realities of the profession?\r\n\r\nWhilst school experience is not a requirement prior to interview, we tend to find that candidates are more confident during the selection process if they have spent at least some time in schools beforehand.  However, if this is not possible, you are strongly encouraged to apply for the course and arrange school experience following the selection process.  \r\n\r\nYour selection day will take place remotely using Google Meet, and will consist of the following elements:\r\n\r\n* Introduction to the course\r\n* A task designed to ensure that your subject knowledge is strong\r\n* A chance to interact with other candidates (where possible), and to reflect on this experience\r\n* A written task\r\n* A formal interview, carried out by a University tutor and a school representative\r\n\r\nYou will be sent relevant materials for the day in advance.\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will undertake four periods of school experience:\r\n\r\n* One week in a primary school early in the programme\r\n* An eight-week placement between October and December\r\n* A 13-week placement between January and May\r\n* A 2-week enrichment/enhancement placement in June\r\n\r\nIn all curriculum areas you will also have the chance to visit a number of schools as a part of the University-centred parts of the PGDE. These visits will focus on specific themes such as working with pupils with English as an Additional Language (EAL) or supporting examination groups and will give you the opportunity to gain experience of schools beyond your main placements.  Student teachers rate these visits very highly and appreciate the chance to develop a clear view of the kind of school in which they want to begin their careers.\r\n\r\nWe work with over 40 schools in Sheffield, Barnsley, Derbyshire, Doncaster, North Nottinghamshire and Rotherham. This range of inner-city, suburban and rural contexts provides rich opportunities for diverse and balanced experiences in schools, and we work hard to secure you two contrasting placements.\r\n\r\nWhen tutors are arranging placements, personal circumstances such as child-care and additional needs are taken into account as much as possible.\r\n","personalQualities":"We consider six key elements when selecting students for our PGDE programme:\r\n\r\n* Commitment to teaching\r\n* Insight into the realities of teaching\r\n* Resilience\r\n* An analytical approach to problem solving\r\n* Enthusiasm for your subject\r\n* Interpersonal and communication skills\r\n\r\nWe will consider your strengths in each area during the selection process, including when considering your application form.\r\n","otherRequirements":"As this course leads to a professional qualification, student teachers will be required to undertake a DBS Enhanced Disclosure and Work Health Assessment.
