We encourage, challenge and support trainees helping to become effective, reflective teachers whose classroom practice puts children at the centre of a creative and engaging learning process.\r\nThe Sussex approach fully integrates education theory and practice encouraging you to critically reflect on approaches to learning and teaching and develop a subject specialism.  Over the year you will be placed in two different schools and required to pass both placements. Additional assessments are via a Masters level essay submitted in February and an innovative Viva style Masters level exit interview at the end of the course.\r\nWe have developed strong partnerships with primary schools who share our philosophy of a creative and reflective approach starting with the individual child and the environment. Teachers in these schools are key members of our training team and lead on many areas of this course.\r\nThe Sussex Primary course is unique in offering a very long first school placement of six months allowing you to really get to know your school and fully understand pupil progression. Your schools are carefully selected for you by the Primary Tutor team. \r\nThe shorter second placement builds on this by applying your skills and knowledge in another setting. You will also have opportunities to explore transition with time in key Stage 3 and Foundation Stage.\r\nThe course begins in September with a stimulating full-time three week induction course on our campus to prepare you for starting your school placement. Once in school you will then spend Monday to Thursday each week training in school. On Fridays you will attend the University Campus for lectures, workshops and seminars with our team of experienced primary tutors. \r\n\r\nFurther course information \r\nhttp://www.sussex.ac.uk/education/ite/primary\r\n","interviewProcess":"","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will have a ‘home’ and ‘away’ school placements over the course of the year. You will usually start in your home school in September at the beginning of term and then go on two weeks induction at the university. After this you will be on first placement at your home school. Your average week will be 4 days at school and 1 day (a Friday) at the university. This first placement phase lasts until Easter. After Easter, you will go to your ‘away’ school. This will offer some kind of contrast to your first placement school to support your meeting the Teacher Standards. This short placement will come to at the end of May. We feel this sense of a home school supports developed professional relationships with colleagues and students anchoring your practice and development as a teacher.","personalQualities":"At Sussex we are looking for; \r\n* A passion for working with young children \r\n* A strong knowledge and understanding of Primary education, and a sound awareness of current issues in English Primary schools \r\n* Effective communication skills and good organisational ability \r\n* Experience with young people and commitment to developing individuals * Enthusiasm, energy and creativity \r\n* The ability to evaluate practice and to address your weaknesses \r\n* Initiative, flexibility and responsiveness to change\r\n * A sense of responsibility \r\n* The ability to work in a team.","otherRequirements":"We also require the following \r\n* Working with children: You must not be excluded from working with children, as a result of a criminal record or other reason.
