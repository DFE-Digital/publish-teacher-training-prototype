In these sessions you will receive practical strategies and ideas to develop your practice within the classroom. Areas of pedagogy covered within these sessions include: assessment for learning, giving effective feedback, lesson planning, behaviour-management, the ways in which pupils learn and adaptive teaching. All of our training is evidence-informed. Our fee-paying courses are awarded with QTS and PGCE carrying 60 masters credits (awarded in partnership with the University of Sussex). Our salaried and apprenticeship courses lead to QTS only.\r\nAlongside your GPS, all trainees receive subject specific training, which is led by one of the schools within the partnership. All subject hubs within the partnership have been chosen for their renowned reputation as training centres and outstanding levels of learning and teaching as well as results. Science subject studies gives trainees a weekly dedicated session focussing on subject related topics, preparing you to teach the sciences to a high level within the classroom. Areas of training include planning an effective scheme of work, experiments in the classroom, engaging science lessons as well as subject input on your non-specialist science subjects. A former Teach SouthEast science trainee commented on the science programme: “The sessions are always engaging and the lead practitioners delivering the sessions have lots of fantastic ideas for me to implement in my classroom. The programme is very bespoke to my needs as a trainee teacher. I feel a lot more confident about my non-specialist sciences as a result of the training as well”. As a Teach SouthEast trainee you will spend the majority of time in your placement school with the weekly day of training delivered by the Teach SouthEast team and their partnership of schools. For the fee-paying trainees (i.e. those not receiving a salary), the PGCE element of the course (which carries 60 masters credits) is delivered by and accredited by the University of Sussex, whose ITT provision has been graded as outstanding by Ofsted. Trainees have the opportunity to go to the SJB, Woking on a number of occasions throughout the year to access keynote lectures and the PGCE element of the course.","interviewProcess":"Once we receive your application through DfE Apply we will make a call to interview within approximately one week.
