You will usually start in your home school in September at the beginning of term and then go on two weeks induction at the university. After this you will be on first placement at your home school. Your average week will be 4 days at school and 1 day (a Friday) at the university. This first placement phase lasts until February half-term. After this one-week break, you will go to your ‘away’ school. This will offer some kind of contrast to your first placement school to support your meeting the Teacher Standards. This short placement will come to an end at Easter and then you will return to your home school for the last 6 weeks of the course. We feel this sense of a home school supports developed professional relationships with colleagues and students anchoring your practice and development as a teacher.","personalQualities":"","otherRequirements":"","status":2,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:47:05.892Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2024"}
