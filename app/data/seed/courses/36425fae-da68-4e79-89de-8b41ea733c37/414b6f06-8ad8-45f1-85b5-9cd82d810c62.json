In the last research assessment exercise, the department was rated second in the UK (REF, 2014). You will have the opportunity to work with experienced tutors who are actively engaged in research in their subject and in pedagogy more widely. \r\n74% graduates of 2021 who sought teaching posts were employed within 6 months of qualifying. \r\nIn our 2021 student survey, 100% of Computing trainees rated the quality of their training as excellent, very good or good.\r\nThe PGCE Computing at King's trains Computing professionals and graduates to become effective teachers of Computing in secondary schools. The PGCE Computing programme examines in detail the specifications and expectations for Computing in UK secondary schools including GCSE and A-Level courses.\r\n\r\nLearning to be a teacher of Computing involves:\r\n-learning about teaching the Computing knowledge, skills and processes as laid down in the National Curriculum and examination specifications for Computing, Computer Science and Information Technology.\r\n-learning how to incorporate computational thinking into other subject areas in schools.\r\n\r\nA distinctive feature of the King's Computing programme is the emphasis on learning through critical reflection and discussion with colleagues. In the same way that you will encouraged to make your students think when they are analysing computing-based issues and problems, so staff at King's are keen for you to apply your developing understanding of teaching to help you think about your own practice.\r\n\r\nAt King’s we are at the forefront of research into computing education in schools, and this research impacts on the teaching in the programme. Our staff are all active researchers and the school is host to the Nuffield funded Subject Choice, Attainment and Representation in (SCARI) Computing project.\r\n","interviewProcess":"In addition to meeting the shortlisting requirements, you must demonstrate the following if you are to be offered a place:\r\n\r\n-conceptual understanding of some school Computing\r\n-Computing knowledge of an appropriate level\r\n-ability to think and reason clearly\r\n-clarity and accuracy of written and spoken communication\r\n-successful experience with children or clear potential for this\r\n-ability to interact with pupils and colleagues\r\n-strong motivation to teach\r\n-ability to recognise own shortcomings\r\n-flexibility of mind and potential necessary to improve\r\n-ability to present ideas clearly and at an appropriate level\r\n\r\nIf you are shortlisted you will be invited to a group interview.  This process will take half a day and is designed to:\r\n\r\n-enable you to demonstrate your potential for teaching Computing\r\n-help you to decide whether Computing teaching is the right career for you.\r\n\r\nDuring the interview process you will demonstrate your potential for teaching Computing through:\r\n-subject knowledge test (including questions on algorithms and programming)\r\n-oral answers during individual interview\r\n-a brief introduction to a lesson which you prepare at the interview and present to the rest of the interview group.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will have two different school placements during the course. We work with a large number of schools around London and Greater London and we select school placements carefully, taking into account the teachers who act as mentors and the subjects they offer. \r\n\r\nWe try to ensure that all trainees have a reasonable journey to school and to ensure that you have a balanced teaching experience including the full secondary age (11-18) and ability range.","personalQualities":"Personal qualities we look for include:\r\n\r\n-Ability to engage interest and communicate your own enthusiasm for mathematics\r\n-Commitment to working with young people\r\n-Ability to explain ideas clearly and to think on your feet\r\n-Evidence of good interpersonal skills\r\n-Awareness of current educational issues\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"The Department for Education requires the Disclosure and Barring Service (formerly the Criminal Records Bureau) to vet the background of persons working in their schools. Candidates offered a place on a PGCE course will be asked to complete an enhanced check with the DBS to ensure they do not have a criminal background which might prevent them from working as a teacher. This must be completed before you register on the programme.\r\n\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:53:33.533Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-01T15:14:32.387Z","cycle":"2023","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"}
