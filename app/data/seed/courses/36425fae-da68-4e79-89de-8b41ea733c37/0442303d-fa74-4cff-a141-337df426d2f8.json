In the last research assessment exercise, the department was rated second in the UK (REF, 2014). You will have the opportunity to work with experienced tutors who are actively engaged in research in their subject and in pedagogy more widely. \r\n\r\n74% graduates of 2021 who sought teaching posts were employed within 6 months of qualifying. \r\n\r\nIn our 2021 student survey, 100% of Classics trainees rated the quality of their training as excellent or very good.\r\n\r\nThe course aims to provide a practical and theoretical context for the development of subject pedagogical knowledge for teaching Classics (Latin, alongside a combination of Greek/Classical Civilisation/Ancient History) with confidence in secondary schools.  Sessions include opportunities to explore a variety of methodologies, as well as modelling ways in which you might teach Classics in the classroom.  There are also opportunities to consider the use of drama, technology and other media, as well as learning outside the classroom.  The sessions include input from tutors and other colleagues, seminars, workshops and presentations.  Students are required to undertake research and other independent learning tasks, as well as to work in collaboration with each other and with colleagues in their school placements.\r\n","interviewProcess":"The selection process normally involves an interview, a short presentation by the candidate, a discussion and a short piece of writing.\r\n\r\nInterview\r\n\r\nIn addition to meeting the shortlisting requirements, it is desirable that you try to demonstrate the following if you are to be offered a place:\r\n\r\n-the ability to engage interest and communicate your own enthusiasm for Classics;\r\n-evidence that you have a commitment to working with young people;\r\n-commitment to inclusion;\r\n-the ability to explain ideas clearly and to think on your feet;\r\n-strong interpersonal skills;\r\n-evidence of flexibility;\r\n-interest in current educational issues;\r\n-recent observation in a non-selective state secondary school;\r\n-knowledge of Latin literature in the original;\r\n-knowledge of some aspects of the literature, history, social and political life of Greece and Rome.\r\n\r\nPresentation\r\n\r\nIn your presentation, we will be looking for:\r\n-an understanding of the subject you wish to teach;\r\n-the ability to explain concepts at a school level;\r\n-engagement with the audience;\r\n-reference to the use of simple resources (e.g. visual aids);\r\n-confidence and clarity.\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will have two different school placements during the course. We work with a large number of schools around London and Greater London and we select school placements carefully, taking into account the teachers who act as mentors and the subjects they offer. \r\n\r\nWe try to ensure that all trainees have a reasonable journey to school and to ensure that you have a balanced teaching experience including the full secondary age (11-18) and ability range.","personalQualities":"We are looking for people with:\r\n\r\n-a real enthusiasm for Classics;\r\n-commitment to teaching;\r\n-a good academic track record, including a degree in a classical subject;\r\n-a good knowledge of Latin, Classical Civilisation/ Ancient History and the potential to teach;\r\n-knowledge of Greek may be useful but is not essential;\r\n-good communication skills;\r\n-an ability to explain linguistic and non-linguistic concepts clearly;\r\n-potential to manage young people effectively;\r\n-flexibility of mind;\r\n-awareness of current educational issues;\r\n-successful experience with children or clear potential for this;\r\n-commitment to equality and inclusion;\r\n-commitment to continuous professional development.\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"The Department for Education requires the Disclosure and Barring Service (formerly the Criminal Records Bureau) to vet the background of persons working in their schools. Candidates offered a place on a PGCE course will be asked to complete an enhanced check with the DBS to ensure they do not have a criminal background which might prevent them from working as a teacher. This must be completed before you register on the programme.\r\n\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:53:33.621Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-01T15:13:49.378Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"}
