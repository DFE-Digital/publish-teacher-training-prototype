In the last research assessment exercise, the department was rated second in the UK (REF, 2014). You will have the opportunity to work with experienced tutors who are actively engaged in research in their subject and in pedagogy more widely. \r\n\r\n74% graduates of 2021 who sought teaching posts were employed within 6 months of qualifying. \r\n\r\nIn our 2021 student survey, 94% of Geography trainees rated the quality of their training as excellent.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Geography PGCE is designed to develop reflective practitioners who are equipped to teach the subject across the full secondary age range (11-18). Predominantly working through workshop-style sessions, the programme considers contemporary issues in Geography education and relevant research in the field, and explores how these are best incorporated into the effective teaching of geography to support the development of young people as informed and responsible global citizens. \r\n\r\nThe Geography PGCE programme has an emphasis on developing an enquiry approach to learning, that includes the effective and creative use of fieldwork and ICT across the curriculum.","interviewProcess":"The King's interview process includes a group discussion, a written task and an individual interview. \r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will have two different school placements during the course.
