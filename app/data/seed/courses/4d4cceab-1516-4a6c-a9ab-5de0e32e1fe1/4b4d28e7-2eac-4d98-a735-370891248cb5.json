Successful candidates are awarded Qualified  Teacher Status (QTS) and a PGCE of 90 Masters Level Credits allowing  progress onto our Part-time Masters in Education for newly qualified teachers.\r\n\r\nThe Sussex Partnership believes that language education matters. Young people need to be prepared for a world where communication with people from other countries and backgrounds is a national imperative. Studying other languages and their culture helps students to develop their understanding of their own language, fosters intercultural awareness and provides a whole host of cognitive benefits that support their wider academic achievement. It also enhances students’ career opportunities.\r\n\r\nWe take trainees from a wide variety of backgrounds and pride ourselves on the high quality programme of bespoke support we give our trainees. Our trainees are inquisitive, critically reflective and motivated to keep learning and improving their practice. They are well-prepared for the realities of teaching, with the confidence, resilience and skills to be innovative, to take risks and be creative.\r\n\r\nTrainees appreciate the creative and modern approach to language teaching which enables them to integrate theory and practice, and critically reflect on effective progress in planning, teaching and assessing successful language lessons. Our university based sessions are led by outstanding experienced practitioners from local schools as well as by university teacher educators who will share their enthusiasm and professional knowledge to provide you with opportunities to engage and enthuse your students.\r\n\r\nYou will  attend a full-time three week induction course on our campus during September  to prepare you for starting your school placement. \r\n\r\nThereafter our full-time candidates spend Monday to Thursday each week training in one of our partnership schools and attending the University Campus on Fridays for lectures, workshops and seminars with our team of experienced subject tutors. \r\n\r\nPart-time candidates also attend the university on Fridays and train for two days a week in school.\r\n\r\nOver the course you will be placed in two different schools and required to successfully complete both placements.
