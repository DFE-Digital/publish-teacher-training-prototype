Our partnership believes that introducing young people to the men and women of the classical past helps us understand not only their experiences, languages and beliefs, but also the ways in which they continue to inform and shape the way we see our own world. By dealing with the sparse and fragmented nature of historical and literacy sources challenges pupils to engage in the process of enquiry, analysis and debate. As a school subject, Classics is growing in popularity and offers schools and pupils a rich, exciting and challenging addition to the school curriculum.\r\n\r\nTogether, university teacher educators and excellent classroom practitioners share their enthusiasm and professional knowledge to give you opportunities to focus on how best to engage, enthuse and enlighten your pupils in their understandings of the past.\r\n\r\nYou will  attend a full-time three week induction course on our campus during September  to prepare you for starting your school placement. \r\n\r\nThereafter our full-time candidates spend Monday to Thursday each week training in one of our partnership schools and attending the University Campus on Fridays for lectures, workshops and seminars with our team of experienced subject tutors. \r\n\r\nPart-time candidates also attend the university on Fridays and train for two days a week in school.\r\n\r\nIntegrating education theory and practice and encouraging  critical reflection on approaches to learning and teaching is key to the Sussex approach. Excellent teachers from partnership schools are seconded to the tutor team and contribute additional currency to teaching and trainee support.\r\n\r\nOver the year you will be placed in two different schools and required to successfully pass both placements.
