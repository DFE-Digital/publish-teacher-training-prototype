We encourage, challenge and support trainees helping to become effective, reflective teachers whose classroom practice puts children at the centre of a creative and engaging learning process.\r\n\r\nThe Sussex course integrates education theory and practice encouraging you to critically reflect on approaches to learning and teaching and develop a subject specialism.  Over the year you will be placed in two different schools and required to pass both placements. Additional assessments are via a Masters level essay submitted in February and an innovative Viva style Masters level exit interview at the end of the course.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have developed strong partnerships with primary schools who share our philosophy of a creative and reflective approach starting with the individual child and the environment. Teachers in these schools are key members of our training team and lead on many areas of this course.\r\n\r\nThe Sussex Primary course is unique in offering a very long first school placement of six months allowing you to really get to know your school and fully understand pupil progression. Your schools are carefully selected for you by the Primary Tutor team. \r\n\r\nThe shorter second placement builds on this by applying your skills and knowledge in another setting. You will also have opportunities to explore transition with time in key Stage 3 and Foundation Stage\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will  attend an exciting full-time three week induction course on our campus during September in preparation for starting your school placement. \r\n\r\nFull-time candidates then spend Monday to Thursday each week training school and attending the University Campus on Fridays for lectures, workshops and seminars with our team of experienced primary tutors. \r\n\r\nPart-time candidates also attend the university on Fridays but train for two days a week in school in year 1 and three days in year 2 with days individually negotiated with your school.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther course information \r\nhttp://www.sussex.ac.uk/education/ite/primary\r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Applicants who meet the entry requirements will be invited to an online selection day.\r\n\r\nAs part of the interview process Sussex candidates would usually expect to;\r\n\r\nBefore the day \r\n* Listen to a video talk giving further information about the Sussex course\r\n* Complete some paperwork including our 'Suitability for Teaching Declaration'. \r\nBoth the above will be sent to you by email in your invitation to interview\r\n\r\nOn the selection day \r\n* An individual online interview, usually via Zoom, with a Sussex tutor and an experienced  teacher from a partnership school\r\n* Deliver a short pre-prepared classroom type teaching task or presentation to the panel.
