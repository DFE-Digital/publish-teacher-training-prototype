You will deepen your own grammatical understanding and that of your pupils, enabling them to become creative, effective writers. Exploratory talk about texts is also central to developing pupils' talk and writing, combined with rich, textual models.\r\n\r\nAt the centre of contemporary culture the study of the media enriches young peoples understanding of their place in the world and is essential for their active participation in society as critical consumers. The course offers a strong grounding in theoretical and practical aspects of school based media study developing your practical skills using industry standard hardware and software. There are opportunities to develop your own understanding of key media debates and pedagogy whilst developing your own classroom practice.\r\n\r\nThe Sussex course brings together education theory and practice encouraging you to critically reflect on approaches to learning and teaching. Excellent teachers from our partnership schools are seconded to the tutor team and contribute additional currency to teaching and trainee support.   \r\n\r\nYou will  attend a full-time three week induction course on our campus during September to prepare you for starting your school placement. \r\n\r\nYou will spend Monday to Thursday each week training in a partnership school and attending the University Campus on Fridays for lectures, workshops and seminars with our team of experienced subject tutors. \r\n\r\nOver the year you will be placed in two different schools and required to pass both placements.
