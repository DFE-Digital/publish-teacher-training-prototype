Successful candidates will be awarded Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and a PGCE of 90 Masters Level Credits allowing  progress onto our Part-time Masters in Education for newly qualified teachers.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of our Computer Science PGCE is a belief in the importance of heuristic learning and creativity. Enabling learners to become independent, critical thinkers who develop expertise in formulating problems and their solutions is crucial. Helping them to identify and talk about scenarios with teachers and peers leads to success not only in Computer Science, but in other areas of the curriculum and life in general.\r\n\r\nYou will learn how to develop the computational thinking skills of your learners, developing connections between your knowledge and passion for computing and the importance of trial and error, reflection, analysis and evaluation. You will help learners become the creators of technology, not just users of technology, by understanding the role of computing in the classroom, teaching and learning theory, moral and social issues arising from the widespread use of computers and, of course, the teaching of the Computing National Curriculum and examinations at both GCSE and GCSE level. Opportunities to study and reflect with other trainees ensure you are part of an invaluable network of peer support.\r\n\r\nThe Sussex course brings together education theory and practice encouraging you to critically reflect on approaches to learning and teaching. Excellent teachers from partnership schools are seconded to the tutor team and contribute additional currency to teaching and trainee support.   \r\n\r\nYou will  attend a full-time three week induction course on our campus during September  to prepare you for starting your school placement. \r\n\r\nOur full-time candidates spend Monday to Thursday each week training in one of our partnership schools and attending the University Campus on Fridays for lectures, workshops and seminars with our team of experienced subject tutors. Part-time candidates also attend the university on Fridays and train for two days a week in school.\r\n\r\nOver the year you will be placed in two different schools and will be required to pass both placements. Additional assessments are via a Masters level essay submitted in late February and an innovative Viva style Masters level exit interview at the end of the course.\r\n\r\nFurther course information http://www.sussex.ac.uk/education/ite/pgceandschooldirectsecondary/computerscience \r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Applicants who meet the entry requirements will be invited to a Sussex selection day either online via Zoom or in person at the university campus in Brighton.\r\n\r\nAs part of the interview process Sussex candidates would usually  expect to;\r\n\r\nBefore the selection day \r\n* Listen to a video talk giving further information about the Sussex course\r\n* Complete some paperwork including our 'Suitability for Teaching Declaration'. \r\nBoth the above will be sent to you by email in your invitation to interview\r\n\r\nOn the selection day \r\n* Have an individual online interview, usually via Zoom, with a Sussex tutor and an experienced  teacher from a partnership school\r\n* Deliver a short pre-prepared classroom type teaching task or presentation to the panel.
