Successful candidates are awarded Qualified  \r\nTeacher Status (QTS) and a PGCE of 90 Masters Level Credits allowing  progress onto our Part-time Masters in Education for newly qualified teachers.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of the English PGCE course at Sussex is a belief in the importance of reading. Enabling pupils to become independent, critical readers who love reading and talking about texts with teachers and peers will allow them to succeed in all other areas of the English - and indeed the school - curriculum. Therefore, you will gain understanding of how to develop the reading abilities of your pupils, drawing connections between your own knowledge and love of literature and the comprehension strategies and exposure to challenging texts that will enable your pupils to become similarly enthusiastic, engaged readers. Exploratory talk about texts is also central to developing pupils' talk and writing, combined with rich, textual models. You will deepen your own grammatical understanding and that of your pupils, enabling them to become creative, effective writers.\r\n\r\nIntegrating education theory and practice and encouraging  critical reflection on approaches to learning and teaching is key to the Sussex approach. Excellent teachers from partnership schools are seconded to the tutor team and contribute additional currency to teaching and trainee support.   \r\n\r\nYou will  attend a full-time three week induction course on our campus during September  to prepare you for starting your school placement. \r\n\r\nThereafter our full-time candidates spend Monday to Thursday each week training in one of our partnership schools and attending the University Campus on Fridays for lectures, workshops and seminars with our team of experienced subject tutors. Part-time candidates also attend the university on Fridays and train for two days a week in school.\r\n\r\nOver the course you will be placed in two different schools and will be required to pass both placements. Additional assessments are via a Masters level essay submitted in late February and an innovative Viva style Masters level exit interview at the end of the course.\r\n\r\nSEND Placement\r\n\r\nFurther course information \r\nhttp://www.sussex.ac.uk/education/ite/pgceandschooldirectsecondary/english\r\n\r\nEnglish Subject Knowledge Enhancement Course\r\nhttp://www.sussex.ac.uk/education/ite/ske\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Applicants who meet the entry requirements will be invited to a Sussex selection day either online via Zoom or in person at the university campus in Brighton. \r\n\r\nAs part of the interview process Sussex candidates would usually expect to;\r\n\r\nBefore the selection day \r\n* Listen to a video talk giving further information about the Sussex course\r\n* Complete some paperwork including our 'Suitability for Teaching Declaration'. \r\nBoth the above will be sent to you by email in your invitation to interview\r\n\r\nOn the selection day \r\n* Have an individual online interview, usually via Zoom, with a Sussex tutor and an experienced  teacher from a partnership school\r\n* Deliver a short pre-prepared classroom type teaching task or presentation to the panel.
