Our partnership believes that introducing young people to psychology provides them with a valuable and insightful way of seeing our world and the ways in which individuals operate and integrate.\r\n\r\nBy dealing with data, evidence and research methods, pupils are challenged to engage in the process of enquiry, analysis and debate. As a school subject, Psychology is growing in popularity and offers schools and pupils a rich, exciting and challenging addition to the school curriculum.\r\n\r\nBuilding on successful and engaging practice in GCSE and A Level Psychology school classrooms University and school-based sessions draw on local and national expertise, offering perspectives and strategies on a range of different teaching issues, from key Psychology topics: memory, personality and communication, to engaging pupils in the sensitive, controversial and emotive nature of subjects like deviance and ethics.\r\n\r\nIntegrating education theory and practice and encouraging  critical reflection on approaches to learning and teaching is key to the Sussex approach. Excellent teachers from partnership schools are seconded to the tutor team and contribute additional currency to teaching and trainee support.   \r\n\r\nYou will  attend a full-time three week induction course on our campus during September  to prepare you for starting your first school placement. \r\n\r\nThereafter our full-time candidates spend Monday to Thursday each week training in one of our partnership schools and attending the University Campus on Fridays for lectures, workshops and seminars with our team of experienced subject tutors.
