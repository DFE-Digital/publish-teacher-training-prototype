At Sussex we recognise that effective Science teaching is about enabling pupils think for themselves and question. The central aim of the course is to develop committed, thoughtful and effective Science teachers who will encourage their pupils to challenge  and enjoy their learning experience. \r\n\r\nThe course enables you to teach the broad, balanced science courses offered in schools up to GCSE, in addition to developing particular teaching expertise in your specialist subject, Biology. Teaching at the University is modelled on the most successful, creative and active methods of learning that trainees need to develop in schools.\r\n\r\nScience courses at Sussex are among the most established within Initial Teacher Education in the UK, and have a well-deserved reputation for developing successful specialist teachers. The commitment of many local Science teachers to our course has enhanced the quality over the years. \r\n\r\nThe Sussex course brings together education theory and practice encouraging you to critically reflect on approaches to learning and teaching. Excellent teachers from our partnership schools are seconded to the tutor team and contribute additional currency to teaching and trainee support.   \r\n\r\nYou will  attend a full-time three week induction course on our campus during September in preparation for starting your school placement. \r\n\r\nFull-time candidates spend Mondays to Thursdays training in one of our partnership schools and attending the University Campus on Fridays for lectures, workshops and seminars with our team of experienced subject tutors. Part-time candidates also attend the university on Fridays and train for two days a week in school in year 1 and three days in year 2.\r\n\r\nOver the year you will be placed in two different schools and required to pass both placements. Additional assessments are via a Masters level essay submitted in late February and an innovative Viva style Masters level exit interview at the end of the course.\r\n\r\nSubject knowledge Enhancement Courses are available prior to the PGCE for those with related degrees and/or who need to develop specialist knowledge. \r\nhttp://www.sussex.ac.uk/education/ite/ske\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther course information \r\nhttp://www.sussex.ac.uk/education/ite/pgceandschooldirectsecondary/science\r\n","interviewProcess":"Applicants who meet the entry requirements will be invited to a Sussex selection day either online via zoom or in person on campus.\r\n\r\nAs part of the interview process Sussex candidates can expect to;\r\n\r\nBefore the selection day \r\n* Listen to a video talk giving further information about the Sussex course\r\n* Complete some paperwork including our 'Suitability for Teaching Declaration'. \r\nBoth the above will be sent to you by email in your invitation to interview\r\n\r\nOn the selection day \r\n* Have an individual online interview, usually via Zoom, with a Sussex tutor and an experienced  teacher from a partnership school\r\n* Deliver a short pre-prepared classroom type teaching task or presentation to the panel.
