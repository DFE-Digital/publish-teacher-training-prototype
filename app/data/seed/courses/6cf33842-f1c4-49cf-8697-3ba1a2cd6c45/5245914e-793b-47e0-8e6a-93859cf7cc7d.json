During your PGCE, you will get to grips with up-to-date thinking and the latest research in teaching and learning. You'll benefit from our expertise as a leading centre for curriculum development, professional training and research.\r\n\r\nTrainees come to the course with a range of qualifications, employment backgrounds and interests. Throughout the course you will be encouraged to work collaboratively, sharing your experience, knowledge and technical expertise. Activities emphasise teamwork and require you to share the responsibility for your learning.\r\n\r\nThroughout the course, you will be guided by mentors in your placement schools and supported by your university tutors.\r\n\r\nSchool experience forms the backbone of the PGCE course and a large proportion of the training year is spent in placement schools. Trainees will complete a two-week primary school placement at the start of the course, a two-day per week placement in the first term, plus two four week teaching placement blocks in their first placement school and a nine week block teaching placement in a second school.\r\n\r\nTrainees complete three Masters-level written assignments (one per term) during the PGCE course on themes such as lesson observation and teaching evaluation. This course is worth 60 Masters-level credits (each module is worth 20 credits), which you can put towards a Masters degree through accreditation for prior credited learning (APCL). The practical teaching requirements and formal written assignments are designed not just to provide evidence that trainees have reached the required Teachers' Standards but also as useful learning activities in themselves. Assessment is continuous, across all aspects of the course.\r\n\r\nOur secondary PGCE programmes prepare trainees to teach across the 11-16 age range. As part of the Post-16 Enhancement we offer trainees a range of experiences to develop their knowledge, understanding and skills for teaching at Post 16.\r\n\r\nIn its most recent evaluation, the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted) awarded our PGCE programme a Grade 2: Good.\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"All shortlisted applicants will be invited to attend a selection process. \r\n\r\nThe selection process comprises of a range of activities including: \r\n\r\n- a briefing on the course structure\r\n- a short presentation regarding how you would use an item or artefact to enhance learning in a secondary classroom\r\n- a written task to test your subject knowledge\r\n- an individual panel interview \r\n\r\nYou will be interviewed by members of the PGCE team from the University and colleagues from partner organisations (e.g. current and former teachers, local authority partners, etc.) Full details of the selection arrangements will be supplied to all candidates invited to interview.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Over the course of the year you will undertake two school placements. These offer opportunities to learn from experienced teachers and hone your professional skills. You'll spend time observing and supporting lessons, before moving on to teach lessons by yourself, building up to a 50% teaching timetable by the end of your first placement.\r\n\r\nIn your second placement you'll take responsibility for teaching classes, supervised by an experienced teacher. You'll gain experience teaching students of different ages and abilities, helping with assessment, coursework and examinations, as well as parents' evenings and school outings.\r\n\r\nOver your two placements you'll have opportunities to observe, plan, teach and assess pupils at a wide range of attainment in Key Stage 3 and 4. You'll also get some experience teaching at post-16 level. \r\n\r\nYou'll be expected to get involved in wider school life by, for example, working as a form tutor, taking part in meetings, contributing to extracurricular activities and communicating with parents and carers.","personalQualities":"During our recruitment of PGCE candidates, we are looking for applicants who demonstrate a genuine passion for entering the teaching profession, an awareness of current education issues and enthusiasm for their subject.
