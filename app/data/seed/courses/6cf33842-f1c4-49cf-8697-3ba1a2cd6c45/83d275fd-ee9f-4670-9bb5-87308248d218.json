Our school-centred (School Direct) PGCE secondary programme is a community of learning with partnership at the heart of the programme.  The partnership works together to develop outstanding student teachers who are transformative and creative professionals, highly motivated and committed, autonomous and independent, enquiry based practitioners and self-reflective practitioners. The programme delivers contemporary and highly relevant education and training which provides excellent opportunities for you to develop knowledge and understanding of your subject and wider educational issues.  You will be equipped to become an outstanding teacher and leader with strong subject knowledge and a clear professional identity.  You will be supported by experts in both university and schools to ensure that you have opportunities to learn about current classroom practice and develop deep subject pedagogy.  The programme combines school experience with taught sessions on subject knowledge and pedagogy which occur at university and also in partnership schools. Two academic assignments will need to be passed so you meet the programme aims and gain the PGCE award.  These modules will underpin your own rigorous understanding of pedagogy and will provide you with 60 Masters level credits, which you may wish to use towards a full Masters qualification in the future.\r\n\r\nThe programme ensures that you fulfil the requirements of the current Teachers’ Standards for the award of QTS. The programme encourages you to engage critically with educational issues to enable you to develop as a reflective practitioner, with the ability to evaluate and adapt your practice to meet the diverse needs of pupils in secondary schools.  This is achieved through a range of learning, teaching and assessment strategies, including active learning and enquiry-based learning, which is considered essential in both modelling effective learning and teaching practice.\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"The recruitment process is designed to enable All Saints RC School and York St John University to assess the suitability of candidates for training and to appoint the best candidates for the places available.  \r\n\r\nSelection is based on evidence given throughout the application process and includes:\r\n•\tYour personal statement\r\n•\tReferences\r\n•\tDetailed breakdown of degree content\r\n•\tDetails of other academic, professional or vocational qualifications\r\n•\tCompletion of a practical task at interview\r\n•\tOverall performance at interview\r\n\r\nInterview days take place in one of our partnership schools.

There is also a 6-week contrasting placement in a different partnership school, either in the autumn or spring term.
