Your studies will focus on addressing the needs of pupils aged eleven to sixteen and beyond. \r\n\r\nThe quality of teacher training in secondary education was rated as 'Good' in the Ofsted report for Initial Teacher Education 2016. The report found that, \"Scientists appreciate the enhancement groups where they further build on their knowledge by sharing each other's expertise. As a consequence, the trainees' and newly qualified teachers' enthusiasm and confidence in the subjects they teach motivate and inspire pupils to learn and make progress.\"\r\n\r\n98% of students indicated that the programme prepared them for teaching learners across a range of abilities and 98% of students indicated that the programme helped them secure employment.\r\n\r\nAs part of your PGCE, you will have the opportunity to gain 60 Masters-level credits and gain Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).\r\n\r\nWe work in collaboration with professionals from specialist science organisations such as the Royal Society of Biology. We also partner with the adventure learning charity, Wide Horizons, who will support your training in the area of field work, conservation and ecology.
