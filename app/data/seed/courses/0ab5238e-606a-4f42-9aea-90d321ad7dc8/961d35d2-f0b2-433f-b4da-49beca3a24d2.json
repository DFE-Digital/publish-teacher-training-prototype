As History is often perceived as a \"difficult\" subject it is important that teachers make learning both accessible and interesting for all students' abilities, while maintaining academic rigour. Trainee teachers of History will learn how to teach the core analytical skills that cover all periods of History; with such a vast content to choose from it is impossible to cover everything in a school curriculum, but it is essential that those wishing to teach have a broad general knowledge of British History (especially the Stuart era) and also 19th century American History (especially the Civil War). Flexibility is equally necessary, as is passion for the past and its relevance to the present and future, in order to inspire students. Given the emphasis on literacy for the subject, a high standard of literacy for all potential History teachers is also essential.\r\n\r\nThis course will allow you to achieve Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).\r\n\r\nQTS is awarded by Haybridge Alliance SCITT and involves you gathering evidence against each of the Teacher Standards.  \r\n\r\nTrainees will spend a minimum of 120 days in school working towards the award of QTS.\r\n\r\nTrainees will also benefit from Professional Studies and Subject Pedagogy sessions that are led by a Subject Specialist.  It is your responsibility to secure the required fundamental English and Mathematics skills and we will support you in this process to ensure you can demonstrate competence in the required fundamental English and Mathematics to gain QTS.","interviewProcess":"During the day, we assess different skills via various tasks.
