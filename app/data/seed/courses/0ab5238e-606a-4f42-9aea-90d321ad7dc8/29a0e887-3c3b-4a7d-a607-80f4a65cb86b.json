","aboutCourse":"Secondary Chemistry (Age Range 11 – 16)\r\nChemistry is the most fundamental of sciences and plays a vital role in everyday life through improving living standards. It is the study of the composition, properties and behaviour of matter and is concerned with atoms and their interactions with other atoms.  Teaching chemistry is a massive challenge that requires great talent, but the rewards are equally great. Chemistry is one of the few subjects that allows scope for activities that inspire genuine awe and wonder in the classroom. The course will help you develop the skills to excel as a Chemistry teacher, teach Chemistry with differing degrees of complexity to a wide range of students, consider how best to provide an environment for effective teaching and learning, work at enhancing your own knowledge and understanding of Chemistry, develop strategies for effectively communicating chemical concepts to students, prepare and critically evaluate resources for the teaching of Chemistry.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis course will allow you to achieve Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) at the end of a two-year period.\r\n\r\nYou will be expected to work on average 3 days a week, which will comprise of days in school, professional study sessions, subject pedagogy sessions and self-directed study time.\r\n\r\nYou will spend a minimum of 140 days in school over the next 2 years.\r\nMondays are mandatory and will be mainly professional study days whilst there is some flexibility with the other 2 days.\r\n\r\nThis flexible approach means you can fit training to become a qualified teacher around other commitments, offering a more gradual introduction into the profession.  \r\n\r\nTrainees will also benefit from Professional Studies and Subject Pedagogy sessions that are led by a Subject Specialist.  It is your responsibility to secure the required fundamental English and Mathematics skills and we will support you in this process to ensure you can demonstrate competence in the required fundamental English and Mathematics to gain QTS.\r\n","interviewProcess":"During the day, we assess different skills via various tasks.
