","aboutCourse":"The course will begin in September 2022 and last for one academic year with a trainees time being divided between school based placements (approximately 80%) and structured training days (approximately 20%) which will take place at either Hales Valley Teaching Hub or at one of our partner organisations (Haybridge Teaching School Alliance) and focus upon key educational theory and practice. \r\n\r\nOn the 44 week programme a trainee’s time is divided between Teaching Experiences and structured training sessions looking at subject delivery and wider professional issues. The teaching commitment will build up over the year: 30-40% in the Autumn term, 50% in the Spring and 80% in the Summer term. During the course trainees will be supported by their school-based practitioner who will be a good or outstanding teacher and leader within the school.\r\n\r\nTrainees will be assessed on a combination of evidence gathered during the teaching experiences, a range of tasks linked to Hales Valley/partnership workshops as well as three formal assignments that focus on key areas of teaching and learning.","interviewProcess":"","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"SCITT is a school-led training course which gives you the chance to learn ‘on the job’ in a school. You work as part of the teaching team from day one, learning from experienced, highly-skilled colleagues and you immediately put your new skills into practice.\r\nYou spend on average 80% of the week in one of our 20 primary partnership schools teaching in Early Years and Key Stage 1. \r\nWe have worked very closely with our partnership schools over the last eight years and have excellent relationships with them. They share our ethos, understanding the importance and value of school led teacher training.\r\nYou will have two school experiences throughout the year ensuring you gain experience in both Early Years and Key Stage 1 enabling you to teach 3-7 year olds.  You spend your first and last school experience in the same class, in the same school. Your second school placement is in different school ensuring you gain a wider experience in your training. \r\nYou also spend time in Key Stage 2 in order to gain further experience.","personalQualities":"","otherRequirements":"Successful candidates will be required to carry out an enhanced DBS check before commencing the programme.
