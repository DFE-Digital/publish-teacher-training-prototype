The teaching commitment will build up over the year: 50% in the Autumn term, 60% in the Spring term and 80% in the Summer term. During the course trainees will be supported by their school-based practitioner who will be a good or outstanding teacher and leader within the school.\r\n\r\nTrainees will be assessed on a combination of evidence gathered during the teaching experiences, a range of tasks linked to Hales Valley/partnership workshops as well as three formal assignments that focus on key areas of teaching and learning.","interviewProcess":"","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"School direct is a school-led training course which gives you the chance to learn ‘on the job’ in a school.
