The interview will take place at a number of schools, depending on available spaces. \r\n\r\nFull details of the interview process, including any written tests, venues and times will be sent to applicants at least a week in advance of the interview date. Applicants will know, prior to interview, which school(s) they are being interviewed for.\r\n\r\nThe interview will normally include a short teaching activity, usually between 20 – 30 minutes, delivered to a small group of pupils. Applicants will always be informed about the topic for the teaching activity and the age group/ability of the students. \r\n\r\nThere are a set number of places available for each programme, so we recommend that you apply as early as possible to give yourself the best chance of obtaining a place.

All schools have comprehensive intakes and you will gain valuable experience of working with young people of all abilities.
