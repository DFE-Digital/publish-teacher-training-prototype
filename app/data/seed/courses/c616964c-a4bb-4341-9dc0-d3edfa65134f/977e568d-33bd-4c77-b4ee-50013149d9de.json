This will be a 4 week placement \r\n\r\n\r\nIn each Phase of Classroom Practice you will spend 4 days in school from Monday - Thursday. Every Friday is a training day at the training centre based at the John Taylor High School. In the morning all trainees undertake general professional studies training. \r\n\r\nOur Subject Pedagogy Tutor for Mathematics is an outstanding teacher of Maths. Working in small groups, you will explore how to apply general high quality principles of teaching and learning within a Mathematics context whilst enhancing your subject knowledge in identified areas.\r\nOur vision for Mathematics teaching and learning is to foster positive attitudes towards  Mathematics, share our appreciation for the beauty and power of Mathematics and to encourage pupils to understand the connections between different areas of Mathematics. We want pupils to become fluent in the fundamentals of Mathematics, to reason mathematically and to solve problems by applying their Mathematics to a variety of problems.\r\n\r\nIf you share our vision and passion for the teaching and learning of Mathematics we would welcome your application for our SCITT programme.\r\n\r\nSchool and subject based tasks support face to face training sessions and you will have the opportunity to share experiences with other during the reflect and review sessions on training days. \r\n\r\nThere will be 3 main assessment points throughout the year and by the end of the year you will need to demonstrate and evidence that you have fully met each of the eight Standards for Qualified Teacher Status as well as Part 2 of The Standards. A Teaching Standards and Subject Knowledge viva at the end of the programme will provide you with the opportunity to demonstrate how you have developed your Mathematics subject knowledge over the course of the year.   ","interviewProcess":"If your application meets the requirements of the programme you will be invited to attend an interview either remotely via an online interview or in person  at John Taylor High School training centre, where you will be interviewed by a panel consisting of representatives of the SCITT Team, a representative from a partner school  or a subject specialist. \r\nPrior to interview we will ask you to complete a subject knowledge audit and undertake a small amount of research in preparation for the interview.\r\n\r\nOn the interview day we will ask you to:\r\n* complete a literacy and numeracy test\r\n* deliver a five minute presentation \r\n* plan a short teaching activity for a small group of KS3 pupils. In this activity we are only looking to assess your ability to breakdown a concept to enable children to learn, your presence and professionalism and your ability to interact with pupils.\r\n* have a personal interview in which we will explore your reasons for wanting to become a teacher, your understanding of what it means to be a teacher and what constitutes outstanding teaching and learning.\r\n\r\nThere will a be an information session prior to the formal interview when we go through the programme with you in detail and provide an informal opportunity for you to ask any questions that you may have about our programme. \r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Our programme is an 11-16 programme with post 16 enhancement and so you will have to teach across KS3 and 4 and according to your aspirations and confidence acquire Post 16 experience as well. We strongly encourage all our partners to provide a KS5 teaching experience for our trainees, as we believe that this enhances  employability which is extremely important to us. \r\n\r\nYour Home School, where you start and end your training, will oversee the whole of your training year and communication between your home School and second placement mentor is very important to us to ensure a smooth transition between the phases. To that end both mentors will be involved in your end of phase 1 and 2 assessments and transition information shared.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"To be successful on our programme, you need to have excellent subject knowledge and be highly motivated, with a real passion for teaching and your subject. You should be able to demonstrate a good understanding of what it means to be a teacher, ideally through school experience and be able to evidence resilience and good organisational skills. It is important that you can work effectively as part of a team, are a good listener and receptive to constructive criticism","otherRequirements":"* An Enhanced DBS check and related safeguarding checks will be carried out no more than three months in advance of the course start date by the employing school.\r\n* All applicants will be subject to medical clearance checks.\r\n* Upon interview we will review your GCSE and Degree certificates.
