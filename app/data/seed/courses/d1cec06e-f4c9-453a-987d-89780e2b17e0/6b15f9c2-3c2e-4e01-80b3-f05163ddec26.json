This is a full time course where you will become part of the staff team, observing, supporting and team teaching alongside highly skilled practitioners. You experience first-hand the wider professional responsibilities of a teacher as you become involved in after school clubs, CPD events and a range of whole school events. Students will spend 3 days per week in their host schools when not on placement.\r\n\r\nAlongside this you will receive 2 day per week of high quality training around pedagogy and practice delivered by experienced teachers and University tutors.\r\n\r\nOpportunities for trainees to work or study collaboratively will be a focus of our training programme. We also provide opportunities to attend relevant conferences and CPD events as well as team building activities across the year. \r\n\r\nSEND Students will spend each term in a different school ( 2x Specialist and 1x mainstream) undertaking an assessed placement in each setting. Students will have a mentor in each school. Our mentors are mentor trained by the University of Cumbria and attend regular meetings with our course leads. Further support is also available through the University Partnership Lead and the Programme Partnership  Lead.\r\n\r\nOur Primary PGCE with QTS programme is run in partnership with the University of Cumbria. During this course you will undertake two 30-credit masters level modules to gain a PGCE. These modules are practically focused and titled ‘Building Professional Understanding’ and ‘Enhancing Professional Practice’’. They involve a total of 3 written assessments, one of which is a formative piece to support your academic development. The modules are taught by University of Cumbria lecturers who ensure that theory and practice are closely entwined to inform your teaching and provide a toolkit to take forward in your career. \r\n\r\nThis collaborative approach to teacher training ensures that students have access to both excellent school-based practice and well-regarded academic input which has been planned to create a coherent and valuable learning experience. This training is delivered by the University of Cumbria within an alliance school based in Blackpool.\r\n\r\nThis programme is in its 6th year and we are extremely proud of our 100% pass rate.\r\n","interviewProcess":"\r\nBlackpool Sea View Trust works in conjunction with the University of Cumbria to select suitable candidates to take through to our interview process.
