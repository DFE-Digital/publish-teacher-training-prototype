We will use our Subject Knowledge Development programme to ensure that you have all the necessary skills to plan and deliver the National Curriculum across Key Stages One and Two whilst also meeting the needs of all learners. During your placements, you will develop your pedagogy and practice through working alongside highly experienced school colleagues who have taught successfully in Primary schools for many years. In addition to being placed in two contrasting Primary schools, we also provide you with experience in a Secondary school in order to give you a deeper understanding of what you are building the pupils towards. Throughout the programme, you will work closely with your Professional Mentor, Mentor and Subject Lead to ensure that you get all the support you need to become an excellent teacher.\r\n\r\nAssessment for Qualified Teacher Status will be against our curriculum, the Core Content Framework, and ultimately, the Teachers’ Standards.  You will submit weekly evidence that demonstrates your progress in the classroom, as well as reflections on your training.  You will also receive regular and supportive feedback on your teaching from experienced colleagues.  For the PGCE element, which runs seamlessly alongside your school-based practice, you will complete two research-based university assignments; guidance and support for both QTS and PGCE will be offered throughout the year. ","interviewProcess":"Our interview process is currently offered online. Because of our close relationship with our partner schools we may also be able to offer a school experience to applicants by negotiation.\r\n\r\nYou will usually be interviewed by a senior tutor of GORSE SCITT, a Subject Lead of GORSE SCITT and/or a Senior Leader from a partner school.\r\n\r\n•\tYou will make a short 3-5 minute presentation about why you want to teach and what you will bring to teaching; you should engage with the panel or pupils making clear why you want to be a teacher. \r\n\r\n•\tYou will participate in a lesson with a fully qualified teacher, interacting with students, helping them, answering questions and assisting the teacher with the lesson.\r\n\r\n•\tYou will have a formal interview which will give you the opportunity to discuss why you want to be a teacher, what you would bring to the profession, and also show us your resilience and initiative.\r\n\r\n•\tYou will be asked to complete a range of written work. These will include subjects such as current issues facing education, reasons for your subject being part of the curriculum, your desire to teach, the importance of safeguarding, and subject knowledge questions.\r\n\r\n•\tAfter your interview, we aim to let you know if you have been successful within 48 hours.\r\n\r\n•\tIf we regard you as a strong candidate who needs further development to be ready to join our programme we will facilitate this through our Subject Knowledge Enhancement programmes.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"All of our carefully selected placement schools are detailed on our website.  We have worked hard to ensure that you will complete a minimum of two contrasting placements, each designed and personalised so that you will make real progress during the year.  Because of the rewarding and mutually-beneficial relationship between GORSE SCITT and its partner schools, your placements are guaranteed; you will not be offered a place on our programme if we do not have a quality placement experience to offer you.  We will organise and make all your placement arrangements for you.  In addition to your placements, your central and subject training will focus on what excellent classroom practice looks like, whilst always ensuring that you are aware of what effective and relevant evidenced-based practice looks like.   You will be taught how to take a reflective and analytical view of your teaching and know how to make effective progress.  You will work alongside, and be mentored by, a range of expert and experienced colleagues – Subject Leads, Professional Mentors, Placement Mentors and the SCITT team – who will all ensure that by the end of your training you are able to teach in any setting, in any context and in any location.\r\n\r\nYou will experience and teach across two key stages.
