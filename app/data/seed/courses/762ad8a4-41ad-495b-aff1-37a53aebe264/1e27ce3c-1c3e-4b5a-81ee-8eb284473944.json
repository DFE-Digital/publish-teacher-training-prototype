","interviewProcess":"Applications need to be made to the Partnership who, in collaboration with Partner schools, complete an initial sifting process.\r\n\r\nBy applying, applicants are confirming that their details can be shared with relevant Partner Schools under current Data Protection regulations. \r\n\r\nApplicants will then be informed by the Partnership if they have progressed to the schools' recruitment process or not. \r\n\r\nIn-school assessments will include tests of literacy and numeracy skills, an interaction with pupils and an interview with either phase or subject specialists and senior Alliance colleagues. If successful at that stage, applicants would receive information from the Partnership about the next steps in their application. \r\n\r\nWhere possible, Primary applicants would be given the opportunity to select the area that they would like to be based in and would then be contacted by Partner schools in that area to arrange a time to meet them to discuss their application.\r\n\r\nOur Alliances of schools then make the final decisions and will either (hopefully) confirm their offer of a training place in their school or, if not, provide reasons for not supporting an applicant. \r\n\r\nIf successful, the Partnership will then work with the school to make arrangements for induction onto the training programme to start in September. Part of this will involve starting to get to know the training school that you'll be based in initially and will also include two induction days in June/July. \r\n\r\nFurther information can be found at: [Doncaster ITT](www.doncasteritt.co.uk)\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Our two school Alliances are:\r\n-\tWoodfield Primary is the Lead School for ‘Partners in Learning’ with over 100 schools in the Alliance;\r\n-\tHall Cross Academy heads up ‘DRAFTTs’ (Doncaster Regional Alliance For Teacher Training Secondary), an Alliance representing the majority of Doncaster’s larger Secondary academies.\r\n\r\nTrainees will be based in one training school for their 1st term, a genuinely ‘contrasting’ placement school for the majority of the 2nd term and then either: return to their initial training school; stay on in their 2nd placement or in some cases move to a 3rd placement school for the final term, based on their individual training needs.\r\n\r\nAll placements are in Doncaster schools and all training is delivered within the Borough, including the optional PGCE programme, if completed.\r\n\r\nPrimary training can either be ages:\r\n•\t3 to 7 (Foundation Stage & Key Stage 1) or;\r\n•\t5 to 11 (Key Stages 1 & 2) and;\r\n•\tSecondary training is 11 to 16/18 (Key Stages 3 & 4 with some KS5 experience).","personalQualities":"Applicants must be competent in Fundamental English and Mathematics and will be assessed for their ability to:\r\n-\tspeak, listen and communicate using standard English grammar (clear pronunciation and vocabulary);\r\n-\tread fluently;\r\n-\twrite clearly and legibly (correct spelling and punctuation); \r\n-\tcomplete mathematical calculations fluently (whole numbers, fractions, decimals and percentages);\r\n-\tsolve mathematical problems using a variety of methods and approaches (estimating, rounding, sense checking answers, breaking down problems, explaining and justifying answers using appropriate language).\r\n\r\nHigh-quality applicants will have had some classroom experience and will exhibit a genuine passion for teaching and supporting children’s learning.\r\n","otherRequirements":"Applicants must not have failed or withdrawn from a previous ITT programme unless there are exceptional circumstances, which must be discussed with schools. \r\n\r\nAs per any role in a school, you will have to complete a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS), prohibition, disqualification and health checks before taking up a training place.\r\n\r\nGood luck with your applications!","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:54:24.670Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-21T12:41:38.745Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"}
