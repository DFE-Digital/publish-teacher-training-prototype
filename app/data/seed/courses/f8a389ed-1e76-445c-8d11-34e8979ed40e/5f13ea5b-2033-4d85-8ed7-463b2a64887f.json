The course lasts for approximately ten months and is divided into three stages, each with the emphasis on being School Centred.\r\n\r\nSkills in English is essential for all forms of communication in today’s society and it is vital that today’s youngsters are able to express themselves across a range of challenging contexts. As a teacher of English you will be instrumental in opening up the power of our language to your students, encouraging them to be practical, logical, creative and imaginative with their words, both written and spoken. Today’s secondary English curriculum is exciting and diverse: you will have the opportunity to shape our youngsters into effective writers with the ability to convey their ideas in different styles and encourage them to be engaged, avid readers of a wealth of literature from the classics to contemporary authors.  \r\n\r\n\r\nWe are interested in recruiting teachers who are passionate about their subject and all aspects of English Language and Literature, ready to learn themselves and keep on developing their own subject knowledge alongside a team of expert practitioners. You will deliver a curriculum that prepares young people for their future success and become confident in communicating your passion to your students.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo be successful, you need to learn how to shape and develop your own teaching style through plenty of first-hand classroom experience, teaching all different types of learners across the Key Stages. You will be supported all the way through, observing experienced teachers and planning alongside them. You will be expected to be professional and organised, dedicated to staying up-to-date with the English curriculum. \r\n\r\n\r\nTrainees are also supported by a school Subject Based Mentor and a Link Tutor from Leeds SCITT. You will be expected to reflect on your progress in order to assess your own strengths and development potential, which should help you to grow in skill and confidence. You will not be the finished article but we hope this will be the beginning of a challenging and rewarding career, with sound foundations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you share this vision for young people, we want to meet you.","interviewProcess":"If you are invited to an interview, you will receive an email from us that explains everything you need to know about your interview. This includes the date, time and the location, as well as what to prepare beforehand and what will happen on the day, so it’s really important to read this email very carefully.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The first part of your training (the Lead School Experience) is based predominantly in the Lead School for your subject. This school has a specialism in your subject area and the Lead Tutors are subject experts who are also excellent teachers and trainers.\r\n\r\nEach school has dedicated training areas so that your training consists of quality time with your tutors.\r\n\r\nThe initial training is focused on subject pedagogy:\r\n\r\n•\tHow highly effective planning leads to successful outcomes in the classroom;\r\n\r\n•\tHow you can ensure pupils make good progress in their learning;\r\n\r\n•\tHow you can assess learning to inform next steps and strategies to support highly skilled personalisation.\r\n\r\nYou will be immersed in the school environment from week one and you will be seen as a professional by school staff, pupils and parents. This allows you to take the theory, thinking and research and implement this in the classroom, ensuring you develop your ‘teacher’ persona as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next stage of the course is called Stage A.  This is a full-time placement in a partnership school with some core development days at your Lead School and Leeds Trinity University.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring this stage you will have a dedicated Subject Mentor who will observe you teach, support you with your planning and developing your subject knowledge for teaching. They will be your first port of call during this stage of training when you establish yourself in the classroom as the teacher.\r\n\r\nThe third stage of the course Stage B is a full-time placement in a contrasting partnership school, again with some core development. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last two weeks of the training year, you will have the opportunity to undertake an enrichment and enhancement placement or experiences. What this looks like is entirely different for each trainee as this is a time to pursue an interest- such as working in a SEND school, an additional subject, organising out of school learning and many more options!\r\n","personalQualities":"What we see in successful applications and interviews\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople who:\r\n\r\n•\tHave a proactive and reflective approach to their own development\r\n\r\n•\tGenuinely desire to support young people and help them succeed\r\n\r\n•\tHave good interpersonal skills\r\n\r\n•\tAre friendly and engage with young people\r\n\r\n•\tHave a great love and enthusiasm for their subject\r\n\r\n•\tAre organised and can manage time and competing priorities\r\n\r\n•\tAre innovative and willing to try new ideas\r\n","otherRequirements":"Successful applicants also tend to have:\r\n\r\n*Advanced level qualifications (or equivalent) in English.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn offer of a place is subject to:\r\n\r\n* A satisfactory Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) Enhanced Disclosure Certificate \r\n* A satisfactory medical.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:50:48.373Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-29T12:30:01.409Z","cycle":"2023","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
