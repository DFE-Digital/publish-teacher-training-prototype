It is a very practical course with around two thirds of the time spent in schools, mostly working with teachers and pupils, and around one third spent on directed study, with partnership training in the University and school. It is an integrated academic and professional preparation for teaching, combining study at either postgraduate or professional level with practical training to meet the Teachers’ Standards.\r\n\r\nThe route gives you the ability to teach in both subjects and develop insights in the pedagogies required to be successful in these disciplines. While on teaching placement you will predominantly teach PE and will only be assessed against the Teachers' Standards in your PE lessons, but you will also teach your second subject. The strength behind this teaching route is that it offers a greater level of flexibility in your teaching employment and it gives schools something more than you just having the ability to teach PE.\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Interviews for PGCE programmes are currently being conducted via Microsoft Teams. The interview will consist of two tasks – one is related to the subject that you want to teach and the other is more generic written task. You will also have an interview with a member of the PGCE team.\r\n\r\nWhen your application has been received, the Admissions team will check that you meet the requirements for your chosen programme and will then invite you to book yourself onto an interview day that suits you.\r\n\r\nOnce you’ve booked your interview, you’ll receive all the information you need to fully prepare. This will include details of a short 5-minute teaching task that you’ll be asked to prepare. We’ll ask you about this as part of your subject interview.\r\n\r\nAfter your interview day, we’ll process your decision as quickly as possible and send you more information about meeting your conditions. \r\n\r\nIf you’ve applied for a School Direct place, we’ll also let the school know the outcome of the interview. For successful applicants, the School Direct partner will then make a decision as to whether to invite you to a second interview day in school.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"While studying this course, you will spend two-thirds of the year in placements in partner schools and other educational settings gaining rich and varied experiences designed to support meeting the standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).\r\n\r\nWorking with peers, tutors and school-based colleagues, you will develop your abilities to promote effective learning among 11-16-year-olds. You will also have opportunities to gain experience of the key stages before and after the ones in which you will qualify.","personalQualities":"","otherRequirements":"In addition to the requirements for entry to the Secondary PGCE Physical Education course, trainees on this pathway must also have achieved a standard equivalent to a C grade or above at A level or equivalent in the relevant EBacc subject (English, Maths, Science, History, Geography, Languages). You may also be asked to complete a Subject Knowledge Enhancement course as part of an offer.\r\n\r\n[Find out more on our website](https://www.bishopg.ac.uk/courses/pgcesecphyebacc/)\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:46:43.878Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-17T16:40:57.658Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
