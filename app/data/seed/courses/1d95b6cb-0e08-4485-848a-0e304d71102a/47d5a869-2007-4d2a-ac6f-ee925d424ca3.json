It is an integrated academic and professional preparation for teaching, combining study at either postgraduate or professional level with practical training to meet the Teachers’ Standards. \r\n\r\nThe aim of this course is that you should become a reflective practitioner – a teacher who thinks about their experiences and learns from them in order to improve their practice. \r\n\r\nDuring the course you will study two academic modules. The first of these, ‘Subject Knowledge and Pedagogy’, allows you to explore several different pedagogical approaches to a particular project that you are going to teach. A chosen pedagogy is justified, taught and then evaluated, clearly linking theory to practice. \r\n\r\nIn the ‘Classroom Focused Development’ module you will undertake a small research project in school having explored relevant research methods. \r\n\r\nYou will also have a focus on the professional learning needed to meet the Teachers’ Standards, including looking at planning, assessment and classroom management along with the underpinning theory.\r\n\r\nOur PGCE Social Science is aimed at trainees wishing to mainly teach the 14-19 curriculum in one or more of the social sciences in secondary schools and/or post-16 colleges. Y\r\n\r\nou will be given the opportunity to study and teach areas of the Social Sciences (Psychology, Sociology, Politics, Law, Health and Social Care, Citizenship, Criminology and PSHE) at Key Stages, 4 and 5. \r\n\r\nYou may gain some experience of teaching the humanities (RE, Geography and History) subjects at Key Stage 3 and 4. Social Science subjects are exceptionally popular choices at GCSE, A level, IB, BTEC and other vocational courses.\r\n\r\nYou will consider the broader aspects of teaching, contexts for learning, the latest government initiatives and contemporary issues in teaching, learning and assessment. You will also work alongside trainee teachers of other subjects to consider cross-curricular aspects of education. \r\n\r\nThroughout your year of study, you will explore all aspects of your subject. This includes those areas that are your strengths, as well as areas you may need to improve upon.\r\n\r\nYou will study how pupils learn in your subject area, how you need to assess them and how to keep abreast of new developments within your subject.\r\n\r\nYou will learn how to plan and deliver topics in ways that include all types of learners in meaningful ways.","interviewProcess":"Interviews for PGCE programmes are currently being conducted via Microsoft Teams. The interview will consist of two tasks – one is related to the subject that you want to teach and the other is more generic written task. You will also have an interview with a member of the PGCE team.\r\n\r\nWhen your application has been received, the Admissions team will check that you meet the requirements for your chosen programme and will then invite you to book yourself onto an interview day that suits you.\r\n\r\nOnce you’ve booked your interview, you’ll receive all the information you need to fully prepare. This will include details of a short 5-minute teaching task that you’ll be asked to prepare. We’ll ask you about this as part of your subject interview.\r\n\r\nAfter your interview day, we’ll process your decision as quickly as possible and send you more information about meeting your conditions. \r\n\r\nIf you’ve applied for a School Direct place, we’ll also let the school know the outcome of the interview. For successful applicants, the School Direct partner will then make a decision as to whether to invite you to a second interview day in school.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"While studying this course, you will spend two-thirds of the year in placements in partner schools and other educational settings gaining rich and varied experiences designed to support meeting the standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).\r\n\r\nWorking with peers, tutors and school-based colleagues, you will develop your abilities to promote effective learning among 11-16-year-olds. You will also have opportunities to gain experience of the key stages before and after the ones in which you will qualify.","personalQualities":"","otherRequirements":"[Find out more on our website](https://www.bishopg.ac.uk/course/pgcesecsoc/)","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:46:43.183Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-25T11:34:41.544Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
