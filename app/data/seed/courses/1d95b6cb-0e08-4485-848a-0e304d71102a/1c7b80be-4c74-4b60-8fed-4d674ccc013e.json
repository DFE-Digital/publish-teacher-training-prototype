It is an integrated academic and professional preparation for teaching, combining study at either postgraduate or professional level with practical training to meet the Teachers’ Standards.\r\n\r\nYou will consider the broader aspects of teaching, contexts for learning, the latest government initiatives and contemporary issues in teaching, learning and assessment. You will also work alongside trainee teachers of other subjects to consider cross-curricular aspects of education. These topics will introduce you to your career in the teaching profession.\r\n\r\nThroughout your year of study, you will explore all aspects of your subject. This includes those areas that are your strengths, as well as areas you may need to improve upon. \r\n\r\nYou will study how pupils learn in your subject area, how you need to assess them and how to keep abreast of new developments within your subject. You will learn how to plan and deliver topics in ways that include all types of learners in meaningful ways.\r\n\r\nYou will spend two-thirds of the year in partner schools and other educational settings gaining rich and varied experiences designed to support meeting the standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). Working with peers, tutors and school-based colleagues, you will develop your abilities to promote effective learning among 11-16-year-olds.\r\n\r\nYou will also have opportunities to gain experience of the key stages before and after the ones in which you will qualify.","interviewProcess":"Interviews for PGCE programmes are currently being conducted via Microsoft Teams. The interview will consist of two tasks – one is related to the subject that you want to teach and the other is more generic written task. You will also have an interview with a member of the PGCE team.\r\n\r\nWhen your application has been received, the Admissions team will check that you meet the requirements for your chosen programme and will then invite you to book yourself onto an interview day that suits you.\r\n\r\nOnce you’ve booked your interview, you’ll receive all the information you need to fully prepare. This will include details of a short 5-minute teaching task that you’ll be asked to prepare. We’ll ask you about this as part of your subject interview.\r\n\r\nAfter your interview day, we’ll process your decision as quickly as possible and send you more information about meeting your conditions. \r\n\r\nIf you’ve applied for a School Direct place, we’ll also let the school know the outcome of the interview. For successful applicants, the School Direct partner will then make a decision as to whether to invite you to a second interview day in school.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"While studying this course, you will spend two-thirds of the year in placements in partner schools and other educational settings gaining rich and varied experiences designed to support meeting the standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).\r\n\r\nWorking with peers, tutors and school-based colleagues, you will develop your abilities to promote effective learning among 11-16-year-olds.
