It is an integrated academic and professional preparation for teaching, combining study at either postgraduate or professional level with practical training to meet the Teachers’ Standards. \r\n\r\nThe Secondary Drama PGCE is taught by experienced staff with national and international profiles. Our subject specific sessions are usually taught through practical seminars and workshops and we focus on real challenges faced in the drama classroom by a secondary specialist teacher, including ‘active’ approaches to Shakespeare as a poet-playwright. \r\n\r\nTexts by this writer are a major element of the secondary school curriculum and the course benefits from a close working relationship with English PGCE colleagues, enabling expert input across both English and Drama. BGU has an excellent record of trainees finding employment as specialist drama teachers and our connection with English is a key element for future employability. \r\n\r\nWe provide access to a variety of school placement settings including Academies, comprehensive schools, state selective grammar schools, some rural, some urban, and where drama is taught as a discrete subject. The course includes enrichment visits to venues such as The Globe Theatre, and West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds as well as inputs from visiting professionals with expertise in theatre design and/or related specialisms. \r\n\r\nWe challenge and support trainees to develop their expertise as specialist drama educators of the future, to be the best they can be and to succeed in this rewarding career. Whilst the PGCE compliments BGU’s long established undergraduate degree pathways in Applied Drama, we welcome applications from well qualified drama graduates who have studied across the UK and beyond.\r\n\r\nYou will consider the broader aspects of teaching, contexts for learning, the latest government initiatives and contemporary issues in teaching, learning and assessment. You will also work alongside trainee teachers of other subjects to consider cross-curricular aspects of education. These topics will introduce you to your career in the teaching profession.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Interviews for PGCE programmes are currently being conducted via Microsoft Teams. The interview will consist of two tasks – one is related to the subject that you want to teach and the other is more generic written task. You will also have an interview with a member of the PGCE team.\r\n\r\nWhen your application has been received, the Admissions team will check that you meet the requirements for your chosen programme and will then invite you to book yourself onto an interview day that suits you.\r\n\r\nOnce you’ve booked your interview, you’ll receive all the information you need to fully prepare. This will include details of a short 5-minute teaching task that you’ll be asked to prepare. We’ll ask you about this as part of your subject interview.\r\n\r\nAfter your interview day, we’ll process your decision as quickly as possible and send you more information about meeting your conditions. \r\n\r\nIf you’ve applied for a School Direct place, we’ll also let the school know the outcome of the interview. For successful applicants, the School Direct partner will then make a decision as to whether to invite you to a second interview day in school.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"While studying this course, you will spend two-thirds of the year in placements in partner schools and other educational settings gaining rich and varied experiences designed to support meeting the standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).\r\n\r\nWorking with peers, tutors and school-based colleagues, you will develop your abilities to promote effective learning among 11-16-year-olds. You will also have opportunities to gain experience of the key stages before and after the ones in which you will qualify.","personalQualities":"","otherRequirements":"[Find out more on our website](https://www.bishopg.ac.uk/course/pgcesecdra/)","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:46:42.842Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-25T10:40:15.522Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
