It is a very practical course with around two-thirds of the time spent in schools, mostly working with teachers and pupils, and around one third spent on directed study, with partnership training in the University and school. \r\n\r\nThis full-time, one-year course or, up to two-year part-time course includes both school-based experiences and sessions at the university with a strong focus on integrating theory and practice. \r\n\r\nAt least 120 days will be based in schools. School placements are carefully structured to ensure the gradual development of your confidence as an effective teacher through building up experiences working with university-based mentors and school-based mentors.\r\n\r\nIt is an integrated academic and professional preparation for teaching, combining study at either postgraduate or professional level with practical training to meet the Teachers’ Standards. \r\n\r\nThe goal is that you should become a reflective practitioner – a teacher who thinks about their experiences and learns from them in order to improve their practice.\r\n\r\nThe focus of this course is on teaching and learning to support children and on the importance of your professional role. To this end you will be prepared to teach the relevant curriculum, focusing on both Foundation Stage and Key Stage 1.\r\n\r\nYou’ll carry out a series of school-based and directed study tasks which link the theory to practice and provide a focus for reflection.\r\n\r\nYou will be supported in your learning by university tutors, school teachers, school-based mentors and your peers. Practical teaching is introduced gradually, allowing you to build confidence and skills in a structured way.\r\n\r\nThe part-time route is particularly appropriate for graduate career changers or if you want to have a more gradual build-up in the amount of teaching that you do.\r\n\r\nYou will need extremely good time management skills, energy, a capacity for independent study and an ability to manage several tasks in parallel.\r\n\r\nThere is a strong emphasis on linking theory and practice and the academic modules support you in developing your practice.\r\n\r\nAll placements are part of the on-going assessment of the QTS standards and build up to longer placements. \r\n\r\nOn the full-time programme, this is in the second and third terms and on the part-time programme in the second year. There are opportunities for enrichment experiences to develop your breadth of experience in different schools.","interviewProcess":"Interviews for PGCE programmes are currently being conducted via Microsoft Teams. The interview will consist of two tasks – one is related to the subject that you want to teach and the other is more generic written task. You will also have an interview with a member of the PGCE team.\r\n\r\nWhen your application has been received, the Admissions team will check that you meet the requirements for your chosen programme and will then invite you to book yourself onto an interview day that suits you.\r\n\r\nOnce you’ve booked your interview, you’ll receive all the information you need to fully prepare. This will include details of a short 5-minute teaching task that you’ll be asked to prepare. We’ll ask you about this as part of your subject interview.\r\n\r\nAfter your interview day, we’ll process your decision as quickly as possible and send you more information about meeting your conditions. \r\n\r\nIf you’ve applied for a School Direct place, we’ll also let the school know the outcome of the interview. For successful applicants, the School Direct partner will then make a decision as to whether to invite you to a second interview day in school.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"While studying this course, you will spend two-thirds of the year in placements in partner schools and other educational settings gaining rich and varied experiences designed to support meeting the standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).\r\n\r\nWorking with peers, tutors and school-based colleagues, you will develop your abilities to promote effective learning among 11-16-year-olds. You will also have opportunities to gain experience of the key stages before and after the ones in which you will qualify.","personalQualities":"","otherRequirements":"[Find out more on our website](https://www.bishopg.ac.uk/course/pgceprim37/)","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:46:42.906Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-25T12:29:39.086Z","cycle":"2023","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
