Your school-based art mentor will provide ongoing developmental feedback, and help you to practically apply your thinking and learning about art and design pedagogy. \r\n\r\nYou will have access to BGU’s dedicated art facilities, including kilns for glass and ceramics, printing press, metalworking, ICT, and studio space. You will develop your own practice as an artist/designer during the year, both through continued attention to your own specialism and by expanding your skills and experiences through a range of workshops. ","interviewProcess":"Interviews for PGCE programmes are currently being conducted via Microsoft Teams. The interview will consist of two tasks – one is related to the subject that you want to teach and the other is more generic written task. You will also have an interview with a member of the PGCE team.\r\n\r\nWhen your application has been received, the Admissions team will check that you meet the requirements for your chosen programme and will then invite you to book yourself onto an interview day that suits you.\r\n\r\nOnce you’ve booked your interview, you’ll receive all the information you need to fully prepare. This will include details of a short 5-minute teaching task that you’ll be asked to prepare. We’ll ask you about this as part of your subject interview.\r\n\r\nAfter your interview day, we’ll process your decision as quickly as possible and send you more information about meeting your conditions. \r\n\r\nIf you’ve applied for a School Direct place, we’ll also let the school know the outcome of the interview. For successful applicants, the School Direct partner will then make a decision as to whether to invite you to a second interview day in school.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"While studying this course, you will spend two-thirds of the year in placements in partner schools and other educational settings gaining rich and varied experiences designed to support meeting the standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).\r\n\r\nWorking with peers, tutors and school-based colleagues, you will develop your abilities to promote effective learning among 11-16-year-olds. You will also have opportunities to gain experience of the key stages before and after the ones in which you will qualify.","personalQualities":"","otherRequirements":"Find out more on our website: https://www.bishopg.ac.uk/course/pgcesecart/","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:46:43.151Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-25T09:27:52.764Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
