As the curriculum changes, new approaches to teaching English emerge. You will learn more than just how to teach – you will be joining the conversation about the English curriculum and influencing the subject’s purpose and scope.\r\n\r\nUpon successful completion of your PGCE, you will graduate with Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and 90 Master’s credits.\r\n\r\n[Find out more about this course](https://www.uea.ac.uk/course/postgraduate/pgce-secondary-english)\r\n\r\n[Sign up for one of our information sessions](https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/school-of-education-and-lifelong-learning/initial-teacher-education/events-and-experience) \r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Interviews are part of the formal selection process.

On both routes, school experience takes place in partnership schools across the region. \r\n\r\nOn the School Direct route, you will already know the cluster of schools in which you might have one of your placements when you are offered a place on the course. This does not necessarily mean your placement will be with the lead school and we strongly encourage you to speak to the admissions team regarding the cluster of schools you are considering applying for, as there might be variations. \r\n\r\nDuring the two extensive placements in our partnership schools, you will gain a broad range of practical teaching experience. You will learn to put ideas and theory into practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"Trainees are selected on the basis of their application form, references and an interview. You are encouraged to prepare thoroughly.\r\nApplication forms should demonstrate strengths in subject and curriculum knowledge, your enthusiasm and commitment to a career in teaching, and the age range for which you have applied.\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"Prior to submitting your application, we recommend you gain some observational experience in a classroom environment if possible. This will help you gain an up-to-date understanding of how classrooms are managed and how teaching and learning takes place.\r\n\r\n\r\nApplicants must also obtain:\r\n* An Enhanced Criminal Records check from the [Disclosure and Barring Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service) \r\n* A satisfactory Health Check.
