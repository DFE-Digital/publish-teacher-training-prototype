Depending on bursaries and scholarships available, students may find the non-salaried route more financially attractive than a salaried position . \r\n\r\nPGCE top up.\r\n\r\nStudents can choose to top up their qualification to the PGCE; this is an additional £3290. The funding for this is usually paid for by the trainee unless the partner school offers to pay.\r\n","financialSupport":"Your eligibility for financial support, and the amount you can expect to receive, will depend on the subject you choose to teach and your degree classification or highest relevant academic qualification. Any applications for bursaries and Student Finance are the responsibility of the individual trainee.\r\n\r\n\r\n","aboutCourse":"Why School Direct?\r\n\r\nSchool Direct is a training programme for both graduates and career changers, where you can be fully immersed in the life of a teacher from day one. It gives the trainee the chance to work and learn alongside teachers within the full time setting of a school. It is a popular choice for those training to be a teacher who hope to secure a teaching post in the network of schools where they are training.\r\nSchool Direct courses within the DDS Partnership are designed in partnership with Canterbury Christ Church University based on the skills they are looking for in a newly qualified teacher. We are part of a growing number of schools leading the way for more school-led teacher training. This is really important to us because it means we can choose the very best talent and develop them into teachers. Being able to choose who we train as teachers helps us to deliver the best outcomes for the students.\r\n\r\nWhat will I learn?\r\n\r\nBy the end of your training course you will:\r\n- Set high standards which inspire, motivate and challenge pupils\r\n- Promote good progress and outcomes by pupils\r\n- Demonstrate good subject and curriculum knowledge\r\n- Plan and teach well-structured lessons\r\n- Adapt teaching to respond to the strengths and needs of all pupils\r\n- Make accurate and productive use of assessment\r\n- Manage behaviour effectively to ensure a good and safe learning environment\r\n\r\nThis course is offered as school direct non salaried (tuition fee)\r\n","interviewProcess":"Once you have applied, applicants will know as to whether they have been successful within 40 school days. If your initial application is of interest, you will have a formal interview at the Partner school that you have applied to. Each school will send you in advance the full details of their individual process. On that day you will be asked to undertake Literacy and Numeracy tests provided by Canterbury Christ Church University (different from the Skills Tests you have done/will do online). You will also be asked to lead part of a lesson - details of the observation year group (including SEN), the topic and focus will be provided in advance. The interview process is not designed to test your abilities to teach now, but on your potential to be trained on the programme.\r\nThe interview day is likely to include a tour of the school and meet with departmental staff to give you an idea of the environment you will be working in.\r\nIf you would like to visit any of the schools within the partnership prior to submitting an application, we would be happy to organize for you to come in and have a chat with us about the exciting teacher training opportunities available.\r\nWe can also provide you with support and guidance on your application form and offer you school experience if you just want a taster of what teaching could be like.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The key feature of this course is that the majority of the year is spent on placement working alongside experienced colleagues in schools. The course aims to harness the knowledge and experience of school colleagues in the delivery of courses, working in partnership with the experience of an accredited ITT provider. Each trainee is allocated a mentor who will support you over the course of the year. They will design a training programme based on your needs, ensuring that you have a broad and varied experience. Each trainee will also spend at least 20 days in a second school within the partnership in order to gain experience of a different setting.","personalQualities":"A great teacher is one a student remembers and cherishes forever; teachers have long-lasting impacts on the lives of their students. As a partnership we have successfully trained teachers from a wide range of backgrounds, all with different experiences prior to making the decision to teach. Whatever your background you will need to be patient and caring with a love of your subject. A willingness to dedicate yourself to the success and well-being of the students is essential.\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"The DDS Partnership is committed to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children. Applicants must be willing to undergo child protection screening, including an enhanced disclosure check.\r\nFor further information on what becoming a teacher might involve more generally, you can also visit\r\n[www.education.gov.uk/get-into-teaching]\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:54:39.959Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-27T08:51:15.059Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2024"}
