Company for a Tuition Fee Loan and means tested maintenance loan.\r\n\r\nDPSCITT has a small means tested bursary for trainees on the programme who experience financial difficulties during the year.  Please contact us if you wish to know more.\r\n\r\nWe are a non-profit making organisation.  Your money therefore is spent entirely on providing you with outstanding training. \r\n\r\n","aboutCourse":"DPSCITT offers a 1 year Primary PGCE Programme with Qualified Teacher Status, which is carefully structured, through central and school-based training, to maximise learning. Our PGCE is validated by the University of Plymouth.\r\n\r\nOur couse is constantly updated with Headteachers and School-based Tutors to ensure that it is ‘Inspirational, creative, innovative and transformational’ (Ofsted, 2016)\r\n\r\nRelationships are key, and our ‘class-sized’ cohort brings a broad range of experiences, while everyone feels known and valued. Trainees are supported extremely well by school and centre-based staff, with a focus on personal wellbeing. Also, our friendly and approachable Personal Tutors are available at the centre and in school for 1:1 discussions, and provide support via phone and e-mail at the point of need.\r\n\r\n“Strong professional relationships lie at the heart of the high-quality training offered by the SCITT…Their expert skills in training teachers have been honed through years of collaborative practice and rigorous self-evaluation.” (Ofsted, 2016)\r\n\r\nPersonalised and cohesive, the course emphasises learning through dialogue and reflection on experience, linked to educational theory. Through interactive training and individual coaching, trainees are supported to develop their own teaching philosophies and identities. School-based tasks contextualise and extend the learning gained from each centre-based training session. \r\n\r\nCentre-Based Training forms 25% of the course and is provided by exceptional national and local consultants, specialists and serving practitioners who are passionate about their subjects. Trainers inspire and encourage creative and dynamic approaches to the curriculum and to professional practice. Training sessions are multi-layered, with theoretical subject knowledge applied within smaller group activities, and excellent teaching and assessment practice is modelled explicitly.  \r\n\r\nSchool-based Training forms 75% of the course and is carefully planned to build confidence in teaching, develop understanding, and experience the wider role of a teacher. Specific tasks, linked to the centre-based training, include focused observations, reading, and teaching opportunities within your ‘home class’, and across the school. With daily and weekly support from your Class Teacher and School-based Tutor, these build towards blocked Teaching Practices each term. \r\n\r\nMasters Credits are awarded for 2 of the 3 written Assignments, which enable you to relate theory to practice in SEND, Maths and Phonics. A further practical Assignment allows you to design and teach a creative, cross-curricular teaching sequence.\r\n\r\nSEND Specialism\r\nWhile all trainees benefit from extensive training in SEND, those considering teaching within Specialist provision have the opportunity to complete their Spring term placement in a Special School. \r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Up to six candidates are invited to each interview day. Each of these take place at a different Partnership School with the DPSCITT Director and Headteachers. \r\n\r\nInterview days are informal and enjoyable, providing a range of opportunities for each candidate to demonstrate their skills and attributes. They are also designed to provide meaningful insights into the course itself to enable you to make an informed choice.\r\n\r\nCandidates will be invited to:\r\n\r\n*   Lead a short teaching session with 6 children (prepared in advance).\r\n*   Write a brief evaluation of the teaching session\r\n*   Complete short Literacy and Maths papers\r\n*   Collaborate in a discussion-based group task.\r\n*   Participate in an informal interview.\r\n\r\nDuring the day there will be plenty of opportunities to ask questions and gain a good understanding of our course.  You will also be able to meet current and former trainees over lunch to find out about it from their perspectives.\r\n\r\nAll candidates are offered detailed feedback following the interview, and individual Course Preparation Plans are provided for successful candidates to ensure that their support can be effectively tailored from the outset.\r\n\r\n“Fab interview process…very open and friendly”\r\n\r\n“It was amazing to be part of the day in a school setting”\r\n\r\n“I really enjoyed the day and feel more confident in my choice of career\" \r\n\r\n                                                                 (DPSCITT Interview Candidates)\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"\r\nAll our Partnership Schools have been selected for their commitment to developing children and adults, within an ethos of openness and collaboration. \r\n\r\nWe have a wide range of Partnership Schools across Devon, Plymouth and Torbay, and are committed to organising both your placements in schools close to your home. If you have a preferred Key Stage, we ensure that you start the course in this, such that two of your three terms are spent within this Key Stage. Also, as we know our schools and their staff well, we are able to consider your individual requirements, strengths and personalities when arranging placements.\r\n\r\nIn each of your placements, you will receive:\r\n\r\n*  The regular support of your School-based Tutor and your Class Teacher\r\n*  Weekly Seminar Meetings to discuss, monitor and guide your training \r\n*  Opportunities to observe and work alongside excellent practitioners \r\n*  Professional guidance from key staff across the school\r\n*  Opportunities to be involved in the wider life of the school community\r\n\r\nYou are welcomed into your ‘home’ school on the first day of term, where you spend the Autumn and Summer Terms. In the Spring you transfer to your second placement, which will be in the alternative Key Stage and can, if you wish, be in a Special school.\r\n\r\nYour School-based Tutor meets with you each week to support, coordinate and personalise your training, drawing on the expertise of all school staff.\r\n\r\nPrior to your second placement, your first School-based Tutor meets with your next one to draft a personal action plan for you, ensuring a smooth transition. Before Easter, both your School-based Tutors meet together with you to prepare your Summer term action plan to ensure continuity and maximise your learning.\r\n\r\nOpportunities to observe and participate in the wider life of your placement schools, through staff and parent’s meetings, and other school events, mean you are fully prepared for your first teaching post.\r\n\r\n“This course has given me more than I ever felt it could.
