The recruitment and selection of students is undertaken by schools. Potential students are interviewed by the lead  school and if successful, this may become their main placement school, where they will spend the larger part of their teaching experience, or they may be offered a place in another school in the alliance. \r\nSchools work in alliances, with a Lead School taking responsibility for the co-ordination of the School Direct programme across the alliance. \r\nThe Lead School organises teaching experience days for students on key aspects of teaching and learning such as planning, assessment and meeting individual needs. They also have responsibility for preparing students to teach the Foundation Subjects and RE.\r\nIn addition to work in school, students will attend 20 days at the lead school for additional input and will have some time between lectures for study and reflection. There is an expectation that students attend a SMSC day conference, ‘Living and Learning in Diverse 21st Century Britain’.  SMSC explores important themes and dimensions; these go across subjects and are central to the delivery of a broad and balanced curriculum and the wider professional responsibilities of teachers.\r\nStudents will complete four assessments over the year, each contribute 15 M level credits towards a PGCE, all are led and marked by University tutors. Student must pass all assignments and their Teaching Experience (TE) to achieve qualified teacher status (QTS). On completion of the programme, successful students will gain 60 credits at Masters level, which they may use towards a future continuing professional development qualification, they will be awarded a PGCE and be recommended for Qualified Teacher Status. PGCE certificates are graded as pass, merit or distinction according to the grades obtained from each of the assessed units.","interviewProcess":"When shortlisted for interview candidates will be invited to the Lead School - All Souls' CE in Heywood for an interview.
