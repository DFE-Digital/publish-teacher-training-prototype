The course leads to Qualified Teacher Status (QTS), with the option to complete a Masters Level Post Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) with the University of Hull. \r\n\r\nYou will be fully integrated into the subject department at your host school where you will learn from an experienced mentor and other host teachers.   You will receive training in how to teach across the 11-16 age range, including techniques for managing classroom behaviour and ensuring pupils of all abilities and needs can learn and make good progress.   You will also have opportunities to observe post-16 lessons and get involved in a range of extra-curricular trips and activities. \r\n \r\nAs this is a salaried training route, you will be expected to teach a regular timetable of about 12-13 hours per week.  Some of these lessons will be supported by host teachers who can observe and give you feedback and set targets to help you improve further.  Other lessons you will teach on your own and then hold follow-up discussions your mentor to reflect on the progress those classes are making.   This approach helps to build your confidence within a manageable timetable so that, by the end of the course, you are able to make a smooth transition to the NQT timetable expected in your first teaching year.     \r\n\r\nEach week you will receive high quality one-to-one mentoring from a subject specialist as well as core Professional Studies training delivered by Specialist leaders in Education (SLEs).  There are also regular Subject Knowledge and Pedagogy (SKAP) training sessions, and university-led tuition to support your PGCE assignments.   \r\n\r\nAs well as your two main placements, we also arrange visits for you to spend time in a Primary school, Special School and Free School as part of your programme to enable you to gain further experience of the education sector.    \r\n\r\nYou are assessed at half termly review points throughout the course by your mentor in conjunction with a Link Tutor.  These assessments are based on reviewing the progress of the classes you have been teaching as well as your ‘evidence bundle’ of lesson plans, resources and observations etc which is kept electronically on a SharePoint Cloud system.   At each review point, personalised targets will be set to help you progress further towards meeting the Teacher Standards to the highest possible standard.  \r\n","interviewProcess":"All short-listed candidates will have a formal interview with a panel that consists of representatives from the School Direct partnership. The interview panel will seek to gauge your potential, motivation and suitability for the teacher training programme, and will ask about any relevant experience, subject/curriculum knowledge, as well as your understanding about education and the role of the teacher.  \r\n\r\nCandidates are also expected to deliver a mini lesson to some KS3 students as part of the interview.  Further details about this will be included in the interview invitation letter.\r\n\r\nAll candidates are also required to take a short literacy test as part of the interview process.   \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will spend the full academic year in your host school, with a second placement in a contrasting secondary school.
