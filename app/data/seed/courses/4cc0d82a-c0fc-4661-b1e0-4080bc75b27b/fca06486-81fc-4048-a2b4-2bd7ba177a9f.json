Our trainees spend four days per week in school supported by the best mentors and host teachers. Mentors and host teachers support trainees as they develop these skills in the classroom, conducting weekly mentor meetings in which trainees set their own enquiry questions. Weekly enquiry planning sessions give trainees time to utilise the resources and staff expertise available.\r\nSubject immersion days support the development of subject specific pedagogy, with taught sessions focusing on specific aspects of teaching. Trainees can see the techniques discussed in practice, with experienced expert teachers demonstrating these aspects within their lessons, as well as supporting experiential learning opportunities like visiting the local Buddhist centre and mosque. All trainees are assigned a Yorkshire Wolds tutor and these sessions celebrate progress and support trainees overcome the challenges they may face. There are six review points during the training year with the final assessment taking place in the summer term.\r\nReligious Education is a multi-disciplinary course focusing on the development of subject knowledge to teach a variety of beliefs including non-religious worldviews. Trainees will learn about the ‘new’ locally agreed syllabus for RE and the unique disciplinary lenses underpinning a more knowledge rich RE curriculum making it an even more relevant and academic subject for the modern world. Trainees will have unlimited access to the latest subject specific pedagogies and latest evidence informed research from NATRE, RE Today and the latest RE publications. Training and support will be given to be able to produce high quality lesson resources incorporating the six key principles of making every RE lesson count. At KS4, trainees will experience not only teaching two world religions but also delivering ethical and moral issues through topics such as crime, peace and conflict, Issues of life and death and Relationships. The demand for good specialist Religious Educations has never been greater and it has never been a better time to join us to start your RS journey. It is a subject that supports the development of students and their perspectives through its deep discussions and getting students to reflect on moral decisions. If you like leading discussions, delivering exciting topics and working with a variety of worldviews then this subject is for you.\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"The Director of Yorkshire Wolds Teacher Training and the appropriate Yorkshire Wolds Subject Lead conduct interviews often with a subject mentor from one of our partnership schools. The process will be approximately half a day, giving you the opportunity to meet some students and members of the YWTT team who will answer any questions you might have.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Yorkshire Wolds Teacher Training works in partnership with a range of schools across the East Riding of Yorkshire and Hull. Trainees are given the opportunity to place possible placement schools in order of preference, with all of the 2018-19 cohort of trainees being given their first preference school for one of their placements. Trainees have ten secondary and ten primary schools from which to make their preferences. \r\n\r\nThe programme is designed to help trainees develop a deep understanding of the similarities and differences between schools having placements in three different schools; the initial orientation placement which occurs in the second week of the course, followed by a diversity and main placement which are longer in length. The course also includes diversity days at other educational institutions, allowing trainees to broaden their knowledge of the whole education system.  All secondary trainees have the opportunity to experience the 16-18 phase on one of their placements.","personalQualities":"In your application and throughout the selection process, we are looking for people with a genuine passion and enthusiasm for teaching and their subject.
