Their programmes are recognised by Ofsted as “outstanding” in every criterion across Primary and Secondary Education.\r\n\r\nSchool Direct (Tuition Fee) is a route into teaching at both primary and secondary levels. Trainees join other student teachers on the established Music PGCE programme at the UCL Institute of Education (IOE), whilst undertaking their teaching experience at a host school with the Agnus Dei Teaching School Alliance.\r\n\r\nThe Music PGCE introduces students to the broad scope of Music as a curriculum subject across the 11-16 age range. The course is designed to support musicians in coming to an understanding of what it means to be an effective and successful music educator.  Our priority is to develop your expertise in a variety of teaching situations, by exploring a range of different teaching styles. We will offer a range of perspectives on the principles of syllabus design, evaluation and assessment.  We aim to deepen students' theoretical understanding of educational issues through engaging practical music workshops, lectures, seminars and tutorials.\r\n\r\nStudents undertake two Master’s-level (level 7) modules of 30 credits each, totaling 60 credits. These can be carried forward onto full Master’s programmes at the IOE.\r\n\r\nThe Secondary PGCE consists of three core modules: two Master’s-level (level 7) modules, which are assessed through written assignments and practical musicianship tasks, and the Professional Practice module, which is assessed by the observation of practical teaching in placement schools.\r\n\r\nCompletion of the Professional Practice module and the two level 7 (Master’s level) modules (60 credits) will result in the award of a Postgraduate Certificate of Education (PGCE). Completion of the Professional Practice module and one or two level 6 (undergraduate/Bachelor’s level) modules, will lead to the Professional Graduate Certificate of Education (PgCE).\r\n\r\nFor more information about the School Direct Music course please see: (http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/courses/teacher-training/music-school-direct-pgce)","interviewProcess":"Students are advised to apply as early as possible due to competition for places.
