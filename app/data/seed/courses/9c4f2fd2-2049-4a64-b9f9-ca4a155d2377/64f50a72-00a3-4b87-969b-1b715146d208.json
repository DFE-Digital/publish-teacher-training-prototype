Their programmes are recognised by Ofsted as “outstanding” in every criterion across Primary and Secondary Education.\r\n\r\nSchool Direct (Tuition Fee) is a route into teaching at both primary and secondary levels. Trainees join other student teachers on the established Geography PGCE programme at the UCL Institute of Education (IOE), whilst undertaking their teaching experience at their host school within the Agnus Dei Teaching School Alliance.\r\n\r\nThis programme consists of university-based sessions, school-based sessions and teaching placements. The university-based sessions will include the study of the geography curriculum, lesson planning, effective teaching, classroom management and approaches to assessment.\r\n\r\nThe university based element of the course is closely linked to the school based elements of the course and some of the professional studies elements will be delivered in school. There are a small number of lectures but most university-based work is undertaken in a subject specialist group of 20-25 students.\r\n\r\nStudents undertake two Master’s-level (level 7) modules of 30 credits each, totaling 60 credits. These can be carried forward onto full Master’s programmes at the IOE.\r\n\r\nThe Secondary PGCE consists of three core modules: two Master’s-level modules, which are assessed through written assignments, and the Professional Practice module, which is assessed by the observation of practical teaching in placement schools.\r\n\r\nCompletion of the Professional Practice module and the two level 7 (Master’s level) modules (60 credits) will result in the award of a Postgraduate Certificate of Education (PGCE). Completion of the Professional Practice module and one or two level 6 (undergraduate/Bachelor’s level) modules, will lead to the Professional Graduate Certificate of Education (PgCE).\r\n\r\nFor more information about the School Direct Geography course please see: (http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/courses/teacher-training/geography-school-direct-pgce)","interviewProcess":"Students are advised to apply as early as possible due to competition for places. Those applying for scholarship funding (particularly overseas applicants) should take note of application deadlines.\r\n\r\nInitial Interviews are carried out by UCL in conjunction with St. Bonaventure's School.\r\n\r\nIf you are successful at the school interview you will be invited to a second-stage interview at UCL Institute of Education. At your interview day you will take part in a combination of group and individual interviews with members of the programme team, and you may also be asked to undertake written or presentation tasks, depending on your subject.
