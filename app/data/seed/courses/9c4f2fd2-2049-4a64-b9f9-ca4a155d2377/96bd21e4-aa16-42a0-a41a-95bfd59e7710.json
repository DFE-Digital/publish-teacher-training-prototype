Their programmes are recognised by Ofsted as “outstanding” in every criterion across Primary and Secondary Education.\r\n\r\nSchool Direct (Tuition Fee) is a route into teaching at both primary and secondary levels. Trainees join other student teachers on the established Languages PGCE programme at the UCL Institute of Education (IOE), whilst undertaking their teaching experience at a host school with the Agnus Dei Teaching School Alliance.\r\n\r\nThis programme enables students to engage critically with a number of approaches and issues relating to languages education, such as the teaching of grammar, the incorporation of literature into lessons, target language use and the monitoring and assessment of pupils' learning. It incorporates a range of approaches to effective, inclusive learning, and develops a student’s professionalism and critical awareness to a high level. Wherever possible, we provide opportunities for trainees to gain experience at Key Stage 5 (post-16 age range).\r\n\r\nStudents undertake two Master’s-level (level 7) modules of 30 credits each, totaling 60 credits. These can be carried forward onto full Master’s programmes at the IOE.\r\n\r\nThe Secondary PGCE consists of three core modules: two Master’s-level modules, which are assessed through written assignments, and the Professional Practice module, which is assessed by the observation of practical teaching in placement schools.\r\n\r\nCompletion of the Professional Practice module and the two level 7 (Master’s level) modules (60 credits) will result in the award of a Postgraduate Certificate of Education (PGCE). Completion of the Professional Practice module and one or two level 6 (undergraduate/Bachelor’s level) modules, will lead to the Professional Graduate Certificate of Education (PgCE).\r\n\r\nYou will spend most of your time (120 days) in schools, working with subject specialist mentors who support you through your school placements.\r\n\r\nThe programme is delivered via keynote lectures, subject lectures, seminars, workshops, tutorials and directed study days at the IOE, as well as time spent in placement at the host school or alliance. Assessment is by the observation of practical teaching, assignments and a portfolio (which links into continuing professional development in the induction year).\r\n\r\nFor more information please see: (https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/teacher-training-programmes/modern-foreign-languages-school-direct-pgce) ","interviewProcess":"Students are advised to apply as early as possible due to competition for places. Those applying for scholarship funding (particularly overseas applicants) should take note of application deadlines.\r\n\r\nInitial Interviews are carried out by UCL in conjunction with St. Bonaventure's School.\r\n\r\nIf you are successful at the school interview you will be invited to a second-stage interview at UCL Institute of Education. At your interview day you will take part in a combination of group and individual interviews with members of the programme team, and you may also be asked to undertake written or presentation tasks, depending on your subject. You will have the opportunity to ask questions and take a self-guided campus tour. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/teacher-training-programmes/modern-foreign-languages-school-direct-pgce)\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Students spend most of their time (120 days) in schools, working with Languages mentors who support them through school placements.
