The course sets out to give you a sense of the place of history in a multicultural society. It also equips you to teach across secondary and to foster learning across the wide spectrum of abilities found in local schools. You will enter into the lively debates surrounding history teaching and the place of history in the whole school curriculum, including history’s contribution to literacy and citizenship.\r\n\r\nThe course is an active and demanding combination of teaching and learning methods, including simulations of classroom activities, individual tutorials and group sessions. You are encouraged to share your own expertise and experience. We take advantage of developments in e learning to stay in touch during placements, to encourage collaborative and creative teaching, and to promote reflective and effective practice. Written assignments give you the opportunity to explore the most recent developments in research into teaching and learning, while building upon your grounding in history at undergraduate or masters level.\r\n\r\nEntry requirements\r\nApplicants should have an approved degree in history or in a closely related subject that has a large percentage of history content (at least 50%). Early application is advisable, and interviews will be offered to candidates who have spent some time observing or working in a school. Interviews will include written and practical tasks related to the National Curriculum at Key Stage 3 in History. It is expected that places will be offered to candidates with a 2:1 or above.\r\n\r\nFor more information about the School Direct History Course please see: (https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/postgraduate-courses/pgce-secondary/pgce-secondary-history-specialism/)","interviewProcess":"Applicants will be interviewed in conjunction with St. Bonaventure's School. Observation before interview is not a requirement. Many applicants do find observation before interview can be very helpful, however. \r\nCandidates should note that school placements will be in local state secondary schools, so observational experience outside of this sector might not provide an adequate understanding of the rewards and challenges presented to teachers in this sector. Any observational experience – in either the state or independent sector – should provide an opportunity to gain insight into teaching, learning and reflection upon the professional responsibilities of teachers. Candidates are invited to contact subject tutors for advice by email if they have any uncertainties about the relevance of observation undertaken.\r\n\r\nFor more information please see: (https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/applying/pgce-secondary-entry-requirements/)","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will spend at least 120 days in school over the year long programme, and will also attend classes at Roehampton. Your main placement will be in a school within the Agnus Dei Teaching School Alliance and there will also be a shorter placement in another school within the alliance which will add breadth to the experience.\r\n\r\nYou will be visited in school by a university tutor, and you will have a mentor in school. The training at Roehampton will enable you to reflect upon your practice within the broad context of educational theory so that you will feel equipped to teach in any school.\r\n\r\nFor more information please see: (https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/postgraduate-courses/school-direct/)","personalQualities":"We are looking for applicants who have the potential to become outstanding teachers, and who are able to work independently on their studies while training in a school context. \r\nA successful applicant will be highly self-motivated, hardworking and deeply reflective. In addition, applicants should be willing and ready to take on advice and feedback, adapt their teaching to suit different learning styles and work successfully in a professional whole-school environment.","otherRequirements":"We recommend that you undertake some relevant work experience prior to interview.
