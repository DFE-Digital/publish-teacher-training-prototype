The programme is taught by tutors who have considerable experience in the secondary school sector as well as in managing PGCE students. Valuable input into the course is made by teachers from schools where students are placed for classroom experience. \r\n\r\nBy the end of the programme you will have learnt how to develop and extend your pupils' language competence in all its forms, how to organise, structure and assess work for a range of abilities and ages, how to meet the needs of individual learners and how to implement strategies promoting equal opportunities. You will learn about current developments in the teaching of English and its place as a core subject in the National Curriculum. This includes a close look at three key areas: ICT, media and drama. A resource centre has been established at Roehampton so that you will have access to a wide range of texts and materials to support your teaching. \r\n\r\nEntry requirements\r\nApplicants should have a single subject degree in English or a joint degree in which English forms the major part. It is essential that all applicants have substantial study of literature as part of their educational background. Interviews will include a discussion of suitable texts for an A-level course. It is expected that places will be offered to candidates with a 2.1 or above.\r\n\r\nFor more information about the School Direct English Course at the University of Roehampton please see: (https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/postgraduate-courses/pgce-secondary/pgce-secondary-english-specialism/)\r\n","interviewProcess":"Applicants will be interviewed in conjunction with St. Bonaventure's School. Observation before interview is not a requirement. Many applicants do find observation before interview can be very helpful, however. \r\nCandidates should note that school placements will be in local state secondary schools, so observational experience outside of this sector might not provide an adequate understanding of the rewards and challenges presented to teachers in this sector. Any observational experience – in either the state or independent sector – should provide an opportunity to gain insight into teaching, learning and reflection upon the professional responsibilities of teachers. Candidates are invited to contact subject tutors for advice by email if they have any uncertainties about the relevance of observation undertaken.\r\n\r\nFor more information please see: (https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/applying/pgce-secondary-entry-requirements/)","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will spend at least 120 days in school over the year long programme, and will also attend classes at Roehampton. Your main placement will be in a school within the Agnus Dei Teaching School Alliance and there will also be a shorter placement in another school within the alliance which will add breadth to the experience.\r\n\r\nYou will be visited in school by a university tutor, and you will have a mentor in school. The training at Roehampton will enable you to reflect upon your practice within the broad context of educational theory so that you will feel equipped to teach in any school.\r\n\r\nFor more information please see: (https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/postgraduate-courses/school-direct/)","personalQualities":"We are looking for applicants who have the potential to become outstanding teachers, and who are able to work independently on their studies while training in a school context. \r\nA successful applicant will be highly self-motivated, hardworking and deeply reflective. In addition, applicants should be willing and ready to take on advice and feedback, adapt their teaching to suit different learning styles and work successfully in a professional whole-school environment.","otherRequirements":"We recommend that you undertake some relevant work experience prior to interview.
