Their programmes are recognised by Ofsted as “outstanding” in every criterion across Primary and Secondary Education.\r\n\r\nSchool Direct (Tuition Fee) is a route into teaching at both primary and secondary levels. Trainees join other student teachers on the established English PGCE programme at the UCL Institute of Education (IOE), whilst undertaking their teaching experience at their host school within the Agnus Dei Teaching School Alliance.\r\n\r\nYou will develop an understanding of classroom practice and the theories underpinning teaching and learning in English, media and drama. Tasks set throughout the year will enable you to reflect on your own as well as children’s learning and development. Most of our schools offer opportunities to work with pupils who have English as an additional language or special educational needs.\r\n\r\nStudents undertake two Master’s-level (level 7) modules of 30 credits each, totaling 60 credits. These can be carried forward onto full Master’s programmes at the IOE.\r\n\r\nThe Secondary PGCE consists of three core modules: two Master’s-level modules, which are assessed through written assignments, and the Professional Practice module, which is assessed by the observation of practical teaching in placement schools.\r\n\r\nCompletion of the Professional Practice module and the two level 7 (Master’s level) modules (60 credits) will result in the award of a Postgraduate Certificate of Education (PGCE). Completion of the Professional Practice module and one or two level 6 (undergraduate/Bachelor’s level) modules, will lead to the Professional Graduate Certificate of Education (PgCE).\r\n\r\nFor more information about the School Direct English Course please see:\r\n(https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/teacher-training-programmes/english-school-direct-pgce)","interviewProcess":"Students are advised to apply as early as possible due to competition for places. Those applying for scholarship funding (particularly overseas applicants) should take note of application deadlines.\r\n\r\nInitial Interviews are carried out by UCL in conjunction with St. Bonaventure's School.\r\n\r\nIf you are successful at the school interview you will be invited to a second-stage interview at UCL Institute of Education. At your interview day you will take part in a combination of group and individual interviews with members of the programme team, and you may also be asked to undertake written or presentation tasks, depending on your subject. You will have the opportunity to ask questions and take a self-guided campus tour. \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will spend two-thirds of your time (120 days) in schools, working with English mentors who support you through your two school placements. We are fortunate to have an excellent choice of schools within our alliance, with some outstanding mentors and strong English departments. The Professional Practice module is assessed through these placements, associated tasks and a portfolio.\r\n\r\n(https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/teacher-training-programmes/english-school-direct-pgce)","personalQualities":"We are looking for applicants who have the potential to become outstanding teachers, and who are able to work independently on their studies while training in a school context. \r\nA successful applicant will be highly self-motivated, hardworking and deeply reflective.
