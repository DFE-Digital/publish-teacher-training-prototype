Their programmes are recognised by Ofsted as “outstanding” in every criterion across Primary and Secondary Education.\r\n\r\nSchool Direct (Tuition Fee) is a route into teaching at both primary and secondary levels. Trainees join other student teachers on the established Art and Design PGCE programme at the UCL Institute of Education (IOE), whilst undertaking their teaching experience at our host school within the Agnus Dei Teaching School Alliance.\r\n\r\nProgramme Information\r\nThis programme aims to inform and inspire, to challenge orthodoxies and encourage a freshness of vision. It provides support and guidance for learning and teaching in art and design, identifying strategies to motivate and engage pupils in making, discussing and evaluating visual and material culture.\r\n\r\nThrough seminars and studio-based activities, students will study the concepts, processes and skills of art, craft and design, sharing their knowledge and understanding with other student teachers and considering how it relates to the secondary curriculum. Towards the end of the PGCE, students will build on their own practice by initiating a curriculum development project, culminating in the display of their work at a final exhibition that represents their personal philosophy for art and design education.\r\n\r\nStudents undertake two Master’s-level (level 7) modules of 30 credits each, totalling 60 credits. These can be carried forward onto full Master’s programmes at the IOE.\r\n\r\nThe Secondary PGCE consists of three core modules: two Master’s-level modules, which are assessed through written assignments, and the Professional Practice module, which is assessed by the observation of practical teaching in placement schools.\r\n\r\nCompletion of the Professional Practice module and the two level 7 (Master’s level) modules (60 credits) will result in the award of a Postgraduate Certificate of Education (PGCE). Completion of the Professional Practice module and one or two level 6 (undergraduate/Bachelor’s level) modules, will lead to the Professional Graduate Certificate of Education (PgCE).\r\n\r\nFor more information about the Schools Direct Tuition Fee Route for Art and Design please see:\r\n(http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/courses/teacher-training/art-design-school-direct-pgce)\r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Students are advised to apply as early as possible due to competition for places.
