The programme provides opportunities for students to explore the theory and practice of Music education through a range of lectures, workshops and tutorials, and to develop their expertise in the classroom through two school placements.\r\n\r\nThe course will provide students with an awareness of the theoretical foundations of the subject, of strategies for teaching and learning in Music and of current issues surrounding Music education. Workshops will enable students to explore a range of practical processes and approaches. Regular tutorials enable students to receive individual support from tutors. Tutors on the programme are experienced teachers of Music.\r\n\r\nDuring school placements, students benefit from working alongside experienced teachers of Music. Students have opportunities to observe excellent teaching before experimenting with approaches to teaching and learning across the secondary age range, during which time they are supervised and supported by teachers and tutors.\r\n\r\nApplicants should have a degree that includes a substantial element of Music. At interview candidates will be expected to provide and talk through their creative work and to discuss their reflections on teaching and learning in Music that they have experienced recently in schools. \r\n\r\nFor more information about the School Direct Music course please see: (https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/postgraduate-courses/pgce-secondary/pgce-secondary-music-specialism/)","interviewProcess":"Applicants will be interviewed in conjunction with St. Bonaventure's School. Observation before interview is not a requirement. Many applicants do find observation before interview can be very helpful, however. \r\nCandidates should note that school placements will be in local state secondary schools, so observational experience outside of this sector might not provide an adequate understanding of the rewards and challenges presented to teachers in this sector. Any observational experience – in either the state or independent sector – should provide an opportunity to gain insight into teaching, learning and reflection upon the professional responsibilities of teachers. Candidates are invited to contact subject tutors for advice by email if they have any uncertainties about the relevance of observation undertaken.\r\n\r\nFor more information please see: (https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/applying/pgce-secondary-entry-requirements/)","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will spend at least 120 days in school over the year long programme, and will also attend classes at Roehampton. Your main placement will be in a school within the Agnus Dei Teaching School Alliance and there will also be a shorter placement in another school within the alliance which will add breadth to the experience.\r\n\r\nYou will be visited in school by a university tutor, and you will have a mentor in school. The training at Roehampton will enable you to reflect upon your practice within the broad context of educational theory so that you will feel equipped to teach in any school.\r\n\r\nFor more information please see: (https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/postgraduate-courses/school-direct/)","personalQualities":"We are looking for applicants who have the potential to become outstanding teachers, and who are able to work independently on their studies while training in a school context. \r\nA successful applicant will be highly self-motivated, hardworking and deeply reflective. In addition, applicants should be willing and ready to take on advice and feedback, adapt their teaching to suit different learning styles and work successfully in a professional whole-school environment.","otherRequirements":"We recommend that you undertake some relevant work experience prior to interview.
