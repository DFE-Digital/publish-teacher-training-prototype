Their programmes are recognised by Ofsted as “outstanding” in every criterion across Primary and Secondary Education.\r\n\r\nSchool Direct (Tuition Fee) is a route into teaching at both primary and secondary levels. Trainees join other student teachers on the established Business Studies PGCE programme at the UCL Institute of Education (IOE), whilst undertaking their teaching experience at their host school within the Agnus Dei Teaching School Alliance. \r\n\r\nStudents will understand how business is taught in schools, how pupils learn and make sense of the evolving nature of business. This is reflected in the range of business related courses that are now offered by schools, sixth forms and colleges, with the focus in some instances on entrepreneurship, work skills and new business technologies.\r\n\r\nStudents will be joining the largest Business PGCE programme in the country, allowing them to benefit from a team of tutors with a wide range of expertise of business, both inside and outside of the classroom. Students will also be able to develop strong peer networks, share ideas, resources and advice amongst your cohort of fellow PGCE Business students.\r\n\r\nStudents undertake two Master’s-level (level 7) modules of 30 credits each, totaling 60 credits. These can be carried forward onto full Master’s programmes at the IOE.\r\n\r\nThe Secondary PGCE consists of three core modules: two Master’s-level modules, which are assessed through written assignments, and the Professional Practice module, which is assessed by the observation of practical teaching in placement schools.\r\n\r\nCompletion of the Professional Practice module and the two level 7 (Master’s level) modules (60 credits) will result in the award of a Postgraduate Certificate of Education (PGCE). Completion of the Professional Practice module and one or two level 6 (undergraduate/Bachelor’s level) modules, will lead to the Professional Graduate Certificate of Education (PgCE).\r\n\r\nFor more information about the School Direct Business Studies Course please see: (https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/teacher-training-programmes/business-studies-school-direct-pgce)\r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Students are advised to apply as early as possible due to competition for places. Those applying for scholarship funding (particularly overseas applicants) should take note of application deadlines.\r\n\r\nInitial Interviews are carried out by UCL in conjunction with St. Bonaventure's School.\r\n\r\nIf you are successful at the school interview you will be invited to a second-stage interview at UCL Institute of Education.
