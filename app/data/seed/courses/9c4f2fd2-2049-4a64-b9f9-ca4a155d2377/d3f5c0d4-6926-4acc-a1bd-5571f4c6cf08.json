The course covers all aspects of mathematics teaching and learning, with an emphasis on practical activities for use in school.\r\n\r\nThere is a strong emphasis on using problem solving and real life scenarios, as well as planning for the whole ability range to ensure that all pupils are able to make progress.\r\n\r\nOur experienced mathematics tutors work in close partnership with trainees, link tutors and the placement schools.\r\n\r\nFor more information about the School Direct Mathematics course please see: (https://www.stmarys.ac.uk/postgraduate-courses-london/pgce-secondary-maths/)\r\n","interviewProcess":"On the day you will take part in a brief tour of the campus and an informative lecture about the course and our expectations.\r\n\r\nYou will also be asked to undertake some short written tasks to show your capability in written English, spelling and grammar. You won't need to prepare for this in advance.\r\n\r\nIn addition, you'll be assigned a small group with other candidates and asked to prepare a short presentation about a current educational topic. Each group will in turn present their ideas and engage in discussion.\r\n\r\nThere will also be a personal interview overseen by one or more members of the PGCE team. \r\n\r\nYour performance will be assessed by several people - including senior staff from our partner schools - any decisions about acceptance are only made when all assessments are collated and discussed by the course team panel. At St Mary's, we would like all applicants to have made a fully informed decision about considering joining the teaching profession. As part of that decision making process, spending some time in school(s) observing what teachers do and beginning to give some consideration to how they manage learning can be really insightful and informative.\r\n\r\nYour training is most likely to take place in mixed, state comprehensive school environments. If you are choosing to complete some school observation as part of making an informed decision about teaching then we would encourage you to do so in a similar school setting.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"During your studies you'll be allocated two school placements within the Agnus Dei Teaching School Alliance, which will add breadth to your teaching experience.
