The University is at the forefront of computing education, with staff contributing to curriculum development, publications and policy at national and international level. \r\n\r\nStudents learn about the challenges and opportunities of teaching computing, IT and digital literacy in secondary schools. The course looks at how approaches from the world of software development, such as agility and craftsmanship have parallels in the classroom, and can be applied to teaching and learning in programming and digital media. The course equips you to develop your students' computational thinking and ICT capability, within and beyond the subject curriculum. \r\n\r\nTeaching and learning methods provide both challenge and support, and draw on practical activities, independent study, group work and academic input; high quality school placements are an integral part of the course. Written assignments allow you to pursue your own professional interests from a foundation of core pedagogic subject knowledge. \r\n\r\nThe course is ideally suited to recent graduates in computing related degrees and to those with practical experience of software development. The University hopes to offer a preliminary subject knowledge enhancement course for graduates in other subjects without programming experience. A small number of competitive scholarships of £27,500 tax free are available from the BCS for computing trainees, for more information click here. Tax Free bursaries of up to £20,000 are available dependent on your degree classification. \r\n\r\nEntry requirements\r\n\r\nThe department welcomes graduates from a range of backgrounds such as those with digital making skills, industry experience, practical experience of software development or a degree in computer science. The University hopes to offer a preliminary subject knowledge enhancement course for graduates in other subjects without programming experience.\r\n\r\nFor more information about the School Direct Computing Course please see: (https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/postgraduate-courses/pgce-secondary/pgce-secondary-computing-specialism/)","interviewProcess":"Applicants will be interviewed in conjunction with St. Bonaventure's School. Observation before interview is not a requirement. Many applicants do find observation before interview can be very helpful, however. \r\nCandidates should note that school placements will be in local state secondary schools, so observational experience outside of this sector might not provide an adequate understanding of the rewards and challenges presented to teachers in this sector. Any observational experience – in either the state or independent sector – should provide an opportunity to gain insight into teaching, learning and reflection upon the professional responsibilities of teachers. Candidates are invited to contact subject tutors for advice by email if they have any uncertainties about the relevance of observation undertaken.\r\n\r\nFor more information please see: (https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/applying/pgce-secondary-entry-requirements/)","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will spend at least 120 days in school over the year long programme, and will also attend classes at Roehampton. Your main placement will be in a school within the Agnus Dei Teaching School Alliance and there will also be a shorter placement in another school within the alliance which will add breadth to the experience.\r\n\r\nYou will be visited in school by a university tutor, and you will have a mentor in school. The training at Roehampton will enable you to reflect upon your practice within the broad context of educational theory so that you will feel equipped to teach in any school.\r\n\r\nFor more information please see: (https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/postgraduate-courses/school-direct/)","personalQualities":"We are looking for applicants who have the potential to become outstanding teachers, and who are able to work independently on their studies while training in a school context. \r\nA successful applicant will be highly self-motivated, hardworking and deeply reflective. In addition, applicants should be willing and ready to take on advice and feedback, adapt their teaching to suit different learning styles and work successfully in a professional whole-school environment.","otherRequirements":"We recommend that you undertake some relevant work experience prior to interview.
