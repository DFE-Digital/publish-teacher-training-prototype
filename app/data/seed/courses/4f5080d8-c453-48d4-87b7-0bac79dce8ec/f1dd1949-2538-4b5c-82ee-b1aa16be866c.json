However, trainees have two contrasting placements so you will receive a 6-7 week contrasting placement in the Spring term to allow to teach in a different school and year group.

Working in a close geographical area, our trainee teachers typically travel only a few miles from home to school.\r\n\r\nFrom day one, you will be regarded as a teacher. As an employed, salaried trainee, you will have greater responsibility for lead teaching your class than a non-salaried trainee. The amount you are lead teaching depends upon your experience and will be agreed with the employing school at interview. Salaried trainee teachers may lead teach up to 3 days per week from September. All trainee teachers (salaried and non-salaried) teach 16 hours per week by the end of the course.\r\n","personalQualities":"Applicants for our courses come from a diverse range of backgrounds and have a variety of prior experiences.
