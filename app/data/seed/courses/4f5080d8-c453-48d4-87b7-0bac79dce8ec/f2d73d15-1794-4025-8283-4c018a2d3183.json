In addition, you will receive a personalised programme of additional visits to specialist schools, developing skills specific to your needs. This enables you to experience a range of educational approaches, preparing you to work with the unique, dynamic and diverse communities Milton Keynes has to offer.\r\n\r\nOur primary trainees teach across the 5-11 age range. You will spend four days per week in school and one day per week training with the Tommy Flowers SCITT. We work with 40 partner schools across Milton Keynes and the surrounding area who share the same values, curriculum approach, high standards and commitment to partnership as us. Working in a close geographical area, our trainee teachers typically travel only a few miles from home to school.\r\n\r\nFrom day one, you will be regarded as a teacher. However, your teaching timetable will develop and grow to suit your own experience, pace and progress. Initially, you will observe teachers across your school so that you become familiar with the children and approach to teaching in your school. Gradually, you will build up your teaching so that you are lead teaching up to 4-8 lessons a week before October half term. The proportion of lead teaching would then increase gradually each week until your timetable reaches approximately 16 hours per week.\r\n","personalQualities":"Applicants for our courses come from a diverse range of backgrounds and have a variety of prior experiences. Many applicants are recent or soon-to-be graduates from university, whilst others have been working in schools already, perhaps as teaching assistants, volunteers or office staff.
