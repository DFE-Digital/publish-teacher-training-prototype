Graduates applying for initial teacher training (ITT) usually take out a student loan to pay their £9250 tuition fees to Exceed SCITT.  Although there’s a cost, applicants need to consider the starting salary of a teacher is £25,000 and there are many options to secure promotion within a few years of qualifying. The pain of paying a loan is compensated by a good starting salary and a rewarding career. \r\n\r\nTrainees need to consider how they transport themselves from their training school to the training venues across the Leeds Partnership. Some of our trainee teachers often car share, reducing travel costs. Having said this, please remember that our schools are geographically close to each other. \r\n\r\nFor more information about fees and funding please visit Student Finance.\r\nhttps://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/funding-and-salary/overview\r\n\r\n","financialSupport":"At Exceed SCITT we want to ensure that all trainees with potential to become a teacher can access teacher training programmes. \r\n\r\n​Planning to train to be a teacher and choosing the right route into teaching for you is an exciting moment in your life.

","aboutCourse":"Our unique school direct programme maximises your time in school and in classrooms. You'll be awarded Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) by Exceed SCITT and a Post Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) by a University. Even the PGCE is drawn directly from your work in school and is not a separate taught course. \r\n\r\nA strength of this course is the way in which theory and practice are related as a result of extensive time spent working with children in at least two schools. Throughout the programme, you will develop an understanding of the theories that underpin good practice, observe good and outstanding teaching and reflect and evaluate your impact on pupil progress. \r\n\r\nThis course is targeted at teaching pupils aged between 3 and 7 (Foundation Stage and KS1). The programme is organised into three stages which gradually take you from the beginnings of planning and teaching to being  a competent and confident, professional, reflective practitioner. Our unique programme focuses on the National Curriculum so that each trainee develops strong subject knowledge and teaching strategies to ensure pupil progress. Another key strand of the programme is Professional Practice, such as effective behaviour management and understanding inclusion. We also recognise that each trainee is an individual and we will ensure that the programme is bespoke to meet individual needs as personal well-being is also very important to us. \r\n\r\nEach candidate will be allocated a class based mentor. You will work with the mentor, receiving weekly tutorials to celebrate successes and work on areas for development. Your mentor will work with you to jointly agree your targets and next steps for development as a teacher. \r\n\r\nEvery aspect of the programme is led by practitioners/tutors working in our partnership schools. All of our practitioners/tutors have proven expertise in their subject and professional knowledge. We encourage a reflective approach to your learning so there is time to discuss, model  and work with other trainees to share best practice you have observed. \r\n\r\nIf you're wanting to train to be a teacher and make a difference to children's life chances, there is no better place to train than in our partnership schools. Leeds is a fantastic place to train to teach and our schools will provide you with a wealth of experience for starting your teaching career.
