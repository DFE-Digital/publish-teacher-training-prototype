Graduates applying for initial teacher training (ITT) usually take out a student loan to pay their £9250 tuition fees to Exceed SCITT. Some trainees may be eligible for a government bursary as an incentive to train to be a teacher, but the government seem to reduce these each year or increase their expectations about the class of honours degree you need to have secured before you start teacher training. Although there’s a cost, applicants need to consider the starting salary of a teacher is £25,000 and there are many options to secure promotion within a few years of qualifying. The pain of paying a loan is compensated by a good starting salary and a rewarding career. \r\n\r\nFor more information about fees and funding please visit Student Finance.\r\n(https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/funding-and-salary/overview)\r\n\r\n","financialSupport":"At Exceed SCITT we want to ensure that all trainees with potential to become a teacher can access teacher training programmes. \r\n\r\n​Planning to train to be a teacher and choosing the right route into teaching for you is an exciting moment in your life. Getting the right financial advice and support is a crucial step in the decision-making process.\r\n\r\nStaff within the partnership can offer help, support and guidance on funding the tuition fees, applying for a student loan and managing your money throughout the duration of the programme.  ","aboutCourse":"Our unique school direct programme maximises your time in school and in classrooms. The PGCE is drawn directly from your work in school and provides an opportunity for you to reflect on the progress made by the pupils. A strength of this course is the way in which theory and practice are related as a result of extensive time spent working with children in at least two schools. Throughout the programme, you will develop an understanding of the theories that underpin good practice, observe good and outstanding teaching and reflect and evaluate your impact on pupil progress. \r\n\r\nThe programme is organised into three stages which gradually take you from the beginnings of planning and teaching to being  a competent and confident, professional, reflective practitioner. Our programme focuses on the National Curriculum so that each trainee develops strong subject knowledge and teaching strategies to ensure pupil progress. Another key strand of the programme is Professional Practice, such as effective behaviour management and understanding inclusion. We also recognise that each trainee is an individual and we will ensure that the programme is bespoke to meet individual needs as personal well-being is also very important to us. \r\n\r\nEvery aspect of the programme is led by practitioners/tutors working in our partnership schools. All of our practitioners/tutors have proven expertise in their subject and professional knowledge. We encourage a reflective approach to your learning so there is time to discuss, model  and work with other trainees to share best practice you have observed. \r\n\r\nFor the award of QTS you will be assessed continuously throughout your school assessed blocks in order to show progress through the school year. The PGCE (60 Masters Level Credits) is supported by a Tutor from Leeds Trinity University and whilst you can access all the support services, resources and learning hub that a HEI can offer, your qualification is drawn directly from your work in school. There are only two PGCE assignments, carefully designed to be accessible and impact on the quality of your teaching and the children's learning in your classroom. The University tutor supports you by coming to the Leeds Hub of Exceed SCITT and offering seminars and small group tutorials.
