In addition to the training for the course, you would be expected to have additional responsibilities and accountability in the school, which tuition fee trainees wouldn't have. \r\n\r\nYou would then undertake a 6 week placement in the Spring Term in a contrasting school, in a different Key Stage.  \r\n\r\nSalaried positions are only available in certain placement schools, so please contact us to enquire about the Salaried vacancies we have and your suitability for these posts. \r\n\r\nThe course itself is structured around six modules - a combination of taught modules based at the University and placement modules based in schools or educational settings.\r\n\r\nYou will undertake studies in all elements of primary education; extend your knowledge of learning and teaching, of the breadth and scope of the curriculum and the professional skills associated with high-quality teaching. You will then apply these areas of understanding and skill to classroom practice throughout the year, including during two assessed placements in schools or educational settings.\r\n\r\nUpon successful completion of the course you will be awarded a PGCE with recommendations for the award of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). \r\n\r\nThe age range of the course in 5 - 11. \r\n\r\nAnyone already in education will tell you that teaching is one of the toughest jobs out there. It's also one of the most rewarding. To make sure youâ€™re a successful and confident teacher in the 21st-century, we have devised a vibrant programme informed by research and constantly reviewed to ensure students are equipped with the most up-to-date developments in primary education.\r\n\r\nOur passion is to provide you with a university experience that immerses you in the theory and practice of teaching. You will love studying at our beautiful campus where your lecturers know you by name, helping you to develop the confidence you need to be an outstanding teacher and make a real difference in the world.\r\n","interviewProcess":"If you already meet or are expected to meet our entry requirements, and have demonstrated your passion and commitment to teaching in your application, you will be invited to attend an interview. \r\n\r\nThe interview is your chance to demonstrate your potential to become a successful teacher. The interview day consists of a written task, a lesson to a class and an individual interview. \r\nFurther information about the format of the day will be sent to you via email in advance of the interview date. \r\n\r\nThe interview is also your chance to find out more about the University, the course and the schools that we use for placements. ","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Teaching placements are located  in Bournemouth and Poole, within schools that are part of the Ambitions Training School Alliance. \r\n\r\nTrainees stay in one school for the majority of the year apart from when they have a 6 week long placement in a contrasting school in the Spring Term. \r\nAs a salaried trainee, you would have additional responsibilities in your main placement school. \r\n\r\nYou will complete placements in both Key Stage 1 (ages 5-7) and Key Stage 2 (ages 7-11). We aim to ensure your main placement is in your preferred Key Stage and that the 6 week placement is in the contrasting Key Stage, in a different school. \r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"We will look for evidence of a commitment to the teaching profession, an understanding of professional requirements, and an awareness of current educational issues in an application. Prior experience in a school is not required, however prospective students may find experience in a school useful for obtaining insights into the secondary education classroom.
