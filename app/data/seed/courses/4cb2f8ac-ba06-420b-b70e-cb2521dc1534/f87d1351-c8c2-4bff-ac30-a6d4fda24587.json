You will then apply these areas of understanding and skill to classroom practice throughout the year, including during two assessed placements in schools or educational settings.\r\n\r\nUpon successful completion of the course you will be awarded a PGCE with recommendations for the award of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).\r\n\r\nAnyone already in education will tell you that teaching is one of the toughest jobs out there. It's also one of the most rewarding. To make sure you’re a successful and confident teacher in the 21st-century, we have devised a vibrant programme informed by research and constantly reviewed to ensure students are equipped with the most up-to-date developments in primary education.\r\n\r\nOur passion is to provide you with a university experience that immerses you in the theory and practice of teaching.

The interview day consists of a written task, short  lesson (30mins) to a group of pupils and individual interview. \r\nFurther information about the format of the day will be sent to you via email in advance of the interview date. \r\n\r\nThe interview is also your chance to find out more about the University, the course and the schools that we use for placements. ","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Teaching placements are located  in Bournemouth and Poole, within schools that are part of the Ambitions Training School Alliance. \r\n\r\nTrainees stay in one school for the majority of the year apart from when they have a 6 week long placement in a contrasting school in the Spring Term. \r\n\r\nYou will complete placements in both Key Stage 1 (ages 5-7) and Key Stage 2 (ages 7-11). We aim to ensure your main placement is in your preferred Key Stage and that the 6 week placement is in the contrasting Key Stage, in a different school.\r\n\r\nWhen we call you for an interview, we will discuss whether you have any preferences for placements schools as the interview is usually undertaken at the school where your main placement will be. ","personalQualities":"We will look for evidence of a commitment to the teaching profession, an understanding of professional requirements, and an awareness of current educational issues in an application. Prior experience in a school is not required, however prospective students may find experience in a school useful for obtaining insights into the secondary education classroom. Experience in a school or similar setting may also provide reassurance to prospective students that teaching is the right choice for their career.","otherRequirements":"If you accept an offer of a place you will be required to complete a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) criminal records check and Prohibition Order check. If you have spent time overseas in the last 5 years you may also be required to obtain criminal records checks from each of the countries you visited.
