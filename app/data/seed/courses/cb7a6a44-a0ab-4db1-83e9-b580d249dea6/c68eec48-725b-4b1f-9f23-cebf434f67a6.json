You will also have the opportunity to broaden your specialist subject knowledge by teaching Physical, Human and Environmental Geography - we will support you with this! \r\n\r\nYou will deliver exciting lessons that discuss the natural processes that affect millions of people every year like volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and tsunamis, how climate change is affecting populations and how population change is itself affecting different countries. \r\n\r\nYour classroom will be brimming with opportunities for students to explore the world through images, film clips, stories of personal experiences and of course, maps! \r\n\r\nOn completion of this programme, you will be awarded a PGCE with QTS and 90 Masters credits in Education from Durham University.\r\n\r\nYou'll be delighted to know that we have a strong partnership with Durham University who are one of the leading departments for education in the UK as they regularly feature in the top five in national university league tables such as 3rd in the Guardian University Guide 2019.
