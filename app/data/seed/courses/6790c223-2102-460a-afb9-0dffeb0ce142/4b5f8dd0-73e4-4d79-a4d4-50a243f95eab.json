NTU is an established and successful provider of initial teacher-training and education-related courses. Staff at our school work with the experienced researchers and practitioners at the University to design and deliver our courses which can be tailored to meet your individual needs. These courses carefully blend significant hands-on teaching experience in our schools with the critical thinking and theoretical underpinning that is so important for the teaching profession. The University offers a Postgraduate Certificate in Education, which can be obtained alongside the recommendation for Qualified Teacher Status. National surveys show that NTU’s trainee teachers highly recommend their course, and over 9 out of 10 are employed in a teaching role in the year following graduation – well above the national average. Many go on to progress successfully into leadership roles.

Each student will also have a 2nd placement school within the partnership.  This 2nd placement will take place after Christmas, whereupon the student will work in the opposite Key Stage to the one in their main school.\r\nThe candidate usually spends 4 days per week in school and 1 day at NTU.
