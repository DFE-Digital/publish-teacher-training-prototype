Our aim is to ensure you are able to deliver the wide-ranging curriculum covered under English, including Language, Literature and supporting studies in Drama and Media education.\r\n\r\nYou’ll learn the teaching methods and strategies that will help your classes develop their reading, writing, speaking and listening skills so they become effective communicators.\r\n\r\nYou’ll explore, test and develop the links between English in education theory and its practice. University workshops and seminars facilitate a space for learners to conduct this, which is then supported by your school placements.\r\n\r\nThis relationship, between theory and practice, alongside a variety of contrasting school experiences, ensures that you are offered a well-rounded teacher education. We believe that we are training English teachers to work in any school setting. Your course will feature a range of modules and the opportunity to get plenty of hands-on practice in local schools with support from colleagues in the school partnership and experienced University tutors.\r\n\r\nAll aspects of the PGCE including your school experience will be assessed through our Core ITE Curriculum.\r\n\r\n[More information about this course is available on our website.]\r\n(https://www.bcu.ac.uk/education-and-social-work/courses/pgce-secondary-english-2022-23)","interviewProcess":"You will be required to attend one online interview via Microsoft Teams.
