For example, if you have a degree in Health and Social Care you’ll fit into Science and Technology, or with a degree in Construction you might fit into Science or Mathematics.\r\n\r\nIf you’re unsure how your degree fits into one of the categories, please contact the course director, Stuart Mitchell via email on Stuart.Mitchell@bcu.ac.uk who will be able to help guide you.\r\n\r\nYou’ll study a wide range of modules alongside completing at least 150 hours of teaching in your main subject area.
