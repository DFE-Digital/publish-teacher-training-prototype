You’ll encourage pupils in their ability to problem solve using a variety of powerful modelling techniques. Your impact will be far-reaching, ensuring your pupils become creators of technology and not just consumers. You will help them develop transferable skills that can be used in a range of subject areas.\r\n\r\nThis course benefits from strong links with the British Computer Society (BCS) who are working with the Department for Education to develop the next generation of computing teachers through an organisation called\r\nComputing at School. The opportunities this partnership provides allows you to network with expert computing teachers throughout the West Midlands at regular hub meetings and access subject development opportunities.\r\n\r\nYou’ll explore, test and develop the links between computing in education theory and its practice. The practical workshops in University facilitate a means for learners to conduct this, which is then supported\r\nby school placements.\r\n\r\nThis relationship, between theory and practice, alongside a variety of contrasting school experiences, ensures that you are offered a well-rounded teacher education. We believe that we are training computing teachers to work in any school setting. Your course will feature a range of modules and the opportunity to get plenty of hands-on practice in\r\nlocal schools with support from colleagues in the school partnership and experienced University tutors.\r\n\r\nTwo thirds of your course will take place in schools with the other third in a university setting.\r\n\r\nAll aspects of the PGCE, including your school experience placement of 120 days, will be linked closely to the BCU Core Curriculum Framework.\r\n\r\n[Find out more about this course on our website.]\r\n(https://www.bcu.ac.uk/education-and-social-work/courses/pgce-secondary-computer-science-it-2022-23)","interviewProcess":"You will be required to attend one  online interview via Microsoft Teams. Interviews include:\r\n* exploration of curriculum knowledge\r\n\r\n* discussions about relevant experiences\r\n\r\n* a presentation or small teaching exercise \r\n\r\n* written task\r\n\r\nWe also look for: \r\n* good communication skills\r\n\r\n* potential / suitability to be a good teacher\r\n\r\n* robustness to cope with the demands of the course","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will spend two-thirds of your time – at least 120 days – working in schools on block placements gaining valuable real-life experience in schools. The 120 days will be split over a minimum of two placements . You will gain direct teaching experience and work with experienced practitioners in the classroom. School placements are predominantly in West Midlands secondary schools. You will be assigned a trained mentor and/or a tutor while on placement, who will support and guide your work, as well as provide training and feedback.","personalQualities":"","otherRequirements":"Applicants must meet the Department for Education’s Initial Teacher Training criteria, which means being medically fit, successfully completing an enhanced disclosure via the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) and satisfying any other safeguarding checks required by this course.\r\n\r\nWhile not essential, you may wish to gain some school experience before attending interview.\r\n\r\nIf you are a graduate and wish to train as a teacher but your degree did not provide enough subject specific content for you to gain automatic entry, you may be required to complete a Subject Knowledge Enhancement (SKE) course.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:52:49.980Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-13T12:15:42.146Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
