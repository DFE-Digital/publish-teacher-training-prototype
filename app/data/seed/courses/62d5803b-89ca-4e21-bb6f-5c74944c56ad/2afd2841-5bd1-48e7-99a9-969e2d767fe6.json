While on the course you would have school based training in Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2. \r\n\r\nYour school based training will include schools recognised for their strengths in SEN or in special schools, allowing you to immerse yourself in this specialist area. School based training will also include mainstream schools thus giving you a breadth of experience and enhancing your employability in the future. \r\n\r\nAs part of the Professional studies and leadership module you will choose SEN as your area of leadership to explore at a deeper level.\r\nYou will learn to teach across the whole range of subjects in the primary National Curriculum, with a strong focus on core subjects.\r\nThe course is taught by experienced practitioners, all of whom have been exceptional teachers and senior managers within schools.\r\n\r\nAll aspects of the PGCE, including your school experience placement of 120 days, will be linked closely to the BCU Core Curriculum Framework.\r\n\r\n[Find out more on our website]\r\n(https://www.bcu.ac.uk/courses/pgce-primary-education-specialism-sen-2022-23)\r\n","interviewProcess":"You will be required to attend one on line interview.
