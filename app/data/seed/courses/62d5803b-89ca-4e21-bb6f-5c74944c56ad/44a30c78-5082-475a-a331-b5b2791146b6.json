You will be taught two days across the first and second years. This will leave you with the rest of the week to study, attend placement and attend to any other commitments you might have.\r\n\r\nThe school-based training days do not have a fixed number of days each week but will be agreed flexibly between the placement school(s), us (the University) and you as the trainee teacher. You will need to complete 120 days in school with a fairly equal split across the two years. While the majority of your time on placement will be on part-time basis (to be agreed individually), each year of the course you will need to spend at least two weeks in your placement school on a full-time basis (at least 10 days each year). \r\n\r\nUndertaking this course in the West Midlands also provides you with the opportunities to understand the urban context and experience working with children from a wide range of social, economic and cultural backgrounds. \r\n\r\nWhile the PGCE is an academic qualification, the emphasis is very much on practical experience, with around two thirds of the course spent in school. You will learn by attending workshops, group discussions, as well as blended learning. However this course is practical and very hands-on in its approach to the training of teachers.\r\n\r\nAll trainees will learn to teach across the whole range of subjects in the primary National Curriculum, with a strong focus on English and mathematics. This will be linked closely to the BCU Core Curriculum Framework.\r\n\r\nWithin the professional studies and leadership module you will be able to focus on a National curriculum subject with a view to subject leadership in the future. \r\n\r\n[Find out more on our website]\r\n(https://www.bcu.ac.uk/courses/pgce-primary-and-early-years-education-2022-23)","interviewProcess":"You will be required to attend one on line interview.
