This will be linked closely to the BCU Core Curriculum Framework.\r\n\r\nWhile the PGCE is an academic qualification, the emphasis is very much on practical experience, with around two thirds (120 days) of the course spent in school. While on the course you would have school based training in Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2.\r\n\r\nSchool based training will include schools recognised for their strengths in mathematics, allowing you to immerse yourself in this specialist area. In addition, you will choose mathematics as your area of leadership to explore at a deeper level when you are completing academic work for your Professional Studies and Leadership module with a view to you leading the subject in the future. \r\n\r\nYou will learn to teach across the whole range of subjects in the primary National Curriculum, with a strong focus on core subjects.\r\nThe course is taught by experienced practitioners, all of whom have been exceptional teachers and senior managers within schools.\r\n\r\nAll aspects of the PGCE, including your school experience placement of 120 days, will be linked closely to the BCU Core Curriculum Framework.\r\n\r\n[Find out more on our website]\r\n(https://www.bcu.ac.uk/courses/pgce-primary-education-specialism-mathematics-2022-23)\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Interview process\r\n\r\nYou will be required to attend one on line interview.
