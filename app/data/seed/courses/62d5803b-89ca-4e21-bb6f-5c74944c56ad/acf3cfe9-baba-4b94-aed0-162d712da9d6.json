We’ll train you to teach across the years, covering topics from learning how to introduce students to atoms, elements and particles, to thermodynamics and inorganic chemistry. \r\n\r\nYou’ll also learn how to demonstrate impressive chemical reactions safely!\r\n\r\nAs you progress, you’ll increase your ability to handle the ever-evolving teaching environment, and by the time your course is complete, you’ll be in a position to continue developing your understanding, knowledge and skills throughout your professional life.\r\n\r\nYour course will feature a range of modules and the opportunity to get plenty of hands-on practice in local schools with support from colleagues in the school partnership and experienced University tutors. So while the PGCE is an academic qualification, the emphasis is very much on practical experience, with around two thirds of the course spent in school.\r\n\r\nThe course is taught by experienced practitioners, all of whom have been exceptional teachers and senior managers within schools.\r\n\r\nAll aspects of the PGCE, including your school experience placement of 120 days, will be linked closely to the BCU Core Curriculum Framework.\r\n\r\n[Find out more about this course on our website.]\r\n(https://www.bcu.ac.uk/education-and-social-work/courses/pgce-secondary-science-chemistry-2022-23)","interviewProcess":"You will be required to attend one online interview via Microsoft Teams.

The 120 days will be split over a minimum of two placements in science departments. You will gain direct teaching experience and work with experienced practitioners in the classroom. School placements are predominantly in West Midlands secondary schools. You will be assigned a trained mentor and/or a tutor while on placement, who will support and guide your work, as well as provide training and feedback.","personalQualities":"","otherRequirements":"Applicants must meet the Department for Education’s Initial Teacher Training criteria, which means being medically fit and successfully completing an enhanced disclosure via the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) and satisfying any other safeguarding checks required for this course.\r\n\r\nWhile not essential, you may wish to gain some school experience before attending interview.\r\n\r\nIf you are a graduate and wish to train as a teacher but your degree did not provide enough subject specific content for you to gain automatic entry, you may be required to complete a Subject Knowledge Enhancement (SKE) course.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:52:49.546Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-13T12:10:32.547Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
