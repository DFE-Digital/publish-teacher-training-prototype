You’ll benefit from our strong partnerships with organisations and colleges outside of the University as well as workshops and the superb support offered by tutors and mentors.\r\n\r\nYou can train to teach any subject that is taught at post-compulsory level. To do this we match your degree subject (in any subject area) to one of the PCET specialisms that we offer:\r\n\r\n* Arts, Media and Performance\r\n\r\n* English, Literacy and English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL)\r\n\r\n* Humanities and Social Sciences\r\n\r\n* Mathematics and Numeracy\r\n\r\n* Science and Technology\r\n\r\nThe means you could have a degree in any subject to apply for this course and we will place you in one of the umbrella categories above. For example, if you have a degree in Health and Social Care you’ll fit into Science and Technology, or with a degree in Construction you might fit into Science or Mathematics.\r\n\r\nIf you’re unsure how your degree fits into one of the categories, please contact the course director, Stuart Mitchell via email on Stuart.Mitchell@bcu.ac.uk who will be able to help guide you.\r\n\r\nYou’ll study a wide range of modules alongside completing at least 150 hours of teaching in your main subject area. Your coursework, assignments and teaching practice will continually be assessed as you progress through the programme.\r\n\r\n[Further details about this course are available on our website]\r\n(https://www.bcu.ac.uk/courses/pgce-post-compulsory-education-training-2022-23)\r\n","interviewProcess":"You will be required to attend one online interview via Microsoft Teams.
