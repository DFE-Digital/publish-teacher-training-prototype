The course is designed to ease trainees into gradually taking on the full responsibilities of a class teacher, including a sizeable teaching workload by Easter. Training in school is supported and enhanced by academic study and independent research. \r\n\r\nTrainees will spend four and a half days in school carrying out a range of professional activities, including observing other teachers, team-teaching and solo-teaching. The remaining half day a week will be for professional development through weekly training sessions, facilitated by [Teach Kent and Sussex](https://www.teachkentandsussex.org.uk/about-teach-kent-sussex/) based at Bennett Memorial Diocesan School, Tunbridge Wells. [Click here](https://www.teachkentandsussex.org.uk/centre-based-training/) for more information.\r\n\r\nTeach Kent and Sussex was recently rated OUTSTANDING in all areas by Ofsted. [Click here](https://files.ofsted.gov.uk/v1/file/50135014) to read the full inspection report. Regarding the professional development programme, Ofsted reported that:\r\n \r\n\"The course provides trainees with an outstanding grounding in recent, highly credible research into teaching, learning and the curriculum. From the outset, trainees learn about how pupils gain and remember new knowledge. They develop a secure understanding of how curriculum content can be selected and sequenced to ensure that pupils master key concepts.\"\r\n\r\nTrainees will be fully supported throughout the year by an assigned mentor, an experienced teacher who will themselves be trained and supported by Teach Kent and Sussex. Trainees will benefit from weekly meetings, regular observations with constructive feedback, planning guidance and on-the-job advice.  [Click here](https://www.teachkentandsussex.org.uk/school-based-training/) for more information.\r\n\r\nTrainees will be regularly assessed against course curriculum expectations or Teaching Standards through a combination of informal and formal observations by their assigned mentor. For QTS, all Trainees are observed teaching in four separate year groups. They are also required to gather evidence in support of the Teaching Standards. \r\n\r\nTrainees have the opportunity to select from either a QTS or PGCE with QTS route. The PGCE route is the more academic option and essential if trainees wish to teach abroad. We offer this through the [University of Sussex](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/education/ite/pgcepp). [Click here](https://www.teachkentandsussex.org.uk/qts-pgce/) to find out more.\r\n\r\nWe also offer the course part-time (over two years). Please feel free to contact us at [traintoteach](mailto:traintoteach@claremont.kent.sch.uk) if you would like to discuss either the PGCE component or part-time option. \r\n\r\nThe Primary with Mathematics course includes additional support and training for subject knowledge and pedagogy ('how to teach') in relation to primary mathematics. ","interviewProcess":"Once an application is live on UCAS, it will be assessed for suitability. If an applicant is considered suitable, they will be invited to interview by Senior Mentor or senior member of staff within the partnership.\r\n\r\nAs part of our selection process you will need to:\r\n* Give a short presentation about how you have helped a small group of children or adults learn something (instructions will be given in advance).\r\n* Engage in a Reading Aloud task (instructions will be given in advance).\r\n* Participate in two informal discussions - one about the course and the other about the primary curriculum (no preparation is required in advance for the former and instructions will be given in advance for the latter)\r\n* Participate in a formal interview, during which you will be asked about why you wish to teach, and how you can show you have the capacity and personal characteristics to do so. \r\n* Complete a written task and a short Maths test (for which no preparation is required).\r\n* Complete our safe recruitment checklist and provide appropriate certificates (e.g. your degree certificate).","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The candidate's school will be carefully selected to meet the needs of both the candidate and the schools within the network. All schools used for teacher training have been graded Good by Ofsted, and many are Outstanding. All schools used are within Tunbridge Wells or the surrounding area.\r\n\r\nTrainees will have one placement at their main placement school (which will cover the teaching of three year groups) and one short term placement (lasting about six weeks) in a contrasting school. All trainees are required to gain experience and be assessed in four year groups and both primary key stages.\r\n\r\nPart-Time Course Arrangements:\r\nThe part-time course has a more flexible approach to school placements. For the duration of the two-year course, trainees will spend the equivalent of two days within their placement school. This could be four half days, two full days or a combination of both full and half days. Preferences will be explored as part of the interview process, and the pattern ultimately agreed with the main placement school. The contrasting placement will take place over two short terms on the part-time course.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, part-time trainees will be required to attend Professional Development sessions every Wednesday afternoon for the entire duration of the course. During the first year, these focus on teaching pedagogy, skills and current aspects of education, followed by the PGCE\r\nsessions in year two. The Wednesday afternoon sessions are immovable and a flexible approach cannot be taken with them. Therefore all candidates interested in the part-time course must be available on a Wednesday afternoon for the full two years.\r\n\r\nTrainees will also need to attend twilight subject tutor sessions during the two years. These typically take place twice a short term and might involve trainees attending the sessions on a day they would not normally be at their placement school. \r\n\r\nPlease contact us at [traintoteach](mailto:traintoteach@claremont.kent.sch.uk) if you would like to further discuss the arrangements for the part-time course.
