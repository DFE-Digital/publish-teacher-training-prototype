You will benefit from working and learning every day in a school and getting an immediate hands-on insight into what teaching involves.\r\n\r\nThe Manchester Nexus SCITT courses last one year. Trainees graduate with a Post Graduate certificate in education (PGCE) and QTS.\r\n\r\nYou'll receive lots of intensive support and training from experienced teachers and mentors right from the start, and throughout your course. The schools you're with won't ask you to teach classes unsupported until they think you're ready.\r\n\r\nSchool-led courses have very high rates of employment and trainee satisfaction as no other training route offers as much school based experience. You learn from current practicing teachers, in schools, so you develop skills and knowledge more quickly.\r\n\r\nThe programme is highly personalised from your first contact with us to taking up your first job, which is highly likely to be in a Manchester Nexus school. You will be based in a Manchester Nexus school from September where you will be trained and mentored by outstanding, specialist teachers in successful departments and Key Stages. Regular central training sessions bring you together with other trainees to learn from each other, share your insights and develop your professional skills.  You will soon find yourself in classrooms, and with full support and thorough preparation, will share the responsibility for planning and teaching your own groups.\r\n\r\nIn addition to school- based training for Qualified Teacher Status, our trainees achieve a PGCE with Master's level credits. For this part of the programme you will be taught by tutors from Liverpool Hope University, and have full access to the university's learning and research resources.","interviewProcess":"The Blue Coat School is the lead school in the partnership and will be co-ordinating the recruitment process.\r\n\r\nShortlisted candidates will be given the opportunity to learn more about the programme and meet the colleagues who will be involved in their training.\r\n\r\nWhere applicants have been shortlisted, you will be contacted to arrange a formal process which will consist of a remote panel interview, a remote presentation of a 20-minute lesson that you will have prepared prior to the interview. You will be told in advance about the content of the lesson and the age group you will be teaching. You will also complete a short written task and numeracy task following the interview. \r\n\r\nApplicants are also required to complete a rehabilitation of offenders declaration prior to interview. \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We follow an A/B/A Model which gives trainees access to a contrasting experience for enough time to allow strong relationships to be developed between trainees and their mentors, and trainees and their pupils. \r\n\r\nCandidates will spend two full terms in school A and one full term in school B. Trainees will receive focused mentor support during each placement. \r\nPlacement schools are selected based on capacity within schools and on the level of contrast compared to home school placement. Consideration is also given to travel time and personal circumstances. \r\n\r\nManchester Nexus currently partner with 20 secondary schools, allowing for a well considered process when placing trainees and a strong relationship with partners.\r\n\r\nCandidates teaching this subject will gain experience across the ages 11-16.","personalQualities":"We are looking for high calibre, highly motivated graduates who want to share their love of learning and their subjects with young people. Successful candidates will have a strong moral purpose and it will be important to them to provide equal opportunities to the young people across our partnership schools. Ideally, they will have an existing understanding of the importance of providing a secure and stimulating environment for all young people in an education setting.\r\n","otherRequirements":"At interview, you will be required to verify your identity, from a current photographic ID. A passport or driving licence and proof of address will be suitable. \r\n\r\nYou will be required to obtain a certificate for an enhanced DBS check as you will be engaging in regulated activity, if successful in your application for a training place.\r\n\r\nApplicants are also required to complete a rehabilitation of offenders declaration prior to interview.
