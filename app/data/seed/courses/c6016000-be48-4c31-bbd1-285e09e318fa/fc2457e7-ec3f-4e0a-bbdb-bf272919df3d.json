Our alliance consists of primary schools in Warrington as well as a special school and this allows you to have three contrasting placements during the programme. \r\n\r\nIn each placement you will be supported by a trained school mentor to develop your professional knowledge, understanding and the skills necessary to become a teacher.  The opportunity to work alongside colleagues from the start of the programme and immediately form relationships with the children are invaluable experiences which will enable you to become fully immersed in the life of the schools. \r\n\r\nThe placements in school are supported by a rigorous and comprehensive training programme, which are led by expert teachers and Specialist Leaders of Education.

These days will take place at a local training centre.\r\n\r\nThis course blends theories about learning with the wide range of skills that a teacher needs. We give you opportunities to carry out research into the aspects of teaching that capture your imagination. This helps you develop a reflective and analytical view of your work in the classroom, which sustains the high levels of progress we expect.\r\n\r\nYou learn about the curriculum, from the framework provided by the National Curriculum through to the individual lesson plans that teachers use to support learning in their classrooms. \r\n\r\nWe use a variety of methods and group sizes in our teaching, including subject methodology sessions where practical work is completed, small tutorial groups for discussing issues, mixed-subject research training activities, and other opportunities to share ideas and work with your peers.\r\n\r\nAssessment takes the form of three pieces of written coursework and a portfolio of evidence to demonstrate that you have met the standards for Qualified Teacher Status .","interviewProcess":"Park Road Primary School is the lead school in the primary partnership and will be co-ordinating the recruitment process.
