The PGCE (M) component is an academic qualification awarded by the university. It is recognised abroad. \r\n\r\nThe course also leads to the award of QTS (Qualified Teacher Status). QTS is a professional qualification awarded by the Department for Education. \r\n\r\nThe key aim of this programme is to enable trainees to become confident, knowledgeable and enthusiastic teachers. The programme provides opportunities for trainees to explore the theory and practice of teaching the subject through a range of lectures, workshops and tutorials, and to develop their expertise in the classroom through two contrasting school placements. \r\n\r\nTrainees are encouraged to develop their knowledge and understanding of the major religious traditions, other religious traditions and contemporary secular philosophies. Teaching is by specialists from the traditions but a central feature of the programme is the use of visits to faith communities. We have good relations with communities representing the Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim and Sikh faiths. Trainees are expected to look critically at the difficult philosophical issues raised by religion and to develop their thinking about the place and significance of religion today. There is a strong emphasis not only on what we can learn about religions, but what we can learn from religion, even if we do not share a particular religious world view. In schools, this will mean examining practical strategies for enabling religion to contribute to pupils' spiritual, moral, social and cultural development.\r\n\r\nThere are three written assignments set and assessed by the university towards the Masters level PGCE element of the qualification. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Applicants are welcome to contact us via the address below to send a CV in advance of applying, or to ask questions about our schools, our training programmes or the application process. \r\n\r\nIf you have applied, meet the entry requirements and demonstrate the skills needed  for school based teacher training you will be invited to an interview including the following activities: a short classroom based activity, an interview with heads or School Direct leads from our partner schools, and a short written task set by the university. \r\n\r\nMost of our interviews are held at Dunraven School.

Trainees have opportunities to observe excellent teaching before experimenting with approaches to teaching and learning across the secondary age range, during which time they are supervised and supported by teachers and tutors. They begin with a light teaching timetable which is gradually increased as they become more skilled and confident.\r\n\r\nThe main focus of this training programme is classroom practice and the development of the knowledge, skills and understanding needed to ensure that pupils make excellent progress in their learning. Trainees are supported by both a school based mentor and a university tutor working in partnership to support them. They are experienced and skilled in classroom observation, giving feedback and setting targets for development.  Trainees have full support in developing their behaviour management skills throughout the year.  Placements will be in Key Stage 3 and Key Stage 4, ages 11-16, with some opportunity to experience Key Stage 5 and the primary curriculum. Trainees are based in school throughout the year, except when they have sessions at the university, usually on Wednesdays. Trainees have a six week second placement in a contrasting school, usually another local partnership school.\r\n\r\nProfessional development is supported by an extensive programme of in-school training to enrich their experience, delivered by expert practitioners in the Partnership, in addition to the Masters level PGCE programme delivered by the University of Roehampton.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the year trainees are in school full time, until training is complete in late June. School Direct trainees are expected to become fully involved in the life of the school to enhance their knowledge and understanding of the profession.","personalQualities":"We are looking for applicants who are passionate about teaching their subject and have the potential to become outstanding teachers.
