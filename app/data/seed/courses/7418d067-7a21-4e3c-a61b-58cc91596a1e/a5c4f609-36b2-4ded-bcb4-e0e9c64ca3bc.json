It has been designed to enable you to demonstrate evidence of having met the Teachers’ Standards that lead to Qualified Teacher Status. Whilst undertaking the University-led PGCE route into teaching you will work towards securing 60 Master’s level credits. This is an integral part of the programme. We strongly believe that innovative and effective teaching and learning is made possible through a teacher’s full engagement with research informed practice and underpinning theories of learning. This is fostered in two modules and developed through School Based Training. You will be well supported in becoming a critically reflective teacher capable of inspiring pupils to learn, achieve and flourish.\r\n\r\nYou will be supported and taught by specialist tutors with excellent experience, knowledge and research informed expertise. Partnership schools provide opportunities for you to learn about pedagogical approaches relevant to your subject specialism and the professional responsibilities of all teachers.\r\n\r\nYou will have two School Based Training placements, where, with the support of a teacher mentor and a university subject tutor, you will develop your skills to become an excellent classroom teacher. Training to teach is exciting, rewarding and demanding. By the end of the course you will be well prepared for employment as a Newly Qualified Teacher (NQT).\r\n","interviewProcess":"The ability to train to teach is assessed first on application and then at interview.
