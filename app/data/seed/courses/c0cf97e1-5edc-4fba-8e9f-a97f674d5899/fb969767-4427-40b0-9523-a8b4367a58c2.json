It will enable them to follow a particular interest in mathematics, possibly leading to subject leadership and/or specialist teaching of mathematics in their future career.\r\n\r\nFor this School Direct course, St Polycarp's Educational Partnership works in close partnership with the University of Reading. The course offers a high-quality, school-focused and personalised approach to trainees from diverse backgrounds and experiences.\r\n\r\nThis course, W514, is a one-year full-time route into teaching, leading to the award of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) on successful completion.\r\n\r\nTrainees spend most of their time in school, with approximately 30 days based at the University of Reading on its London Road campus. They are based in one school for most of the year, with a minimum of six weeks in a contrasting school to broaden their training experience.\r\n\r\nThe course begins in early September, and finishes at the beginning of July the following summer.\r\n\r\nInitially, trainees will be observing and working alongside class teachers as they get to know the children and their routines. At a pace tailored to each individual, they will then begin to take on small groups, building up to being responsible for planning, teaching and assessing the children for 80% of their timetable by the end of the year. This ensures that trainees are completely confident in their teaching skills before entering the teaching profession.","interviewProcess":"St Polycarp's Educational Partnership will take the lead in interviewing once we have received your application through Apply.
