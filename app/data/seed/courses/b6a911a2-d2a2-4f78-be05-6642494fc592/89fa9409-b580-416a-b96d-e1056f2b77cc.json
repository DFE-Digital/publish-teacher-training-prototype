In order for your application to be considered you should consider your personal statement as being an important part of this process.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nWe require two references one of which will be an academic reference. If you completed your studies more than five years ago your employer should provide your first reference.\r\n\r\nInterview\r\n\r\nWe will interview all shortlisted candidates prior to making an offer of training. If you are invited to interview, we expect knowledge of key aspects of education and excellent subject knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe interview process will include\r\n\r\nTeaching a short lesson\r\nWritten tasks\r\nA formal interview\r\nYou will be assessed on your ability to communicate clearly and engage the audience.\r\n\r\nAll teachers need to be able to write English clearly without errors in spelling, punctuation or grammar because this is part of the job. Therefore there will be a literacy written task as part of the selection process as well as a subject related written task.\r\n\r\nThe interview will assess you on the following criteria:-\r\n\r\nAppropriateness of subject qualifications\r\nCapacity to expand subject knowledge\r\nAwareness of the roles and responsibilities of a teacher\r\nAny teaching or school based experience\r\nResilience\r\nAbility to communicate effectively\r\nEnthusiasm for, and commitment to teaching\r\nSelf-awareness of both strengths and areas to improve","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The training model is very much rooted in the philosophy of our mission statement, viewing all as life-long learners.\r\n\r\nWe find the following definition of pedagogy useful:-\r\n\r\nPedagogy is the act of teaching together with its attendant discourse. It is what one needs to know, and the skills one needs to command in order to make and justify the many different kinds of decisions of which teaching is constituted (Alexander 2003)\r\n\r\nYou will have two teaching placements in contrasting schools covering at least two different key stages.\r\n\r\nThe training will follow what is commonly referred to as an ABA model. The second placement (B) is six weeks and takes place in the spring term.\r\n\r\nTherefore most of the training year will be spent in your main placement school (A), allowing you to get to know the systems, students and staff.\r\n\r\nYou will get weekly input on subject pedagogy as well as professional studies. These sessions will be delivered by very experienced practicing teachers, a key part of our training model.","personalQualities":"Enthusiasm for teaching\r\n\r\nPositive attitudes to young people and their education\r\n\r\nUnderstanding of the importance of establishing respectful, supportive and constructive relationships\r\n\r\nAbility to communicate effectively and accurately in standard spoken and written English\r\n\r\nAbility to reflect critically and creatively\r\n\r\nA good sense of humour\r\n\r\nEvidence of wider educational reading and knowledge of key issues facing today's educators\r\n\r\nA sense of the scope of teachers' professional skills and responsibilities\r\n\r\nUnderstanding ‘Fundamental British - Values’ and its importance to all aspects of teaching\r\n\r\nAwareness of key safeguarding issues\r\n\r\nCommitment to inclusion and equal opportunity\r\n\r\nA strong work ethic","otherRequirements":"Equivalency testing\r\n\r\nA NARIC statement of comparability should be provided for non UK GCSE and degree level qualifications.\r\n\r\nLiteracy and Numeracy\r\n\r\nCandidates are expected to be competent in fundamental English and Mathematics.
