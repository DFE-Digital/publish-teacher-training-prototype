The programme provides you with a rich, cohesive and personalised experience of initial teacher training that will enable you to become a confident, competent and excellent teacher, critically aware of your own and others' educational philosophy and practice. \r\nThe programme has four components: host-school experience, professional practice, taught sessions and a PGCE. School-based experience includes observation of experienced teachers at work, team teaching, working with small groups and with whole classes.\r\nDuring the Host-School Experience you spend a mix of time in your host school and training at the lead school in the primary, Aragon Primary. During this period, we also begin to construct your individual training plan taking into account your previous achievements. \r\nWhilst completing your host-school experience you will also receive dedicated training led by our tutors each week. Some of the sessions will be subject-focused sessions aimed at developing best practice and pedagogy through reflecting on your school-based experience and the literature. In addition professional studies will develop the core skills and competencies of teaching. Some Professional Studies are led by our central team and provides a unifying strand to the programme as a whole and ensures that trainees' subjects are placed in the whole-school and education system context. \r\nYou will have two formal periods of professional practice in which you will take on the role of a practising teacher with curriculum and pastoral responsibilities. Whilst on professional practice you will be supported by your school-based mentor who is responsible for supporting your development. Mentors have all undergone extensive training which enables them to support you as a coach, role model and trainer. \r\nThe PGCE primary course is assessed by means of three assignments. These are closely linked to your work in schools and are designed to encourage reflection on the practical and theoretical perspectives of teaching and learning. \r\nYour school experience and your school-based learning are assessed throughout the year. To be recommended for QTS you must demonstrate through your profile and portfolio that you have met the Teachers' Standards.\r\n","interviewProcess":"If your application is successful you will be invited to an assessment day at one of our schools.
