The two main placements will provide each School Direct candidate with a range of teaching experience ranging from Nursery to Year 6.\r\n\r\nWith our School Direct programme, trainees will begin their journey at the lead school of the alliance on the first day of term in September for an induction day.  This will mean that they immediately feel part of the group of schools that will guide them on their teacher training journey.  This will also give the students a chance to meet the other students that are also taking part in the Salford Alliance of Learning Schools School Direct programme.  Trainees can be placed in any two of the schools within the alliance and will always have a key mentor at the schools that they are based.\r\n","personalQualities":"Salford Alliance of Learning Schools are looking for passionate, well-motivated candidates who are looking to inspire a new generation of children in our community through their exceptional teaching.
