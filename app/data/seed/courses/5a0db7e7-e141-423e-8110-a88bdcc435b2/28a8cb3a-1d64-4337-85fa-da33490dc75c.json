We have a well established partnership with over 800 secondary schools and colleges across the North West region and beyond.\r\n\r\nReligious Education is a demanding curriculum area where pupils reflect on their own beliefs and values and develop critical thinking skills to enable positive action in their communities. Trainees will encounter cultural diversity through visits to places of worship from the six major religions in Manchester and engage in dialogue with people from other faiths and cultural backgrounds. There is an emphasis on both practical and theoretical teaching skills.\r\n\r\nA minimum of 120 days school based practice training is combined with university based training and periods of independent study.  Trainees are supported throughout by university and placement mentors.\r\n\r\nWe have state-of-the-art teaching facilities at the £139 million Brooks Building in Manchester.\r\n\r\nReligious Education is a shortage subject and the opportunities for gaining a first appointment are very good. Many RE teachers become heads of department early in their career, as they are often quite small departments which have considerable autonomy. Since Religious Education includes aspects of pastoral care and cross curricular dimensions, such as Personal, Social and Health Education and Citizenship which open up the wider aspects of teaching, opportunities for promotion are very good.","interviewProcess":"BTHCC is the Lead School in the partnership and will be coordinating the recruitment process. \r\n\r\nYou are welcome to visit the school prior to application - please  contact school on 0161 911 8090.\r\n\r\nInterviews will usually take place at BTHCC.\r\nWhen you come for a School Direct interview there are likely to be other applicants being interviewed alongside you.
