And, you’ll share your specialist art and design skills with your group too (students from past years have shared skills including bookbinding and Photoshop).\r\n\r\nWhile you’re at Manchester Met, you’ll mainly study with your art and design group. You’ll consider how to plan lessons, reflect on your planning, look at ways to develop your teacher persona and understand how research can develop and influence your teaching practice.\r\n\r\nYou’ll spend at least 120 days on placements in schools – gradually becoming the class teacher.\r\n\r\nTrainees will be introduced to different models of critical engagement and be involved in a number of gallery education workshops at various stages in the course.
