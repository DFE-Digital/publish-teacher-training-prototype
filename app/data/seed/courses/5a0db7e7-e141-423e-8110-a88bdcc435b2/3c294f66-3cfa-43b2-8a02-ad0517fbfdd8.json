These routes will equip you with the skills and experience to teach at GCSE and A/AS levels, and vocational qualifications in both Computer Science and ICT. \r\n\r\nSubject to confirmation of DfE funding, we usually run free pre-entry SKE and booster courses for national priority subjects, including Computing. These will be identified at interview for applicants who need support in some areas and confirmed with a PGCE place offer.\r\n\r\nPGCE trainees will examine the theory and practice of computing, together with approaches to more general ICT skills and issues as they apply to teaching in the secondary school context.  We work in close partnership with schools in designing, delivering and assessing the course.\r\n\r\nA minimum of 120 days school based practice training is combined with university based training and periods of independent study.  Trainees are supported throughout by university and placement mentors.\r\n\r\nWe have state-of-the-art teaching facilities at the £139 million Brooks Building in Manchester.","interviewProcess":"BTHCC is the Lead School in the partnership and will be coordinating the recruitment process. \r\n\r\nYou are welcome to visit the school prior to application - please email robertmcguinness@bthcc.org\r\n\r\nInterviews will usually take place at BTHCC.\r\nWhen you come for a School Direct interview there are likely to be other applicants being interviewed alongside you.
