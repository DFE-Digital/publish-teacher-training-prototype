Past projects include creating a pencil case with LEDs, building a basic circuit, and using a 3D printer to print textiles.\r\n\r\nThrough these practical workshops you’ll explore some of the issues students might have, such as using complex machinery or working with soldering irons. You’ll also look at ways to make sure you’re imparting educational knowledge through each project, such as electronic calculations or weaves of fabric.\r\nYou’ll attend Critical Skills lectures and workshops once a week in mixed groups with students from other subject areas.\r\n\r\nThese sessions help you to develop skills outside of your subject knowledge. Some of the topics you’ll explore include behaviour management, mental health and emotional wellbeing, teacher persona, and non-verbal communication (such as body language).\r\n\r\nYou’ll also develop your research skills during these lectures, analysing the latest educational research and theories. \r\n\r\nWhen you go for interviews for your first teaching post, you’ll be expected to present a portfolio of your work alongside your interview. To make sure your portfolio is ready for interviews, you’ll work on it from December. This gives you time to make sure that you have all of the pieces of work that you’d like to showcase to schools.\r\n\r\nYou’ll go on your first block placement in late September, where you’ll put the skills you’ve learnt at University into practice and build your confidence in the classroom.\r\n\r\nYou’ll be involved in all aspects of teaching, from marking work to delivering lessons to helping with parents’ evenings.\r\n\r\nWhen you’re on placement, you’ll have a school mentor (often the class teacher) to help you with day-to-day matters, and receive regular visits from your personal tutor and visiting tutor.\r\n\r\nIn the spring term, you’ll complete a short placement in a primary school. This experience helps to broaden your knowledge of teaching methods and develop your teaching skills.\r\n\r\nUnits on this course may include:\r\n\r\nSubject Pedagogy\r\nCritical Studies\r\nReflection on Professional Development\r\nPractice Credit Unit – Placement Block A\r\nPractice Credit Unit – Placement Block B\r\n","interviewProcess":"BTHCC is the Lead School in the partnership and will be coordinating the recruitment process. \r\n\r\nYou are welcome to visit the school prior to application - please ring the school reception 0161 911 8090 \r\n\r\nInterviews will usually take place at BTHCC.\r\nWhen you come for a School Direct interview there are likely to be other applicants being interviewed alongside you.
