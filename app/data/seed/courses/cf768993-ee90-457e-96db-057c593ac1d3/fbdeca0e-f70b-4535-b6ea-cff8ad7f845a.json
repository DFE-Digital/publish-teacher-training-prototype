A fully comprehensive training programme is in place and ensures complete coverage of the primary curriculum.” Ofsted 2017\r\n\r\n\r\nThis programme aims to support you to become an outstanding primary class teacher, whilst developing your knowledge in maths, with the view that you will use this specialism to impact on our schools as you progress through your career. \r\n\r\nOur SCITT / School Direct training route provides all trainees with a blend of school experience underpinned by an innovative and thorough taught programme, leading to the award of QTS and a PGCE, with our partners Nottingham Trent University. \r\n\r\nTrainees spend the greatest proportion of their time in school – please see ‘how placements work’.\r\n\r\nThe taught programme is delivered by outstanding practitioners, who work as teachers in our schools and as leaders of their subjects. This includes English, Maths, Science, Teaching & Learning, Inclusion and the Foundation Subjects – all up to date theory and practice that is being used with high impact in our schools now. As practising teachers who also guide other schools, our trainers have a wealth of current experience and ideas that you can use. The taught days, alongside a range of fun and immersive opportunities, including our residential, will ensure that you remain motivated throughout the programme and driven to become an exceptional teacher:\r\n“Laura, Tom and Cath inspired us throughout the programme, kept us going when things got hard and gave us new and innovative ideas to try in the classroom”- ILTT Trainee 2017/ 18.\r\n\r\nIn addition, you will have the opportunity to access specialist training days and experiences to develop your specialism in Maths, overseen by a national mastery specialist teacher.\r\n\r\nNottingham Trent University provide the PGCE qualification, which brings 60 masters credits.

It is in school where your teaching is shaped and your individual development needs addressed.\r\nSchool placements are not just about being in class – you will be part of the school team, taking a full part in the life of the school and making a real difference to the experiences for the children.\r\nOur General Primary course will require you working in two contrasting schools across our partnership.\r\nWe call these placements your host and your alternative school. You will complete your placement at your host school in the Autumn and Summer term, whilst your alternative placement will be completed in the Spring term. With each placement, you will change year group to gain experience over three age phases: Year 1 or 2; Year 3 or 4; Year 5 or 6.\r\nHost placements are decided based on your home location, your access to transport and other needs. \r\nAlternative placements are still arranged considering your travel, but are also selected to give you a contrasting experience and meet your emerging needs.\r\n\r\nIn each placement you will work in partnership with a Class Mentor, to the advantage of the children, planning and reviewing together. Your class mentor will give you on-going advice and model good practice.\r\nYour professional progress will be supported by an experienced teacher in school – your Learning Coach, who will observe and meet with you weekly.\r\n“I am in no doubt that the support I received from my in-school learning coach enabled me to complete this course and secure my first job as a teacher”- trainee 2017/18\r\n\r\nYour Professional Tutor will work closely with your host school and make visits during the placements.\r\n\r\n\r\n[For more information about our course, click here](https://www.inspiringleadersscitt.com/the-course)\r\n","personalQualities":"At Inspiring Leaders Teacher Training we are looking for 5 key qualities in our trainee teachers.
