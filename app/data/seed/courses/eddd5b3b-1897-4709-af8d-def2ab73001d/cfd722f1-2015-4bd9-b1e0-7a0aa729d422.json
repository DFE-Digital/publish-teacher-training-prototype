Successful candidates are then informed of the outcome within two working days of the interview date.\r\n\r\nWhere the application is for a Schools Direct Salaried training place - applicants will be required to attend a second interview with their placement school.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware - if you apply for a salaried place, but do not have the support of a school, whilst we will do our best to find an employing school to facilitate this place, it may not always be possible and a tuition fee place may be offered instead.’\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"For the Salaried School Direct programme - school placements are allocated in line with local need and where a training vacancy exists within one of our Partnership schools.\r\nAs part of the training programme, all applicants will have two school placements which will enable them to teach across two consecutive age ranges focusing on KS3 & 4.These will take the form of a main school placement in a Secondary or Upper school and a shorter complementary placement.\r\nDuring the training year, applicants will be allocated a subject specialist mentor within the appropriate age phase to oversee their training and development in both their main school placement and also in their six week second placement.\r\n","personalQualities":"We welcome applications from all suitably qualified applicants. \r\n\r\nAs Salaried applicants are required to deliver a teaching timetable from the outset - it would be helpful if they have had some previous relevant teaching experience - although this is a recommendation and not an entry requirement.   \r\n\r\nDue to the lack of any government funding for this course - there is no guarantee that we will be able to secure you a school training placement - unless you already have an existing relationship and support of a school.\r\n","otherRequirements":"In line with current safeguarding practice,  we (or the employing school) will carry out a number of pre-employment checks, including taking up references and a DBS Clearance check for all trainees prior to the start of the course.\r\n\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:49:21.012Z","updatedAt":"2022-01-06T13:49:17.770Z","canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","cycle":"2024","salaryDetails":"As a Salaried School Direct applicant, you will be employed and paid on the bottom of the unqualified teacher scale by your placement school for the duration of your training placement.There are no tuition fees attached to this course and upon successful completion of the training programme, applicants will receive the award of QTS.
