We `have created a culture where high standards and a passion for improving outcomes for pupils permeate every aspect of the course’ [(Outstanding Ofsted 2015)](https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report/provider/ELS/70163).\r\n\r\nThe unsalaried primary with mathematics course is designed for students with an interest in mathematics and strong subject knowledge in this subject. It is designed to prepare trainees for a subject leadership role in mathematics  through exposing them to exceptional practice in mathematics in our 80 partnership schools.  Trainees on this course will have additional training sessions and school based tasks to deepen their understanding and reflection on key elements underpinning effective primary mathematics teaching and learning.  An expert consultant in primary mathematics will support our mathematics specialist trainees in school placements. \r\n\r\nAn integral part of the courses is a full University of Leicester PGCE, with Masters Level credits.  One of the two 5000 word PGCE assignments will be a small-scale research project, carried out by the trainee, on an element of mathematics teaching. \r\n\r\nIn 2019/20 the DfE provided tax free non repayable bursaries of £6000 to trainees on this course with a B or above in A level mathematics.  DfE bursaries for 2020/21  have not yet been announced. \r\n \r\nIn addition to specialist mathematics sessions, you will be part of a cohort of 30-35 trainees, all specialising in teaching KS1 and KS2 pupils. Training sessions for the cohort take place in bespoke training rooms within schools.  Sessions are dynamic and engaging and each trainee will very quickly become known as a unique individual so SCITT trainers and management can mould training and select placements to fit each individual’s needs, working exactly as skilled teachers do with their pupils.  This is a key strength of our programmes, making the training very personalised so that each individual  trainee is both challenged and supported to reach their full potential.  \r\n\r\nGood subject knowledge underpins effective teaching, and as [OFSTED](https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/provider/41/70163)  recognised  \"Many former trainees rise to positions of leadership within their schools due to the quality of their preparation for teaching.\"  Headteachers, SCITT trained teachers and trainees are unanimous is stating that the course structure is an ideal balance of theory, research  and practice. \r\n\r\n\"The SCITT believed in me from day one, before I even believed in myself\"\r\nSteven (Trainee 18/19)\r\n","interviewProcess":"The SCITT and School Direct partner alliances, will use a two stage interview process for candidates called to interview, normally held on two separate days. It may be possible to hold both interviews on the same day for candidates who need to travel further or candidates who will find attending interview for two half days particularly difficult.   \r\n\r\nAs part of our selection process all candidates will be asked to complete written audits in English and mathematics.  The written audits assess whether each candidate’s personal subject knowledge in English and mathematics is sufficient to form a secure base to underpin high quality teaching of these subjects in the primary school. \r\n\r\n [Audit Information and Preparation Advice](https://leics-scitt.co.uk/entry-requirements/our-interview-process/) \r\n\r\nThe interview process will also take place in our partner schools and will involve a combination of tasks including:  \r\n\r\n* a presentation, connected to current educational issues;  \r\n\r\n* a task working with a small group of early primary or primary pupils;  \r\n\r\n* a formal interview;  \r\n\r\n* a reading task.  \r\n\r\nEach part of the selection procedure will be graded to agreed criteria. The interview questions will be largely based on elements that will contribute to the Teachers’ Standards. Equal opportunities procedures will be followed to ensure that the selection procedures are open, fair and assessments are to agreed criteria.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The SCITT partnership knows trainees can only reach their potential if given exceptional support in placements. Teaching is about relationships; and the relationship between a trainee and their class teacher on placement is vitally important.  The trust and loyalty of headteachers and teachers in our partner schools, built up over the last 15 years, is a key strength of our training. The TOP 4  Primary Schools in Leicester/shire are part of the SCITT partnership, offering SCITT student placements and employing SCITT NQTs. [The Real Schools Guide 2019](https://leics-scitt.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/TOP-ten-schools-2019.pdf) \r\n\r\nThe consistently high quality of support on three contrasting school placements, from dedicated and enthusiastic teachers, underpins our success, making us one of the very top teacher training providers in the country [The Good Teacher Training Guides](https://www.buckingham.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/GTTG17fin.pdf) .  This maximises opportunities for each trainee to learn from best practice in different settings.  Our trainees complete training confident across the key stages and fully prepared to work in a wide variety of schools, ready to serve diverse pupil populations. \r\n\r\nPlacements are carefully matched to trainees’ development needs so mathematics specialists will be placed in schools and classes where they can easily engage in dialogue with subject leaders and classteachers about best practice in teaching mathematics. The SCITT mathematics subject leader will also support the mathematics specialists through each of the school placements to maximise learning and development in this area of the curriculum for these specialists and future mathematics subject leaders. \r\n\r\nThe autumn placement starts with an introduction week, followed by a 7 week block.  Spring and summer terms have the same introduction week, followed by a 6 and 9 week block respectively.  We have over 60 partner primary schools across the city and county which offers trainees a wide range of schools in which to gain experience.  \r\n\r\n[Ofsted](https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report/provider/ELS/70163) reported that “Placement schools are very carefully allocated to provide trainees with teaching experiences across the whole 5-11 age range in a variety of settings. This is an outstanding feature of the training.”\r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for talented, creative individuals, with a passion for teaching across a wide range of subjects within the primary curriculum. Good communication skills are at the heart of effective teaching and all applicants are expected to demonstrate excellent interpersonal and communication skills.  \r\n\r\nTeachers in schools know that teaching demands stamina and perseverance. We look for applicants with the resilience and determination required to cope with the demands of teaching.  \r\n\r\nWe aim to recruit a range of good role models representative of the local population, particularly from minority ethnic communities and men. We also encourage LSAs and career changers.\r\n","otherRequirements":"A commitment to undertake teacher training is a major step. As such it is important applicants make this commitment based on a first hand understanding of the pressures and rewards of working in a British primary school in the twenty first century. Applicants are strongly encouraged to have a minimum of one week’s relevant and recent experience in a primary school. We feel this is advantageous to demonstrate your understanding of teaching and learning in your interview.    \r\n\r\nApplicants will need to pass health and DBS police checks and have the physical and mental fitness to teach.  \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:58.569Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-01T12:57:38.487Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"}
