Our unsalaried Early Primary (EP) (3-7yr) course is designed to ensure that you complete training with a comprehensive understanding of how young children develop and learn.  You will be tutored on three specialist, quality, contrasting placements in both Early Years Foundation Stage and Key Stage One . Here you will be able to use and develop your toolkit of teaching skills which have been underpinned by engaging central training, delivered in bespoke training rooms in our primary school base. You will learn about research-based learning theories in practical hands-on lessons, demonstrated by skilled, passionate trainers. This consistently rated [OFSTED](https://files.api.ofsted.gov.uk/v1/file/2535240)  outstanding programme offers 60 full days of central training, more than the majority of current ITT programmes. Trainees enter their NQT year confident and secure in their understanding of both the EYFS and KS1.\r\n\r\nA key strength of our programme is making the training personalised so that all trainees are challenged and supported at every step in becoming the best teacher they can be. The SCITT outcomes in terms of the percentage of trainees awarded QTS and gaining employment are at the top of the DfE tables for providers in Leicestershire (provider performance profiles). In the last 3 years over 97% of our trainees have been graded as `Good’ or `Outstanding’ against the Teachers’ Standards at the end of training. \r\n\r\nThe EP course, leads to QTS across the full (3-11yr) primary age range. You will graduate with a full University of Leicester internationally recognised Masters level PGCE and have full use of the University facilities.\r\n\r\nGraduates of this course often rapidly gain leadership positions in Early Primary teams as their career progresses. Equally, the skills gained mean that graduates are also able to take up positions in Key Stage 2.\r\nThe best way to get to know if a course is right for you is to come and meet us.

Comprehensive training, wide variety of settings, excellent support, prepared me for life as a teacher.” Rachel, 2019\r\n\r\nIn the most recent [`Good Teacher Training Guide’]( https://www.buckingham.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/GTTG17fin.pdf) the SCITT is in the top five Initial Teacher Training (ITT) providers nationally and is the top primary provider in the East Midlands.\r\n","interviewProcess":"The SCITT and School Direct partner alliances, will use a two stage interview process for candidates called to interview, normally held on two separate days. It may be possible to hold both interviews on the same day for candidates who need to travel further or candidates who will find attending interview for two half days particularly difficult.  \r\n\r\nAs part of our selection process all candidates will be asked to complete written audits in English and mathematics.  These audits assess whether each candidate’s personal subject knowledge in English and mathematics is sufficient to underpin their professional role and high quality teaching of these subjects in the primary school. \r\n\r\nPreparation materials and information about the interview audits are attached here: \r\n[Audit Information] (https://leics-scitt.co.uk/entry-requirements/our-interview-process/)\r\n\r\nThe interview process will also take place in our partner schools and will involve a combination of tasks including: \r\n\r\n*a presentation, connected to current educational issues; \r\n\r\n*a task working with a small group of early primary or primary pupils; \r\n\r\n*a formal interview; \r\n\r\n*a reading task. \r\n\r\nEach part of the selection procedure will be graded to agreed criteria. The interview questions will be largely based on elements that will contribute to the Teachers’ Standards. Equal opportunities procedures will be followed to ensure that the selection procedures are open, fair and assessments are to agreed criteria.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The SCITT partnership knows trainees can only reach their potential if given exceptional support in placements. Teaching is about relationships; and the relationship between a trainee and their class teacher on placement is vitally important.  The trust and loyalty of headteachers and teachers in our partner schools, built up over the last 15 years, is a key strength of our training. 7 of the Top 10 Primary Schools in Leicestershire (including the TOP 3) are part of the SCITT partnership, offering SCITT student placements and employing SCITT NQTs. [The Real Schools Guide 2019](https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/news/leicester-news/best-state-funded-primary-schools-2423922) \r\n\r\nThe consistently high quality of support on 3 different school placements, from dedicated and enthusiastic teachers, underpins our success, making us one of the very top teacher training providers in the country [The Good Teacher Training Guides](https://www.buckingham.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/GTTG17fin.pdf).  This maximises opportunities for each trainee to learn from best practice in different settings.  Our trainees complete training confident across the EYFS and Key Stage 1 and are fully prepared to work in a wide variety of schools, ready to serve diverse pupil populations.  \r\n\r\nPlacements are carefully matched to trainee’s development needs and SCITT management also take into account the fact that trainees may be using public transport to reach placement schools.  Trainees with children are always thought about carefully so as to best support them as they juggle teaching demands with their own childcare arrangements.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOfsted (2016) reported that “Placement schools are very carefully allocated to provide trainees with teaching experiences across the whole 5-11 age range in a variety of settings. This is an outstanding feature of the training.” \r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for talented, creative individuals, with a passion for teaching across a wide range of subjects within the primary curriculum. Good communication skills are at the heart of effective teaching and all applicants are expected to demonstrate excellent interpersonal and communication skills. \r\n\r\nTeachers in schools know that teaching demands stamina and perseverance. We look for applicants with the resilience and determination required to cope with the demands of teaching. \r\n\r\nWe aim to recruit a range of good role models representative of the local population, particularly from minority ethnic communities and men. We also encourage LSAs and career changers.\r\n","otherRequirements":"A commitment to undertake teacher training is a major step. As such it is important applicants make this commitment based on a first hand understanding of the pressures and rewards of working in a British primary school in the twenty first century. Applicants are strongly encouraged to have a minimum of one week’s relevant and recent experience in a primary school. We feel this is advantageous to demonstrate your understanding of teaching and learning in your interview.   \r\n\r\nApplicants will need to pass health and DBS police checks and have the physical and mental fitness to teach. \r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:58.535Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-24T12:31:28.068Z","cycle":"2023","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"}
