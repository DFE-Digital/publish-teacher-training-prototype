It is specifically designed to utilise your academic expertise to the benefit of pupils, schools and universities. RIS is a three year programme, for details please refer to the RIS website: https://researchersinschools.org/\r\n\r\nIn the first year all RIS participants complete Initial Teacher Training to gain Qualified Teacher status. RIS participants at the LWA SCITT follow the School Direct programme as outlined below.\r\n\r\nThe School Direct 11-16 course is aimed at developing the professional skills, knowledge and understanding necessary to become an outstanding reflective practitioner who can provide creative, challenging and purposeful teaching.  Embedded in a school from the beginning of the course you will receive training on one day a week, enabling you to make immediate links between taught sessions and school experience. These are delivered by outstanding current practitioners, with the support of experienced and specially trained school mentors. The course is active and demanding, including simulations of classroom activities, group sessions and sharing developments in pedagogy. \r\n\r\nThe course is supported by the expertise of Roehampton University who provide teaching and academic support for a PGCE (M), library access and taught sessions by subject tutors. Written assignments give you the opportunity to explore the most recent developments into teaching and learning and to research an aspect of your practice in school. \r\n\r\nThe course is designed for those intending to teach French, Spanish or German as their subject specialism; all students must be able to offer French as either their first or second teaching language. The aim of the course is to give you an understanding of a variety of ways in which modern languages are taught in schools, including the use of the target language as the principal means of classroom communication.\r\nYou will be encouraged to try out a wide range of approaches to teaching and assessment, as well as strategies for organising the classroom for effective learning. \r\nYou will acquire an understanding of the structure and demands of the National Curriculum orders for modern foreign languages, and of the public examination system and E-Bacc. Although the course is officially designated as an 11-16 qualification, all students will have the chance to plan and teach at A-level.\r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"A rigorous selection and interview process is undertaken so that only candidates with excellent subject knowledge and aptitude for teaching enter the programme. Interviews take place at a number of schools in the London West Alliance and at the LWA SCITT. The interview process is designed to assess suitability to teach and will focus on the applicant’s \r\n•\tCommunication skills\r\n•\tPotential to teach and understanding of a teacher’s role\r\n•\tSubject knowledge\r\n•\tPersonal, organisational and transferrable skills\r\nThe assessment day consists of the following:\r\n•\tA short teaching activity with pupils focused on clear communication and potential to teach\r\n•\tA group activity focussed on communication and listening skills and the candidates’ vision and values about teaching\r\n•\tA panel interview\r\n•\tConfirmation of identity and qualifications\r\n•\tThe opportunity to identify development needs\r\n\r\nAfter the assessment day you will receive formal notification via UCAS. You may be made a conditional offer (For example, dependent on the skills tests, equivalency testing, subject knowledge enhancement courses). You may be made an unconditional offer (still subject to enhanced safeguarding clearance).
