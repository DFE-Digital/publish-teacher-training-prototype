Embedded in a school from the beginning of the course you will receive training on one day a week, enabling you to make immediate links between taught sessions and school experience. Delivered by outstanding current practitioners, with the support of experienced and specially trained school mentors, the course is innovative in its approach to general professional studies, using the expertise of the Teaching School and its partners to inform the programme. The course is active and demanding, including simulations of classroom activities, group sessions and sharing developments in pedagogy. These sessions provide support and challenge to help you progress. Assignments for QTS are focused on your direct experience in the classroom. Trainees may take up a teaching post in the placement school following graduation but this is not guaranteed.  \r\n\r\nThe course is supported by the expertise of Roehampton University who provide teaching and academic support for a PGCE (M), library access and taught sessions by subject tutors. Written assignments give you the opportunity to explore the most recent developments into teaching and learning and to research an aspect of your practice in school.\r\n\r\nThe course encourages you to develop your knowledge and understanding of the major religious traditions, other religious traditions and contemporary secular philosophies. We have good relations with communities representing the Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim and Sikh faiths. West London students in schools offer an invaluable resource.\r\nYou will also be expected to look critically at the difficult philosophical issues raised by religion and to develop your thinking about the place and significance of religion today. Thus there is a strong emphasis not only on what we can learn about religions, but what we can learn from religion, even if we do not share a particular religious world view. In schools, this will mean examining practical strategies for enabling religion to contribute to pupils’ spiritual, moral, social and cultural development.\r\nYou will have access to a post 16 experience, to the primary curriculum and have a second placement in a contrasting school as part of the course.\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"A rigorous selection and interview process is undertaken so that only candidates with excellent subject knowledge and aptitude for teaching enter the programme.
