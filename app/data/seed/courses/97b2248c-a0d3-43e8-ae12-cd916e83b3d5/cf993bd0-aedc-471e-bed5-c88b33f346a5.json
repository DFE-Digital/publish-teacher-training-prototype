It is specifically designed to utilise your academic expertise to the benefit of pupils, schools and universities. RIS is a three year programme, for details please refer to the RIS website: https://researchersinschools.org/\r\n\r\nIn the first year all RIS participants complete Initial Teacher Training to gain Qualified Teacher status. RIS participants at the LWA SCITT follow the School Direct programme as outlined below.\r\n\r\nThe School Direct 11-16 course is aimed at developing the professional skills, knowledge and understanding necessary to become an outstanding reflective practitioner who can provide creative, challenging and purposeful teaching.  Embedded in a school from the beginning of the course you will receive training on one day a week, enabling you to make immediate links between taught sessions and school experience. These are delivered by outstanding current practitioners, with the support of experienced and specially trained school mentors. The course is active and demanding, including simulations of classroom activities, group sessions and sharing developments in pedagogy. \r\n\r\nThe course is supported by the expertise of Roehampton University who provide teaching and academic support for a PGCE (M), library access and taught sessions by subject tutors. Written assignments give you the opportunity to explore the most recent developments into teaching and learning and to research an aspect of your practice in school. \r\n\r\nOn the course you will learn how pupils develop mathematical understanding, knowledge and skills. University tutors and mentors in school will help you to develop a teaching style that enables your pupils to learn mathematics effectively and confidently. You will develop your own skills in the use of ICT and become familiar with the software that can be used to enhance mathematical teaching. A wide range of mathematical resources will be available in the Mathematics Centre to inform your studies.\r\n","interviewProcess":"A rigorous selection and interview process is undertaken so that only candidates with excellent subject knowledge and aptitude for teaching enter the programme.
