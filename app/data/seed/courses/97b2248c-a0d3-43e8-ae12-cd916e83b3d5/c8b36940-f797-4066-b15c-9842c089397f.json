It is specifically designed to utilise your academic expertise to the benefit of pupils, schools and universities. RIS is a three year programme, for details please refer to the RIS website: https://researchersinschools.org/\r\n\r\nIn the first year all RIS participants complete Initial Teacher Training to gain Qualified Teacher status.

These are delivered by outstanding current practitioners, with the support of experienced and specially trained school mentors.
