It is specifically designed to utilise your academic expertise to the benefit of pupils, schools and universities. RIS is a three year programme, for details please refer to the RIS website: https://researchersinschools.org/\r\n\r\nIn the first year all RIS participants complete Initial Teacher Training to gain Qualified Teacher status.

Embedded in a school from the beginning of the course you will receive training on one day a week, enabling you to make immediate links between taught sessions and school experience. These are delivered by outstanding current practitioners, with the support of experienced and specially trained school mentors. The course is active and demanding, including simulations of classroom activities, group sessions and sharing developments in pedagogy. \r\n\r\nThe course is supported by the expertise of Roehampton University who provide teaching and academic support for a PGCE (M), library access and taught sessions by subject tutors. Written assignments give you the opportunity to explore the most recent developments into teaching and learning and to research an aspect of your practice in school. \r\n\r\nThe course will prepare you to teach all aspects of English in secondary schools. By the end of the course you will have learnt how to develop and extend your pupils’ language competence in all its forms, how to organise, structure and assess work for a range of abilities and ages, how to meet the needs of individual learners and how to implement strategies promoting equal opportunities.
