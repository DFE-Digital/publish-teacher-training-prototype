Embedded in a school from the beginning of the course, you will receive training on one day a week, enabling you to make immediate links between taught sessions and school experience. These are delivered by outstanding current practitioners with the support of experienced and specially trained school mentors. The course is active and demanding, including simulations of classroom activities, group sessions and exploring the latest research in pedagogy.  Trainees might have the opportunity take up a teaching post in the placement school following graduation but this is not guaranteed.  \r\n\r\nThe course is supported by the expertise of Roehampton University who provide teaching and academic support for a PGCE (M), library access and taught sessions by subject tutors. Written assignments give you the opportunity to explore the most recent developments into teaching and learning and to research an aspect of your practice in school.\r\n\r\n It is anticipated that you will bring to the course some level of expertise in certain areas of the Computing curriculum, but that you will require support with others.  This support will be provided by course tutors and school-based mentors. However, it is essential that you identify your own specific needs in terms of the areas to develop. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the primary focus of the course, which is to equip you with skills, knowledge and understanding to teach Computing for the 11-16 curriculum, you will have access to a post 16 curriculum, an experience at primary school and a second placement in a contrasting school. By the end of the course you will have learnt how to develop and extend your pupils’ competence in all its forms, how to organise, structure and assess work for a range of abilities and ages, how to meet the needs of individual learners and how to implement strategies promoting equal opportunities. You will learn about current developments in the teaching of Computing.\r\n","interviewProcess":"A rigorous selection and interview process is undertaken so that only candidates with excellent subject knowledge and aptitude for teaching enter the programme.
