Our SCITT programme was awarded ‘Outstanding’ by Ofsted and ranked as the third best provider in the country (top in London) in The Good Teacher Training Guide 2017. We believe in the primacy of knowledge and that teacher-led, school based education can transform lives. Our trainee teachers learn to see themselves as the leaders of their pupils, as custodians of the best that has been thought, known, and created, and as a catalyst for innovation and transformation through the valuable knowledge and skills they will impart to those they teach. \r\n\r\nWe believe that as a student teacher you should be immersed in your host schools for the majority of the time so that you can benefit from the support and guidance of subject experts. Here you will benefit from a mentor who will observe your weekly progress against the Teachers’ Standards. You will also receive half a day of training in term time for training. \r\n","interviewProcess":"Interviews will be conducted by telephone conferencing. This will usually be with two members of the SCITT team, and you will be sent a link to this meeting on the day. \r\n\r\nPre-interview Tasks \r\n\r\nYou will be asked to complete a series of tasks before the interview and send to us by email before the interview.

There will also be the opportunity to ask us any questions you may have. \r\n\r\nSubject-Knowledge Task \r\n\r\nAfter the interview we will ask you to complete a subject-knowledge task.

We believe the most effective way to experience all aspects of school life is to be based in a host school throughout the year. To supplement this, trainee teachers will also participate in three focused placements. Trainee teachers do a three week placement in the second term, which will offer them a contrasting experience within our network of excellent schools. This network includes many independent, grammar and specialist schools. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, trainee teachers will also benefit from a week’s placement in a primary (for secondary trainees), or a secondary (for primary trainees). They will also gain experience within the Tri Borough Alternative Provision. \r\n","personalQualities":"We also assess applicants against the following qualities in their preliminary applications and interviews: \r\n- A strong academic record and passion for your subject \r\n- Strong communication and leadership skills.\r\n- The enthusiasm required to work with the children\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"In addition to the required qualifications above, before the start of the course, you will need to:\r\n\r\n•\tHave undergone an Enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service Check\r\n•\tHave undergone an occupational health assessment to assess fitness for teaching.\r\n","status":2,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:49:34.385Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2023"}
