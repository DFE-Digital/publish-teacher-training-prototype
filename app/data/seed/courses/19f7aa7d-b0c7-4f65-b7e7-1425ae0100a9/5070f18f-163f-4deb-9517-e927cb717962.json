To supplement this, trainee teachers will also participate in three focused placements. Trainee teachers do a three week placement in the second term, which will offer them a contrasting experience within our network of excellent schools. This network includes many independent, grammar and specialist schools. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, trainee teachers will also benefit from a week’s placement in a primary (for secondary trainees), or a secondary (for primary trainees). They will also gain experience within the Tri Borough Alternative Provision. \r\n","personalQualities":"We also assess applicants against the following qualities in their preliminary applications and interviews: \r\n- A strong academic record and passion for your subject \r\n- Strong communication and leadership skills.\r\n- The enthusiasm required to work with the children\r\n\r\nApplicants also need experience gained from working in the classroom.","otherRequirements":"In addition to the required qualifications above, before the start of the course, you will need to:\r\n\r\n•\tHave undergone an Enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service Check\r\n•\tHave undergone an occupational health assessment to assess fitness for teaching.\r\n","status":2,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:49:34.721Z","canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","cycle":"2023"}
