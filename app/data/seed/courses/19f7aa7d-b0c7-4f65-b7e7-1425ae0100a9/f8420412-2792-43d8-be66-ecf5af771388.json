Our SCITT programme was awarded ‘Outstanding’ by Ofsted and ranked as the third best provider in the country (top in London) in The Good Teacher Training Guide 2017. We believe in the primacy of knowledge and that teacher-led, school based education can transform lives. Our trainee teachers learn to see themselves as the leaders of their pupils, as custodians of the best that has been thought, known, and created, and as a catalyst for innovation and transformation through the valuable knowledge and skills they will impart to those they teach.\r\n\r\nWe believe that as a student teacher you should be immersed in your host schools for the majority of the time so that you can benefit from the support and guidance of subject experts. Here you will benefit from a mentor who will observe your weekly progress against the Teachers’ Standards. You will also receive half a day of training in term time for training. \r\n","interviewProcess":"","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Pimlico London SCITT is part of Future Academies, a family of schools which has built a reputation for achieving the highest standards for all its pupils. We believe the most effective way to experience all aspects of school life is to be based in a host school throughout the year. To supplement this, trainee teachers will also participate in three focused placements. Trainee teachers do a three week placement in the second term, which will offer them a contrasting experience within our network of excellent schools. This network includes many independent, grammar and specialist schools. Furthermore, trainee teachers will also benefit from a week’s placement in a primary (for secondary trainees), or a secondary (for primary trainees). They will also gain experience within the Tri Borough Alternative Provision.","personalQualities":"We are looking for highly-qualified and talented graduates.
