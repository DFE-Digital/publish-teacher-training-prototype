It is an incentive to help recruitment. DfE normally pay higher bursaries for high priority subjects where they are concerned that recruitment nationally may not meet their target. For some subjects, no bursary at all is available. You can see the levels of any bursary available for this subject, above. Bursaries are not means tested. Scholarships are also available as an alternative.\r\n\r\nEligibility for student loans normally relates to your residency status.  You can take out a student loan even if you already have an undergraduate loan. Loans for tuition fees are not normally means tested (whereas loans for maintenance are means tested).  You should confirm all this using the links above. \r\n\r\nWhile not provided directly by WLTTA, please be aware that as a full time student you would be eligible for cheaper travel in London using a student Oyster Card and in many boroughs you can get a reduction on your council tax payments.\r\n","aboutCourse":"QUALIFICATION \r\n \r\nThis course E280 with a SEN school, leads to PGCE (M)QTS.  The significance of the qualifications can be found [here.](https://www.wltta.org.uk/initial-teacher-training/secondary-courses-for-sept-2022/different-qualification-outcomes/)\r\n\r\nSPECIAL FEATURES\r\n\r\nThis course is run by the West London Teacher Training Alliance (WLTTA) in partnership with St Mary’s University, Twickenham.  We make prompt shortlisting decisions and will liaise with you quickly if we need additional information.\r\n\r\nWLTTA enables you to choose your host school.  Later, if there is a teaching vacancy and they want to retain you, you can be employed for the following year without the post being advertised.  By becoming a WLTTA trainee, all our schools could employ you this way and we operate a pool.\r\n\r\nOur aim is to produce exceptional teachers who could remain in alliance schools to continue their careers, taking advantage of further professional development, including the accredited Early Career induction programme.\r\n\r\nTHE TRAINING\r\n\r\nYou would enrol at the university and would:\r\n\r\n* attend all the same university sessions with those who had applied through the university; \r\n* have full access to university facilities and mentors.\r\n\r\nThe university awards your PGCE.  WLTTA selects a second contrasting school for your ‘away’ placement.  \r\n\r\nAs a guide: [Typical timetable](https://www.wltta.org.uk/initial-teacher-training/roehamp-sec-unsal-typical-timetable/) \r\n\r\nThe programme includes lectures, workshops, tutorials, and classroom experience, proving you with an awareness of the theoretical foundations of the subject, and of strategies for teaching and learning. \r\n\r\nWorkshops enable you to explore drawing, painting, printmaking, sculpture, textiles, photography and digital art. Regular university tutorials enable you to receive individual support. Lecturers on the programme are experienced teachers of art and design and active researchers in the field of art and design education, while visiting artists offer workshops in specific processes.\r\n\r\nThrough an initial programme of observations, you will become familiar with the workings of the school and department (pupil groups, pastoral systems, staffing, curriculum, resources, facilities, methods of teaching, lesson planning, and assessment).  \r\n\r\nYou will be treated like a member of staff.  With your mentors, you will feel supported as you become ready to teach. Our mentors are excellent experienced teachers who undertake rigorous training to develop mentoring skills.  \r\n\r\nYour university tutor visits you in both schools to monitor your progress and discuss your development with you and your school mentors.\r\n\r\nYou will have the opportunity to teach KS3-5 including digital literacy, computer science/info technology;  use of algorithms in computer programs; developing students’ knowledge of current/emerging technologies; theory of computation;  data and computer systems. ","interviewProcess":"Our schools seek trainees that aspire to work for them. We enable you to select your preferred host school(s) at application and later through a referral process.  We provide information about the schools to help you choose.  \r\n\r\nEach of our schools interview independently, but the process is administered centrally through WLTTA.  You may be asked in advance to complete online tests in numeracy and literacy; and a subject audit questionnaire.  \r\n\r\nPlease email scans of your degree and Maths/English qualifications to WLTTA centrally (Alex Dijkhuis) \r\n[adijkhuis@sacredh.lbhf.sch.uk](adijkhuis@sacredh.lbhf.sch.uk).  We can still make an offer subject to later verification of particular qualifications.\r\n\r\nINTERNAL REFERRALS\r\nIf you do not get an offer after the school interview but have demonstrated potential, you can then choose another school and we would recommend your shortlisting.  You would not need to repeat the online tests or subject audit.\r\n\r\nWe hope to fit good candidates with schools that they are happy with and where they can secure an offer.\r\n\r\nThere remains an advantage initially in applying to the course at more than one school, because such applications would be considered in parallel rather than sequentially. If you have a clear first choice, email us and we can try to ensure a sensible order for the interviews.  \r\n\r\nAPPLICATIONS\r\n\r\nThe new application process (button at end) is intuitive, but we have made a short guide to how it works: [How application system works](https://www.wltta.org.uk/initial-teacher-training/secondary-courses-for-sept-2022/how-application-system-works/). ","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"CHOOSING YOUR SCHOOL\r\n\r\nWith WLTTA, you select the main host school at application and normally there are several to choose from but we are only running this particular course (which specifies a SEN host school) from \r\n\r\n* The Rise School, TW13.\r\n\r\nWe then later arrange your second placement at another contrasting (mainstream) WLTTA school to provide greater depth to your training experience. \r\n\r\nIf you want to see when you would be at the university; when at your main host school; and when the contrasting school - see our typical timetable linked above.\r\n\r\nYou can read a description of The Rise and our other secondary schools in our overall [WLTTA Secondary School Summary Descriptions](https://www.wltta.org.uk/initial-teacher-training/secondary-courses-for-sept-2022/wltta-secondary-school-summary-descriptions/). Please also refer to our [Map of WLTTA Schools](https://www.wltta.org.uk/location-map-with-magnifier/)\r\n\r\nYou can always contact us to ask how many applications (if any) are being considered by different schools at the point that you are about to apply.\r\n\r\nOUR DETAILED WEBSITE, LIVE ONLINE PRESENTATION AND Q&A\r\n\r\nWe recommend that you visit our website [www.wltta.org.uk](https://www.wltta.org.uk/) to properly see all our vacancies, for example we have another separate Art & Design teacher-training course with a variety of mainstream schools.  You can download the course document for any of our courses and see a video about us, with previous trainees being interviewed.  \r\n\r\nIf you want to, you can also sign up there to join our fortnightly 'live' Zoom presentation about getting into teaching and it includes an opportunity for Q&A . The presentation explains all about the different routes into teaching and their separate benefits; how the money works; tips about using the 'Find Postgraduate Teacher Training' portal; applications; offers; etc.  No pressure, you don't have to attend this at all.  It's just there for anyone who is trying to understand it all better.  We get excellent feedback on this year after year.","personalQualities":"We seek trainees with a passion to engage and inspire students to a love of learning, who are:   \r\n\r\n* committed to championing their students;\r\n* open to learning about children’s physical/social/emotional/cognitive needs and how these can affect behaviour;\r\n* in good health with the ability to cope with stress.  Teaching is incredibly rewarding, but it also requires an element of resilience!\r\n* professional/committed to equal opportunities;\r\n* able to communicate well in written/spoken English, with at least basic computer skills and commitment to developing these; and with\r\n\r\nIt helps to have a sense of humour/ability to laugh at yourself!","otherRequirements":"Some previous experience with SEN children would be a distinct advantage.\r\n\r\nA realistic understanding of the role of a teacher and an awareness of some current issues facing the profession is also important.  We have some advice relating to school experience on our website: [WLTTA School Experience tab](https://www.wltta.org.uk/initial-teacher-training/secondary-courses-for-sept-2022/school-experience/)\r\n\r\nOffers are conditional on satisfactory outcome of a DBS check (approx. £60) and an occupational health check (approx. £20) both administered through the university after an offer is accepted.
