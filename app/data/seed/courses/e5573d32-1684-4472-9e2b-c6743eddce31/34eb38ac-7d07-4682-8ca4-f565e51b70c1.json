We make prompt shortlisting decisions and will liaise with you quickly if we need additional information.\r\n\r\nWLTTA enables you to choose your host school.  Later, if there is a teaching vacancy and they want to retain you, you can be employed for the following year without the post being advertised.  By becoming a WLTTA trainee, all our schools could employ you this way and we operate a pool.\r\n\r\nOur aim is to produce exceptional teachers who could remain in alliance schools to continue their careers, taking advantage of further professional development, including the accredited Early Career induction programme.\r\n\r\nTHE TRAINING\r\n\r\nYou would enrol at the university and would attend the same university sessions with those who had applied through the university; have full access to university facilities and mentors; and the university still awards your PGCE.  WLTTA selects a second contrasting school for your ‘away’ placement.  \r\n\r\nAs a guide: [typical timetable](https://www.wltta.org.uk/initial-teacher-training/ucl-sec-psych-soc-sci-typical-timetable/)\r\n\r\nThis programme prepares students to teach psychology in a flexible and exciting way.\r\n\r\nUCL draws on current research to inform a student's psychology and social science teaching, encouraging them to engage with recent debates, literature and policy in the field. Our underlying aim is to develop students as reflective and highly skilled teachers.\r\n\r\nThe programme is delivered via keynote lectures, subject lectures, seminars, workshops, tutorials and directed study days at the university, together with time in school.\r\n\r\nAt school, through an initial programme of observations, you will become familiar with the workings of the school and department (pupil groups, pastoral systems, staffing, curriculum, resources, facilities, methods of teaching, lesson planning, and assessment).  \r\n\r\nYou will be treated like a member of teaching staff and with your school mentors, you will feel supported as you become ready to teach. Our mentors are excellent experienced teachers who undertake rigorous training to develop their mentoring skills.  \r\n\r\nThroughout your time in both schools, your university tutor will visit you on a regular basis and liaise with your school mentor regarding your training and development. Your university tutor will carry out your final assessment in school against the national Teachers’ Standards.  ","interviewProcess":"Our schools seek trainees that aspire to work for them. We enable you to select your preferred host school(s) at application and later through a referral process.  We provide information about the schools to help you choose.  \r\n\r\nSTAGE 1: SCHOOL INTERVIEW\r\n\r\nOnce shortlisted, we would invite you to an interview with your chosen school.  In addition to the panel interview, you may be asked to prepare something to teach in the classroom for a short time.  You may also be asked to complete a short literacy/numeracy test.\r\n\r\nInternal Referrals\r\n\r\nIf you are not selected as a preferred candidate by the school, but have demonstrated potential, you can then choose another school of ours and we would recommend you for shortlisting.  We hope to fit good candidates with schools that they are happy with and where they can secure an offer.\r\n\r\nThere remains an advantage however in initially applying for a place at more than one of our schools, because such applications would be considered in parallel rather than sequentially. \r\n\r\nSTAGE 2: UNIVERSITY INTERVIEW \r\n\r\nIf you are identified as the preferred candidate from the school interview, we then arrange for you to be invited to the Stage 2 university interview. If you pass this, we will be able to make you an offer.\r\n\r\nAPPLICATIONS\r\n\r\nThe new application process (button at end) is intuitive, but we have made a short guide to how it works: [How application system works](https://www.wltta.org.uk/initial-teacher-training/secondary-courses-for-sept-2022/how-application-system-works/). ","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"CHOOSING YOUR SCHOOL\r\n\r\nWith WLTTA, you select the main host school at application.  We then later arrange your second placement at another contrasting WLTTA school to provide greater depth to your training experience. \r\n\r\nIf you want to see when you would be at the university; when at your main host school; and when the contrasting school - see our typical timetable linked above.\r\n\r\nThe schools seeking trainees on this particular course are listed below. \r\n\r\n* St Richard Reynolds Catholic College, TW1\r\n* William Morris Sixth Form, W6\r\n\r\nThe characters and location of our schools are varied.
