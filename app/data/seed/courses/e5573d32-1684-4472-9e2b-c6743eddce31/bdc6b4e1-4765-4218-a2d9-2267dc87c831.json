The significance of the qualifications can be found [here.](https://www.wltta.org.uk/initial-teacher-training/secondary-courses-for-sept-2022/different-qualification-outcomes/)\r\n\r\nSPECIAL FEATURES\r\n\r\nThis course is run by the West London Teacher Training Alliance (WLTTA) in partnership with St Mary’s University, Twickenham.  We make prompt shortlisting decisions and will liaise with you quickly if we need additional information.\r\n\r\nWLTTA enables you to choose your host school.  Later, if there is a teaching vacancy and they want to retain you, you can be employed for the following year without the post being advertised.  By becoming a WLTTA trainee, all our schools could employ you this way and we operate a pool.\r\n\r\nOur aim is to produce exceptional teachers who could remain in alliance schools to continue their careers, taking advantage of further professional development, including the accredited Early Career induction programme.\r\n\r\nTHE TRAINING\r\n\r\nYou would enrol at the university and would:\r\n\r\n* attend all the same university sessions with those who had applied through the university; \r\n* have full access to university facilities and mentors.\r\n\r\nThe university awards your PGCE.  WLTTA selects a second contrasting school for your ‘away’ placement.  \r\n\r\nAs a guide: [Typical timetable](https://www.wltta.org.uk/initial-teacher-training/roehamp-sec-unsal-typical-timetable/) \r\n\r\nThe programme includes lectures, workshops, tutorials, and classroom experience, proving you with an awareness of the theoretical foundations of the subject, and of strategies for teaching and learning. \r\n\r\nThrough an initial programme of observations, you will become familiar with the workings of the school and department (pupil groups, pastoral systems, staffing, curriculum, resources, facilities, methods of teaching, lesson planning, and assessment).  \r\n\r\nYou will be treated like a member of teaching staff and with your school mentors, you will feel supported as you become ready to teach. Our mentors are excellent experienced teachers who undertake rigorous training to develop their mentoring skills.  \r\n\r\nYour university tutor visits you in both schools to monitor your progress and discuss your development with you and your school mentors.\r\n\r\nYou will have the opportunity to teach KS3-5 including digital literacy, computer science/info technology; algorithms in computer programs; current and emerging technologies; the theory of computation;  fundamentals of data and computer systems. ","interviewProcess":"Our schools seek trainees that aspire to work for them. We enable you to select your preferred host school(s) at application and later through a referral process.  We provide information about the schools to help you choose.  \r\n\r\nEach of our schools interview independently, but the process is administered centrally through WLTTA.  You may be asked in advance to complete online tests in numeracy and literacy; and a subject audit questionnaire.  \r\n\r\nPlease email scans of your degree and Maths/English qualifications to WLTTA centrally (Alex Dijkhuis) \r\n[adijkhuis@sacredh.lbhf.sch.uk](adijkhuis@sacredh.lbhf.sch.uk).  We can still make an offer subject to later verification of particular qualifications.\r\n\r\nINTERNAL REFERRALS\r\nIf you do not get an offer after the school interview but have demonstrated potential, you can then choose another school and we would recommend your shortlisting.  You would not need to repeat the online tests or subject audit.\r\n\r\nWe hope to fit good candidates with schools that they are happy with and where they can secure an offer.\r\n\r\nThere remains an advantage initially in applying to the course at more than one school, because such applications would be considered in parallel rather than sequentially. If you have a clear first choice, email us and we can try to ensure a sensible order for the interviews.  \r\n\r\nAPPLICATIONS\r\n\r\nThe new application process (button at end) is intuitive, but we have made a short guide to how it works: [How application system works](https://www.wltta.org.uk/initial-teacher-training/secondary-courses-for-sept-2022/how-application-system-works/). ","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"CHOOSING YOUR SCHOOL\r\n\r\nWith WLTTA, you select the main host school at application.  We then later arrange your second placement at another contrasting WLTTA school to provide greater depth to your training experience. \r\n\r\nIf you want to see when you would be at the university; when at your main host school; and when the contrasting school - see our typical timetable linked above.\r\n\r\nThe schools seeking trainees on this particular course are listed below. \r\n\r\n* Chelsea Academy, SW10\r\n* Drayton Manor High School, W7\r\n* Gumley House School, TW7\r\n* Queens Park Community School, NW6\r\n* Sacred Heart High School, W6\r\n* The Fulham Boys’ School, SW6\r\n\r\nThe characters and location of our schools are varied.

You can download the course document for any of our courses and see a video about us, with previous trainees being interviewed.  \r\n\r\nIf you want to, you can also sign up there to join our fortnightly 'live' Zoom presentation about getting into teaching and it includes an opportunity for Q&A . The presentation explains all about the different routes into teaching and their separate benefits; how the money works; tips about using the 'Find Postgraduate Teacher Training' portal; applications; offers; etc.  No pressure, you don't have to attend this at all.  It's just there for anyone who is trying to understand it all better.  We get excellent feedback on this year after year.","personalQualities":"We seek trainees with a passion to engage and inspire students to a love of learning, who are:   \r\n\r\n* committed to championing their students;\r\n* open to learning about children’s physical/social/emotional/cognitive needs and how these can affect behaviour;\r\n* in good health with the ability to cope with stress.
