We make prompt shortlisting decisions and will liaise with you quickly if we need additional information.\r\n\r\nWLTTA enables you to choose your host school.  Later, if there is a teaching vacancy and they want to retain you, you can be employed for the following year without the post being advertised.  By becoming a WLTTA trainee, all our schools could employ you this way and we operate a pool.\r\n\r\nOur aim is to produce exceptional teachers who could remain in alliance schools to continue their careers, taking advantage of further professional development, including the accredited Early Career induction programme.\r\n\r\nTHE TRAINING\r\n\r\nYou would enrol at the university and would attend the same university sessions with those who had applied through the university; have full access to university facilities and mentors; and the university still awards your PGCE.  WLTTA selects a second contrasting school for your ‘away’ placement.  \r\n\r\nAs a guide: [typical timetable](https://www.wltta.org.uk/initial-teacher-training/ucl-bus-cit-typical-timetable/)\r\n\r\nThe Business Education PGCE prepares you to teach across the 14–19 age range, helping you develop the professional skills and attitudes to teach business in schools and colleges, as part of both academic (A level and GCSE) and BTEC courses.  You would attend a range of lectures and workshops with other secondary teacher trainees, including those relating to teaching and assessing, classroom management, child protection.  \r\n\r\nAt school, through an initial programme of observations, you will become familiar with the workings of the school and department (pupil groups, pastoral systems, staffing, curriculum, resources, facilities, methods of teaching, lesson planning, and assessment).  \r\n\r\nYou will be treated like a member of staff and with your school mentors, you will feel supported as you become ready to teach. Our mentors are excellent experienced teachers who undertake rigorous training to develop their mentoring skills.\r\n\r\nYour university tutor will visit you in both schools on a regular basis and liaise with your school mentor regarding your training and development. Your university tutor will carry out your final assessment in school against the national Teachers’ Standards.  \r\n\r\nYou will have the opportunity to teach both KS4 (GCSE) and KS5 and take an active part in extracurricular activities such as organising business trips. Examples of KS4 topics include effective financial management, putting a business idea into practice and marketing.","interviewProcess":"Our schools seek trainees that aspire to work for them. We enable you to select your preferred host school(s) at application and later through a referral process.  We provide information about the schools to help you choose.  \r\n\r\nSTAGE 1: SCHOOL INTERVIEW\r\n\r\nOnce shortlisted, we would invite you to an interview with your chosen school.  In addition to the panel interview, you may be asked to prepare something to teach in the classroom for a short time.  You may also be asked to complete a short literacy/numeracy test.\r\n\r\nInternal Referrals\r\n\r\nIf you are not selected as a preferred candidate by the school, but have demonstrated potential, you can then choose another school of ours and we would recommend you for shortlisting.  We hope to fit good candidates with schools that they are happy with and where they can secure an offer.\r\n\r\nThere remains an advantage however in initially applying for a place at more than one of our schools, because such applications would be considered in parallel rather than sequentially. \r\n\r\nSTAGE 2: UNIVERSITY INTERVIEW \r\n\r\nIf you are identified as the preferred candidate from the school interview, we then arrange for you to be invited to the Stage 2 university interview. If you pass this, we will be able to make you an offer.\r\n\r\nAPPLICATIONS\r\n\r\nThe new application process (button at end) is intuitive, but we have made a short guide to how it works: [How application system works](https://www.wltta.org.uk/initial-teacher-training/secondary-courses-for-sept-2022/how-application-system-works/). ","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"CHOOSING YOUR SCHOOL\r\n\r\nWith WLTTA, you select the main host school at application.  We then later arrange your second placement at another contrasting WLTTA school to provide greater depth to your training experience. \r\n\r\nIf you want to see when you would be at the university; when at your main host school; and when the contrasting school - see our typical timetable linked above.\r\n\r\nThe schools seeking trainees on this particular course are listed below. \r\n\r\n* Drayton Manor High School, W7\r\n* Queens Park Community School, NW6\r\n* Sacred Heart High School, W6 (keen on those who also have an interest in economics)\r\n* St Richard Reynolds TW1\r\n\r\nThe characters and location of our schools are varied.
