Further clarity on the significance of different teacher training qualifications can be found [here](http://www.wltsa.org.uk/initial-teacher-training/secondary-courses/different-qualification-outcomes/).\r\n\r\nSPECIAL FEATURES\r\nThis course is run by the West London Teaching School Alliance (WLTSA) as Provider in partnership with (and accredited by) St Mary’s University, Twickenham.  \r\n\r\nWLTSA enables you to choose your host school at application.  Later, if there is a vacancy in your host school and they want to retain you, you can be employed fairly seamlessly for the following year without the post being advertised.  By becoming a WLTSA trainee, all our other secondary schools could also employ you this way and we operate a pool.\r\n\r\nOur aim is to produce exceptional teachers who can then remain in alliance schools, continuing to further their career with the benefit of our on-going CPD.\r\n\r\nTHE TRAINING\r\n\r\nMost schools need you to be able to teach at least one of the three sciences to A-Level, and to be willing and able to teach all three Sciences at Key Stage 3 and ideally to GCSE.  We can help you learn to do so. \r\n\r\nYour training will be predominantly based in your host (employing) school other than\r\n\r\n*approx. 10 days at the university across the year; and\r\n*your second placement for approx. 6 weeks at another WLTSA school.  \r\n\r\nYou will register with the university and meet with your University Tutor who will begin to work with you on a needs analysis for a Training Plan. This will be reworked in term two and three between you, your school mentor and university tutor. \r\n\r\nThrough an initial programme of observations, you will become familiar with the workings of the school and department (pupil groups, pastoral systems, staffing, curriculum, resources, facilities, methods of teaching, lesson planning, and assessment).  \r\n\r\nYou will be treated like a member of staff and with your school mentors, you will feel supported as you become ready to teach. Our mentors are excellent experienced teachers who undertake rigorous training to develop their mentoring skills.  \r\n\r\nThroughout your time in both schools, your university tutor visits you to monitor your progress and discuss your development with you and your school mentors. You will maintain close links with your host school throughout the programme.\r\n\r\nYou will have the opportunity to teach across KS3/KS4 and to support KS5. KS3 topics include elements and chemical reactions, cell biology, nutrition and digestion, atoms, energy and forces.   \r\n","interviewProcess":"The interview process for this course may change as the year progresses depending on the Covid situation.\r\nPrior to Covid, we had a two-stage process with one initial interview at the university, and then an interview at your chosen host school a couple of days later. The school interview included an opportunity for you to join a class to either assist or to teach something for a short time.\r\nWe have now moved to a new system where there is one online interview with school and the outcome is then reviewed and approved by the university. We anticipate that this new system will persist certainly throughout the autumn term, and possibly for the remainder of the year.\r\n\r\nThose shortlisted by WLTSA will be emailed by the school with technical arrangements for the interview.\r\nYou will also be asked by WLTSA centrally to email us with scans of your relevant qualification certificates and transcripts if you already have them (see course requirements later below).\r\nWe try to ensure that you have at least a week's notice of the interview.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"With WLTSA you select the main host school at application and normally there are several to choose from but we are only running this particular salaried course at West London Free School, W6.  We then later arrange your second placement at a contrasting WLTSA school to provide greater depth to your training experience. \r\n\r\nYou can read a description of West London Free School and our other secondary schools in our overall [WLTSA Secondary School Summary Descriptions](http://www.wltsa.org.uk/initial-teacher-training/secondary-courses/wltsa-secondary-school-summary-descriptions/).    Our [Map of WLTSA Schools](http://www.wltsa.org.uk/map-of-all-wltsa-schools/) may also be helpful.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that we have other [WLTSA secondary courses](http://www.wltsa.org.uk/initial-teacher-training/secondary-courses/) at other schools including an unsalaried Biology course 2XVC and another unsalaried Biology course VM7T to be run in a special needs school. Both of the unsalaried courses come with access to a DfE bursary.\r\n\r\nYou can make three choices overall when you apply.\r\n\r\nTHE TECHNICAL BIT!\r\n\r\nYou don’t have to restrict yourself to one school within a course, but each school would count as one application and you get three choices overall in Round 1.  Please also be aware that we have so many partner schools that we have been forced to split artificially on UCAS into three provider names.  See [How to apply & how to choose more than one school on a course.](http://www.wltsa.org.uk/initial-teacher-training/secondary-courses/how-to-apply-how-to-choose-more-than-1-school-on-a-course/)\r\n\r\nBE STRATEGIC WHEN YOU APPLY\r\n\r\nYou can always ring us up to ask how many applications (if any) are being considered by different schools at the point that you are about to apply.  We also keep our website up to date so that you can see which schools have already shortlisted and are interviewing. \r\n\r\nWe commonly interview individually whenever a good application is received. \r\n","personalQualities":"We want you to have passion and enthusiasm.  We need trainees who can engage and inspire students to a love of learning, who are:   \r\n*committed to championing their students;\r\n*open to learn about children’s physical/social/emotional/cognitive needs and how these can affect behaviour;\r\n*in good health with the ability to cope with stress.  Teaching is incredibly rewarding, but it also requires an element of resilience!\r\n*professional and committed to equal opportunities;\r\n*able to communicate well in written/spoken English, with at least basic computer skills and commitment to developing these.\r\n*have a sense of humour and an ability to laugh at yourself.     \r\n","otherRequirements":"We will look for a level of maturity (irrespective of age) to operate as a responsible salaried member of staff.  \r\n\r\nA realistic understanding of the role of a teacher and some current issues facing the profession is also important.   It can help to spend a couple of days observing relevant lessons in a state secondary school to strengthen your application but this observation is not a strict requirement in itself.  [Top tips for getting some observational experience](http://www.wltsa.org.uk/initial-teacher-training/secondary-courses/school-experience/).\r\n\r\nOffers are conditional on satisfactory outcome of DBS and occupational health checks  both administered through the school after an offer is accepted.   \r\n","status":2,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:53:47.984Z","canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","cycle":"2024","salaryDetails":"The successful candidate in any maintained school will be paid a salary by the employing host school in line with the ‘Non-Qualified Teacher Pay Range 2020-21’, normally at the Point 1 level.  This government pay range is expected to be published in Sept. 2020.\r\n\r\nAs a guide, Point 1 on the Unqualified Teacher Pay Range for 2020-21 is:\r\n\r\n* £22,849 (for a school in Inner London)\r\n* £21,582 (for a school in outer London)\r\n\r\nOne exception to this is Free Schools who set their own trainee salary levels, usually at a similar level.\r\n\r\nThe tuition fee for this course will be covered by WLTSA.\r\n\r\nTrainees on salaried programmes are not eligible for bursaries or student loans. \r\n\r\nPlease note that we are unable to sponsor anyone who would otherwise not have the right to take up employment in this country.
