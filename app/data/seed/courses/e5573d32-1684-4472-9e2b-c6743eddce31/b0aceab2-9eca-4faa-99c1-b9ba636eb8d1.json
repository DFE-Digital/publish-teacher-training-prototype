The significance of the qualifications can be found [here.](https://wltta.msoclientsites.co.uk/initial-teacher-training/secondary-courses-for-sept-2022/different-qualification-outcomes/)\r\n\r\nSPECIAL FEATURES\r\n\r\nThis course is run by the West London Teacher Training Alliance (WLTTA) in partnership with St Mary’s University, Twickenham.  We make prompt shortlisting decisions and will liaise with you quickly if we need additional information.\r\n\r\nWLTTA enables you to choose your host school.  Later, if there is a teaching vacancy and they want to retain you, you can be employed for the following year without the post being advertised.  By becoming a WLTTA trainee, all our schools could employ you this way and we operate a pool.\r\n\r\nOur aim is to produce exceptional teachers who could remain in alliance schools to continue their careers, taking advantage of further professional development, including the accredited Early Career induction programme.\r\n\r\nTHE TRAINING\r\n\r\nYou would enrol at the university and:\r\n\r\n* attend all the same university sessions with those who had applied through the university; \r\n\r\n* have full access to university facilities and mentors.\r\n\r\nThe university still awards your PGCE.  WLTTA selects a second contrasting school for your ‘away’ placement.  \r\n\r\nAs a guide: [Typical timetable](https://wltta.msoclientsites.co.uk/initial-teacher-training/st-m-unsal-sec-pgce-typical-timetable/) \r\n\r\nLectures would include teaching, assessing, classroom management and child protection.  Subject seminars are led by your university tutor. \r\n\r\nAt school, through an initial programme of observations, you will become familiar with the workings of the school and department (pupil groups, pastoral systems, staffing, curriculum, resources, facilities, methods of teaching, lesson planning, and assessment).  \r\n\r\nYou will be treated like a member of teaching staff and with your school mentors, you will feel supported as you become ready to teach. Our mentors are excellent experienced teachers who undertake rigorous training to develop their mentoring skills.  \r\n\r\nThroughout your time in both schools, your university tutor visits you to monitor your progress and discuss your development with you and your school mentors.\r\n\r\nYou will have the opportunity to teach KS3&KS4 PE.  There may be opportunities for you to support KS5 in either your host or second placement school.\r\n\r\nYou will also be an active part of extracurricular PE - clubs, training/fixtures. KS3 activities taught in different schools vary but football, netball, basketball, dance, gymnastics, badminton, table tennis, fitness, and additional awards such as sports leadership may be covered in KS4. You will be expected to assess ability; evaluate and improve work across a range of activities, as well as develop knowledge of health and fitness.","interviewProcess":"Our schools seek trainees that aspire to work for them. We enable you to select your preferred host school(s) at application and later through a referral process.  We provide information about the schools to help you choose.  \r\n\r\nSTAGE 1: UNIVERSITY INTERVIEW\r\n\r\nOnce shortlisted, we arrange for you to be invited to an online university interview. You will be asked to upload ID documents and relevant certificates/transcripts if available.  We can still make an offer subject to later verification of qualifications.\r\n\r\nThe university may ask you to prepare a brief presentation on a particular topic and a subject audit questionnaire.  This will help them to establish the breadth of your subject knowledge, which they will discuss with you.  ‘Subject Knowledge Enhancement’ courses are sometimes included as an offer condition.\r\n\r\nSTAGE 2: SCHOOL INTERVIEW \r\n\r\nThe school interview follows 3-4 days later and could lead to an offer.\r\n\r\nINTERNAL REFERRALS\r\n\r\nIf you do not get an offer from Stage 2 but have demonstrated potential, you can then choose another school and we would recommend your shortlisting.  The university interview would not be repeated.\r\n\r\nWe hope to fit good candidates with schools that they are happy with and where they can secure an offer.\r\n\r\nThere remains an advantage in applying to the course at more than one school, because such applications would be considered in parallel rather than sequentially. \r\n\r\nAPPLICATIONS\r\n\r\nThe new application process (button at end) is intuitive, but we have made a short guide to how it works: [How application system works](https://wltta.msoclientsites.co.uk/initial-teacher-training/secondary-courses-for-sept-2022/how-application-system-works/). ","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"CHOOSING YOUR SCHOOL\r\n\r\nWith WLTTA, you select the main host school at application.  We then later arrange your second placement at another contrasting WLTTA school to provide greater depth to your training experience. \r\n\r\nIf you want to see when you would be at the university; when at your main host school; and when the contrasting school - see our typical timetable linked above.\r\n\r\nThe schools seeking trainees on this particular course are listed below. \r\n\r\n* Gumley House School TW7\r\n* Hammersmith Academy, W6\r\n* Queens Park Community School, NW6\r\n* Sacred Heart High School, W6\r\n* St Richard Reynolds Catholic College, TW1\r\n* The Fulham Boys' School, SW6\r\n\r\nThe characters and location of our schools are varied.

You can download the course document for any of our courses; and see a video about us, with previous trainees being interviewed.  \r\n\r\nYou can also sign up there to join our fortnightly 'live' Zoom presentation about getting into teaching, with an opportunity for Q&A . The presentation explains all about the different routes into teaching and their separate benefits; how the money works; tips about using the 'Find Postgraduate Teacher Training' portal; applications; offers; etc.  No pressure, you don't have to attend this at all.  It's just there for anyone who is trying to understand it all better.  We get excellent feedback on this.","personalQualities":"We seek trainees with a passion to engage and inspire students to a love of learning, who are:   \r\n\r\n* committed to championing their students;\r\n* open to learning about children’s physical/social/emotional/cognitive needs and how these can affect behaviour;\r\n* in good health with the ability to cope with stress.
