[The significance of different teacher training qualifications](http://www.wltsa.org.uk/initial-teacher-training/secondary-courses/different-qualification-outcomes/).\r\n\r\nThe course is run by the West London Teaching School Alliance (WLTSA) in partnership with and accredited by St Mary’s University.  We make prompt shortlisting decisions and will liaise with you quickly if we need additional information.\r\n\r\nWLTSA enables you to choose your host school.  Later, if there is a teaching vacancy and they want to retain you, you can be employed fairly seamlessly for the following year without the post being advertised.  By becoming a WLTSA trainee, all our other secondary schools could also employ you this way and we operate a pool.\r\n\r\nOur aim is to produce exceptional teachers who can then remain in alliance schools, continuing to further their career with the benefit of our on-going CPD.\r\n\r\nYour training will be predominantly based in your host (employing) school other than\r\n\r\n*approx. 10 days at the university across the year; and\r\n*your second placement for approx. 6 weeks at another WLTSA school.  \r\n\r\nYou will register with the university and meet with your University Tutor who will begin to work with you on a needs analysis for a Training Plan (TP) in term one. This will be reworked in term two and three between you, your school mentor and university tutor. \r\n\r\nAt school, through an initial programme of observations, you will become familiar with the workings of the school and department (pupil groups, pastoral systems, staffing, curriculum, resources, facilities, methods of teaching, lesson planning, and assessment).  \r\n\r\nYou will be treated like a member of the teaching staff and with your school mentors, you will feel supported as you become ready to teach. Our mentors are excellent experienced teachers who undertake rigorous training to develop their mentoring skills.  \r\n\r\nThroughout your time in both schools, your university tutor visits you to monitor your progress and discuss your development with you and your school mentors. You will maintain close links with your host school throughout the programme.\r\n\r\nYou will have the opportunity to teach KS3/KS4 PE, including GCSE.  There may be opportunities for you to support KS5 in either your host or second school.\r\n\r\nYou will also be an active part of the extra-curricular PE provision (sports clubs, training and fixtures).  You will be expected to work collaboratively to assess ability; evaluate and improve work across a range of activities as well as develop knowledge of health and fitness.","interviewProcess":"COVID CHANGES\r\n\r\nThe interview process for this course may change as the year progresses depending on the Covid situation.\r\nPrior to Covid, we had a two-stage process with one initial interview at the university, and then an interview at your chosen host school a couple of days later. The school interview included an opportunity for you to join a class to either assist or to teach something for a short time.\r\n\r\nWe have now moved to a system with one online interview - with the school.  This will persist throughout the autumn term, and possibly for the remainder of the year.\r\n\r\nONLINE INTERVIEW\r\n\r\nThose shortlisted by WLTSA will be emailed by the school with technical interview arrangements.\r\nYou will also be asked by WLTSA to email us with scans of your relevant qualification certificates/transcripts if you already have them (see course requirements later below). \r\n\r\n If you are still taking your degree or GCSE equivalency tests, that’s fine but if you don’t have access to original certificates of exams already taken for your degree and maths and English GCSEs, this is something that you should start to resolve now.  If you don’t have them in time for the interview, please be assured that we can still make an offer to you but it would be subject to later verification of your qualification certificates and sometimes certified copies can take a couple of months to arrive.\r\n\r\nWe try to ensure that you have at least a week’s notice of the interview.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"With WLTSA you select the main host school at application and normally there are several to choose from but we are only running this particular salaried course at West London Free School, W6.  We then later arrange your second placement at a contrasting WLTSA school to provide greater depth to your training experience. \r\n\r\nYou can read a description of West London Free School and our other secondary schools in our overall [WLTSA Secondary School Summary Descriptions](http://www.wltsa.org.uk/initial-teacher-training/secondary-courses/wltsa-secondary-school-summary-descriptions/).    Our [Map of WLTSA Schools](http://www.wltsa.org.uk/map-of-all-wltsa-schools/) may also be helpful.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that we have other [WLTSA secondary courses] (http://www.wltsa.org.uk/initial-teacher-training/secondary-courses/) at other schools including an unsalaried Physical Education course 2Y38. \r\n \r\nYou can make three choices overall when you apply.\r\n\r\nBE STRATEGIC WHEN YOU APPLY\r\n\r\nYou can always ring us up to ask how many applications (if any) are being considered by different schools at the point that you are about to apply.  We also keep our website up to date so that you can see which schools have already shortlisted and are interviewing. \r\n\r\nWe commonly interview individually whenever a good application is received. Early application is recommended.\r\n","personalQualities":"We want you to have passion and enthusiasm.
