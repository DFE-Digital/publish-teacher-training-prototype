Trainees will leave the course with the knowledge of planning, teaching and assessing their pupils. They will be able to implement a range of strategies to manage behaviour in the classroom. They will be able to reflect on their own practice and identify future CPD needs.\r\n\r\nGood practice in school is modelled throughout subject sessions. To this end trainees have opportunities to refresh their memories about the issues in psychology through workshops and seminars where they plan mini lessons, starters and plenaries, and teach and assess each other using the principles of good teaching but in a safe environment. Trainees are then able to take their pedagogical and subject knowledge and apply it to their placement environment.\r\n\r\nVisit our website to find out more: [https://www.worcester.ac.uk/courses/pgce-secondary-psychology](https://www.worcester.ac.uk/courses/pgce-secondary-psychology)  \r\n\r\nAge range:\r\nYou will be trained to teach 14-19 year olds.
