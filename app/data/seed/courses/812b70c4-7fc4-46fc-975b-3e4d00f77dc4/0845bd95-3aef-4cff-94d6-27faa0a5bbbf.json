Should children know how to use a Raspberry Pi? Does learning to program in Python build children's soft skills?\r\n\r\nIf the questions above fill you with curiosity this is the course for you!\r\n\r\nOur one-year Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) prepares you to teach the secondary school computing curriculum for the 11-16 age range. \r\n\r\nYou’ll explore how to teach children computing and digital skills through hands-on activities such as programming and practical projects using Microbits, Raspberry Pi's and robots.\r\n\r\nThe sessions will include looking at recent pedagogy and learning how to teach the theoretical aspects of the subject including binary conversions, algorithms, data structures, and networks. In the sessions you’ll look at how digital safety is taught, and you’ll also consider different aspects of virtual learning for teaching computing in school. \r\n\r\nPeer teaching will allow you to work on GCSE and A-Level theory topics, so that you understand how students will learn in your classroom. Some of the topics you might cover are programming languages or how to assess a pupil’s use of HTML to create a web page. \r\n\r\nYou’ll also have guest lectures from people working in industry, such as representatives from the Computing at School community of practice and exam boards. \r\n\r\nFEATURES AND BENEFITS\r\n\r\nEmployability - You will have the knowledge, skills and experience to teach computing at Key Stage 3, GCSE and potentially A/AS-level.\r\n\r\nSchools experience - You will spend at least the minimum DfE required time in schools (approximately 120 days) on placements in schools, gaining experience in mainstream secondary schools.\r\n\r\nPostgraduate credits - When you graduate, you’ll achieve 60 masters’ level credits (this is one-third of a masters degree). You can put these towards a masters degree to help you develop your new career, such as our new MTeach course.\r\n\r\nPartnerships - We have partnerships with over 1,500 schools, colleges and educational organisations, meaning we are able to provide students with a range of school experiences.\r\n\r\nResearch-led teaching - Our research centre, ESRI ranks in the UK’s top 20 for research power in Education (Research Excellence Framework, 2014) and recent research sponsors include the Department of Education; Wellcome Trust; European Union; Esmée Fairbairn Foundation; Barclays; Microsoft; Siemens and LEGO.","interviewProcess":"You will be expected to attend an online interview as part of the application process. Full details of your interview will be provided by email once your initial application has been approved.\r\n\r\nYour interview will last approximately 30 minutes focusing on your awareness of current secondary science education and your school based experience, and you will have the opportunity to:\r\n\r\n•\tRelate subject content of your education to the role of a secondary school teacher\r\n•\tDiscuss your relevant experience\r\n•\tGive an account of your knowledge of the National Curriculum and what your chosen subject has to offer learners\r\n•\tCommunicate effectively your insights into teaching and learning\r\n•\tShare views about the qualities of a good teacher\r\n•\tDiscuss how you might teach a topic from your chosen subject area\r\n•\tDiscuss principles of inclusion in education","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"\r\nOn this one-year course, you’ll spend a minimum of 120 days on placements in schools.\r\n\r\nWe know that teaching a class can be daunting, so we’ll help to prepare you before you start your placements. You’ll have a gradual introduction to teaching, observing, getting to know your, pupils, classes and the teachers, before having the opportunity to teach classes on your own.\r\n\r\nYou’ll go to at least two contrasting mainstream secondary schools (such as a school in a rural setting or an inner-city comprehensive) or colleges and a primary school. \r\n\r\nOn your placements, you might experience mixed and single-gender schools, City Academies, Comprehensive and Selective Schools, 11-16, 11-18, sixth form, and further education colleges.\r\n\r\nThis variety helps you to experience different situations and further develop your practical skills as a teacher.","personalQualities":"Personal Statement plays important role in admissions process - successful candidates will demonstrate a good understanding of teaching and learning within a secondary school setting. \r\n\r\nYou may wish to evidence your understanding by drawing on related examples or experiences, such as time spent in schools or other learning settings.\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"A Disclosure and Barring Service Check (DBS) and health checks are required.
