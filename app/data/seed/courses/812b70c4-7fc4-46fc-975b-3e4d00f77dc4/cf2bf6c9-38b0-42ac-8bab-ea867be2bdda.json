Why use historical enquiry to investigate the past? How can we make school history as diverse as possible?\r\n\r\nIf the questions above fill you with curiosity this is the course for you!\r\n\r\nOur one-year Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) prepares you to teach across the secondary school history curriculum for the 11-16 age range.\r\n\r\nYou’ll explore inclusive ways to teach history, and develop your ability to teach different historical concepts such as causation, interpretation, change and continuity.\r\n\r\nSome of the key topics you’ll study include how to use sources in the history classroom, the importance of reading and writing when learning history and how to make the history curriculum relevant and inclusive.\r\n\r\nYou will typically have a series of seminars with guest lectures from The National Archives, exam boards, The Holocaust Education Trust, as well as from experienced teachers in schools to help you explore different areas of the history curriculum and how to teach them. \r\n\r\nWhen you are in university, you’ll study mainly with your PGCE History group. You will consider how to plan lessons, reflect on your planning, learn how research can develop your teaching practice, and look at ways to develop your teacher persona. \r\n\r\nYou’ll also learn through peer-collaboration and sharing knowledge with your fellow history trainees to develop your subject knowledge. \r\n\r\nFEATURES AND BENEFITS:\r\n\r\nEmployability - You will have the knowledge, skills and experience to teach history at Key Stage 3, GCSE and potentially A/AS-level. \r\n\r\nSchools experience - You will spend at least the minimum DfE required time in schools (approximately 120 days) on placements in schools, gaining experience in mainstream secondary schools.  \r\n\r\nPostgraduate credits - When you graduate, you’ll achieve 60 masters’ level credits (this is one-third of a masters degree). You can put these towards a masters degree such as our new MTeach course.\r\n\r\nPartnerships - We have partnerships with over 1,500 schools, colleges and educational organisations, meaning we are able to provide students with a range of school experiences.\r\n\r\nResearch-led teaching - Our research centre, ESRI ranks in the UK’s top 20 for research power in Education (Research Excellence Framework, 2014) and recent research sponsors include the Department of Education; Wellcome Trust; European Union; Esmée Fairbairn Foundation; Barclays; Microsoft; Siemens and LEGO.\r\n\r\nFor more information about this course please visit our website: https://www.mmu.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/course/pgce-secondary-history-with-qts.","interviewProcess":"You will be expected to attend an online interview as part of the application process.
