Most of the sessions are in a practical learning environment, in our facilities at Platt Lane Sports Complex.\r\n\r\nThrough peer-teaching you’ll get the opportunity to share experiences and learn from your fellow students in practical lessons, and by delivering GCSE and A-Level theory topics. The course will also include engagement with external providers to facilitate additional sports specific teaching awards.\r\n\r\nThrough this PGCE, you’ll be expected to embed yourself in a range of relevant theory, including child development, subject specific pedagogy, physical learning theory and engage with technology in PE.\r\n\r\nFEATURES AND BENEFITS:\r\n\r\nEmployability - You will have the knowledge, skills and experience to teach Physical Education at Key Stage 3, GCSE and potentially A/AS-level. \r\n\r\nSchools experience - You will spend at least the minimum DfE required time in schools (approximately 120 days) on placements in schools, gaining experience in mainstream secondary schools.  \r\n\r\nPostgraduate credits - When you graduate, you’ll achieve 60 masters’ level credits (this is one-third of a masters degree).
