You’ll engage with teaching strategies to enhance skill development, pupils’ knowledge and understanding in PE, social development and positive emotive experiences in an active learning environment. \r\n\r\nThroughout the course, you’ll also learn how to organise, manage and teach both the practical and the theoretical aspects of the course. Most of the sessions are in a practical learning environment, in our facilities at Platt Lane Sports Complex.\r\n\r\nThrough peer-teaching you’ll get the opportunity to share experiences and learn from your fellow students in practical lessons, and by delivering GCSE and A-Level theory topics. The course will also include engagement with external providers to facilitate additional sports specific teaching awards.\r\n\r\nThrough this PGCE, you’ll be expected to embed yourself in a range of relevant theory, including child development, subject specific pedagogy, physical learning theory and engage with technology in PE.\r\n\r\nFEATURES AND BENEFITS:\r\n\r\nEmployability - You will have the knowledge, skills and experience to teach Physical Education at Key Stage 3, GCSE and potentially A/AS-level. \r\n\r\nSchools experience - You will spend at least the minimum DfE required time in schools (approximately 120 days) on placements in schools, gaining experience in mainstream secondary schools.  \r\n\r\nPostgraduate credits - When you graduate, you’ll achieve 60 masters’ level credits (this is one-third of a masters degree). You can put these towards a masters degree such as our new MTeach course.\r\n\r\nPartnerships - We have partnerships with over 1,500 schools, colleges and educational organisations, meaning we are able to provide students with a range of school experiences.\r\n\r\nResearch-led teaching - Our research centre, ESRI ranks in the UK’s top 20 for research power in Education (Research Excellence Framework, 2014) and recent research sponsors include the Department of Education; Wellcome Trust; European Union; Esmée Fairbairn Foundation; Barclays; Microsoft; Siemens and LEGO.\r\n\r\nFor more information about this course please visit our website: https://www.mmu.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/course/pgce-secondary-physical-education-with-qts","interviewProcess":"You will be expected to attend an online interview as part of the application process.
