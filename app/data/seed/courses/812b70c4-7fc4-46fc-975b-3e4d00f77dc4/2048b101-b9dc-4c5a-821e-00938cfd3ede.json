Will singing in Spanish increase a students’ fluency? Do languages improve students’ literacy and numeracy skills?\r\n\r\nIf the questions above fill you with curiosity this is the course for you!\r\n\r\nOur one-year Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) prepares you to teach across the secondary school Spanish curriculum for the 11-16 age range.\r\n\r\nYou’ll learn how to teach your main language, Spanish, and you may also study a second language too. This gives you the opportunity to teach your second language up to Key Stage 3 or GCSE level (this depends on your linguistic ability and qualifications).\r\n\r\nYou’ll mainly study with your PGCE Spanish group. We'll teach you in your target language to provide an opportunity for you to practise and develop your language.\r\n\r\nYou’ll consider how to plan lessons, reflect on your planning, learn how research can develop your teaching practice, and look at ways to develop your teacher persona.\r\n\r\nYou’ll complete placements in a variety of schools, gradually increasing your involvement to become an expert practitioner.\r\n\r\nOn your placements, you’ll normally have the opportunity to teach your main language and your second language (subject to your level in your second language, and in full discussion with yourself).\r\n\r\nWe also welcome speakers of other languages, and we do our utmost to enable speakers of additional languages to have an opportunity to teach these on placement too. \r\n\r\nFEATURES AND BENEFITS:\r\n\r\nEmployability - You’ll have the skills and experience to teach Spanish at Key Stage 3, GCSE and potentially A/AS-levels.\r\n\r\nSchools experience - You will spend at least the minimum DfE required time in schools (approximately 120 days) on placements in schools, gaining experience in mainstream secondary schools.  \r\n\r\nPostgraduate credits - You’ll achieve 60 masters’ level credits (this is one-third of a masters degree). You can put these towards a masters degree such as our new MTeach course.\r\n\r\nPartnerships - We have partnerships with over 1,500 schools, colleges and educational organisations, we are able to provide students with a range of school experiences.\r\n\r\nResearch-led teaching - Our research centre, ESRI ranks in the UK’s top 20 for research power in Education (Research Excellence Framework, 2014) and recent research sponsors include the DfE; Wellcome Trust; European Union; Esmée Fairbairn Foundation; Barclays; Microsoft; Siemens and LEGO.\r\n\r\nFor more information about this course please visit our website: https://www.mmu.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/course/pgce-secondary-spanish.","interviewProcess":"You will be expected to attend an online interview as part of the application process.
