Does deconstructing artwork help children's literacy skills? How can children use fine art to express their ideas?\r\n\r\nOur one-year Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) prepares you to teach the secondary school art and design curriculum for the 11-16 age range. \r\n\r\nYou’ll learn teaching methods through interactive workshops – we’ll teach you as though you’re a pupil in a school art class. This helps you to experience what it’s like to learn the same way as students and explore the different ways you could teach art activities.\r\n\r\nYou’ll have sessions across art, craft and design, from drawing to printmaking, ceramics to lens-based media such as photography. \r\n\r\nFor specialist mediums, such as ceramics and papercraft, we usually organise a series of guest lectures, inviting artists with expertise in these practices to teach you.\r\n\r\nAnd, you’ll share your specialist art and design skills with your group too (students from past years have shared skills including bookbinding and Photoshop™).\r\n\r\nWhen you’re at Manchester Met, you’ll mainly study with your art and design group. You'll consider how to plan lessons, reflect on your planning, look at ways to develop your teacher persona and understand how research can develop and influence your teaching practice. \r\n\r\nFEATURES AND BENEFITS\r\n\r\nSpecialist facilities - You will have the knowledge, skills and experience to teach art and design at Key Stage 3, GCSE and potentially A/AS-level.\r\n\r\nSchools experience - You will spend at least the minimum DfE required time in schools (approximately 120 days) on placements in schools, gaining experience in mainstream secondary schools. \r\n\r\nRoute options - You can choose University-led or School Direct routes to Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).\r\n\r\nPostgraduate credits - When you graduate, you’ll achieve 60 masters’ level credits (this is one-third of a masters degree). You can put these towards a masters degree to help you develop your new career, such as our new MTeach course. \r\n\r\nPartnerships - We have partnerships with over 1,500 schools, colleges and educational organisations, meaning we are able to provide students with a range of school experiences.\r\n\r\nResearch-led teaching - Our recent research sponsors include the Department of Education; Wellcome Trust; European Union; Esmée Fairbairn Foundation; Barclays; Microsoft; Siemens and LEGO.","interviewProcess":"You will be expected to attend an online interview as part of the application process. Full details of your interview will be provided by email once your application has been approved.\r\n\r\nYour interview will last approximately 30 minutes focusing on your awareness of current secondary art education and your school based experience, and you will have the opportunity to:\r\n\r\n•\tRelate the subject content of your education to the role of a secondary school teacher\r\n•\tDiscuss your relevant experience, e.g. voluntary or paid work, lesson observations, youth work etc.\r\n•\tGive an account of your knowledge of the National Curriculum and what your chosen subject has to offer learners\r\n•\tCommunicate effectively your insights into teaching and learning\r\n•\tShare views about the qualities of a good teacher\r\n•\tDiscuss how you might teach a topic from your chosen subject area\r\n•\tDiscuss principles of inclusion in education\r\n\r\nYou should prepare a portfolio of your previous and current artwork containing a variety of work and sketchbooks, displaying your ability to teach across the Art, Craft & Design curriculum.  Please be prepared to present and discuss your portfolio with the other interviewees. \r\n ","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"\r\nOn this one-year course, you’ll spend a minimum of 120 days on placements in schools.\r\n\r\nWe know that teaching a class can be daunting, so we’ll help to prepare you before you start your placements. You’ll have a gradual introduction to teaching, observing, getting to know your pupils, classes and teachers, before teaching classes on your own.\r\n\r\nThe art activities you teach will depend on the facilities at the school but you might teach GCSE level fine art, including textiles, photography and ceramics.\r\n\r\nYou’ll go to at least two contrasting mainstream secondary schools (such as a school in a rural setting or an inner-city comprehensive) or a college along with some primary school experience.\r\n\r\nOn your placements, you might experience mixed and single-gender schools, City Academies, Comprehensive and Selective Schools, 11-16, 11-18, sixth form, and further education colleges.\r\n\r\nThis variety helps you to experience different situations and further develop your practical skills as a teacher.\r\n","personalQualities":"Personal Statement plays important role in admissions process - successful candidates will demonstrate a good understanding of teaching and learning within a secondary school setting. Candidates may wish to evidence their understanding by drawing on related examples or experiences, such as time spent in schools or other learning settings.\r\n","otherRequirements":"A Disclosure and Barring Service Check (DBS) and health checks are required.
