To ensure this is a success we have grouped the learning that trainee teachers will experience into five clear learning themes which are also linked to the Teachers’ Standards.\r\n\r\nThe learning themes will run through all of our learning areas and ensure the programme is integrated and structured across school-based, centre-based, guided and enrichment learning. This will also ensure that you can see a clear link between the different areas of learning and how these fit into your wider training programme.  \r\n\r\nOur Learning Themes are - \r\n* Subject and Curriculum\r\n* Classroom Management\r\n*  Challenging and Engaging\r\n*  Progressing and Assessing\r\n*  Professional Practice\r\n","interviewProcess":"The Interview process will consist of 5 elements:\r\n1.\tFive minute presentation around the primary/secondary curriculum\r\n\r\n2.\tPupil Activity – Working in small groups you will be asked to facilitate an activity\r\n\r\n3.\tWritten task\r\n\r\n4.\tFormal 1:1 Interview\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"School Based Learning - School Placements\r\nThe age range you will teach on this programme will be 11 to 16.You will experience at least two contrasting placement schools throughout the year as well as some centre based learning being based in schools across the partnership and enrichment opportunities throughout the year. We currently work in partnership with over 50 schools across the North West. \r\n\r\n* Placement A – Autumn/Spring Term\r\n* Placement B - Spring/Summer Term\r\n\r\nYour initial classroom based experience will consist of observations, team teaching with qualified teachers, collaborative teaching and intervention support for targeted groups of pupils with other trainee teachers to build up to whole class teaching (part / whole lessons). This will also include working with pupils on an individual, group and whole class level. \r\n\r\nSpecific school based learning tasks as outlined by the SCITT to link school and centre based learning should shape your professional development to link school and centre based learning.\r\n\r\nEach trainee will have one weekly mentor meeting a week and a minimum of one weekly formal observation by your mentor or class teacher.\r\n\r\nPaired Placement Model \r\n\r\nDuring one of your school placements we will try to ensure a paired placement model with at least one other trainee teacher from the Ashton on Mersey SCITT. When this is the case we encourage you to take advantage of this opportunity. When placed in a paired placement we would like you to try to arrange the following as part of your timetable\r\n\r\n*  An opportunity to plan lessons together which can then be team taught or taught individually to your own class or group. You could then review this lesson together and reflect on the strengths, areas for development and next steps. \r\n\r\n*  An opportunity once a week to formally observe each other teach and provide peer feedback – this could link to your Learning Log observation.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the best way to learn is from one another and that includes your fellow trainee teachers!\r\n\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking to recruit talented candidates who have the qualities and attributes suited to a career in teaching and the drive and ambition to make it happen.\r\n\r\nAs well as meeting the entry requirements for the course we are also looking for the following personal qualities in applicants:\r\n\r\n\r\n* A friendly and approachable nature\r\n* Good interpersonal skills\r\n* Organisation and time management\r\n* A passion for your subject\r\n* A positive outlook\r\n* A creative and innovative approach\r\n* The ability to reflect on and improve practice       \r\n* Potential leadership capabilities\r\n\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"Disclosure and Barring Service\r\nAll trainee teachers must be checked by the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) through the 'Disclosure' process and will be assessed for suitability by the SCITT.\r\n\r\n\r\nHealth Clearance\r\nAs an ITT provider, we need to be certain that applicants are likely to be fit, on completion of the course, for employment as a teacher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:55:49.886Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-21T09:44:27.044Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"}
