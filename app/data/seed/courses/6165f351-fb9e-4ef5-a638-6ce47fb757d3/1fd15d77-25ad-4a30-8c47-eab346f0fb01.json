However, to ensure continuity, the mentors for the B (assessed) placement will have contact with trainees during the first school experience as schools will work in reciprocal pairs as far as possible. University days will take place at the start of the course with an intense period of subject and PE pedagogy input taking place in September. The university may consider holding a summer school in August to ensure trainees are well prepared to meet the demands of school experience A. Unlike many ITE PE programmes, there will be a heavy practical component to the University based module. These sessions will take place at both a central London venue and a few will take place at Kingston University. Assessment and Qualifications As well as school experience and physical education curriculum modules, trainees will complete the Professional and Academic modules that lead to the award of masters credits upon successful completion. These credits can be used to continue on to a Master’s degree in Research at Kingston University for academically ambitious teachers.","personalQualities":"","otherRequirements":"","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:49:33.938Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-19T13:02:58.133Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2023"}
