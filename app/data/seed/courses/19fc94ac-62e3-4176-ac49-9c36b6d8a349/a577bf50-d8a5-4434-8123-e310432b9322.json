Whatever your background, you will have a love of Drama and Theatre Studies and an enthusiasm for performance and a passion for conveying this to students.\r\n\r\nDrama it is a multifaceted subject, that gives students a voice and can unlock an individuals creativity and drive, allowing considerable scope for the autonomy and personal qualities of the individual teacher. These factors are recognised in the course which encourages you to question the nature of the subject, to explore priorities and to develop constructive means for meeting the needs and interests of your students. You will consider the results of recent and relevant research and reflect upon tried and tested teaching and learning strategies and programmes but, as importantly, you will be encouraged to develop your own ideas and strategies.\r\n\r\nAll aspects of the subject are addressed during the course, including meeting the requirements of the National Curriculum and national initiatives such as Assessment for Learning (AfL). With focused study of Drama at post-16 you will not only be equipped to teach pupils and students in the 11-16 age range but will have opportunities to gain experience of teaching at the 16-19 level.\r\n\r\nThrough practical workshops and seminars, the course considers meaningful contexts for the teaching of Drama including Drama as a learning medium and theatre, ‘Teacher in Role’, reading a wide range of literature, watching and developing a variety of performance, media and moving image texts, performing for a variety of styles and audiences. Typical themes are:\r\n\r\n* Drama Skills and techniques\r\n* Group work and the classroom\r\n* Approaches to script and scripted performance\r\n* Approaches devised/improvised performance\r\n* Exploring theatre Practitioners\r\n* Physical Theatre workshops\r\n* Approaches to improvisation, devising drama including design and technical aspects.\r\n\r\nKey models for the teaching of Drama are analysed and different styles of teaching are explored. You will be encouraged to read widely and to employ Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Theatre technology and audio-visual aids such as electronic whiteboards in the classroom.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the course aims to help you become a competent, professional and, above all, creative practitioner, capable of developing the imaginations and abilities of the young people with whom you have the privilege of working.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Our selection process is a two way process where you can find out if the OAKS is the training programme for you and we can decide if you can potentially become a good/outstanding secondary teacher.  We always carry out our interviews in one of our partnership schools, where you will be expected to teach either a class or a small group of their students for 15 minutes.  The students  give us feedback on your lesson, which we share with you during a formal interview.  This focuses on your lesson, your subject knowledge and your commitment to teach.  There are also several tasks for you to complete; these include a written subject specific activity, trial skills tests (unless you have already passed your literacy/numeracy) and a generic writing task.  The whole process should take no more than half a day at the school.  You are interviewed by Partnership School staff and OAKS tutors,  who will talk through the programme and school placements. There will always be plenty of time for you to ask questions and the decision as to whether you are accepted on to the course is usually made on the same day (this may vary depending on the subject/time of year).\r\n\r\nWe want the interview to be a very positive experience for you; please arrive promptly and formal dress is expected.  We look forward to meeting you!\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We will send you to two secondary schools where you will receive an 11-16 experience; the time spent in both of these placements is the same.  Hopefully they will give you two very different experiences.  We make sure that you also receive a pre and post phase enhancement so you will be placed in a primary school for one week and gain experience in a post-16 environment (possibly in one of your secondary placements).  We are very proud of our alternative education placements that we arrange for you on our programme.  Hopefully you will gain experience in an EAL school, pupil referral unit (PRU), special school and maybe an independent school.  \r\n\r\nTravel to and from your placements is always a key concern and we make every effort to make sure that you can easily commute to your schools.  We guarantee that you will never have to travel more than 75 minutes.  In fact, most of our trainees travel well under an hour to their teaching experiences, with many training in the town they live.  \r\n\r\n We train and then monitor all of our school based mentors and the quality of our school’s provision annually; so rest assured that you will have a good teaching experience with us at the OAKS.\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"- Highly motivated individuals who want to make a positive contribution to the education of young people.       \r\n- Trainees who are passionate about their own specialism subject, with very good subject knowledge.  \r\n- Who are able to inspire their learners and create an environment where everyone wants to succeed.       \r\n- Candidates that show enthusiasm and a willingness to participate in the all aspects of the training course.       \r\n- Robust, resilient applicants who want to make a difference in the classroom.       \r\n* People who want to become good or outstanding classroom practitioners, with a desire to improve themselves and their student's.\r\n","otherRequirements":"- a medical report which is deemed satisfactory;\r\n- a completed DBS enhanced disclosure which is deemed satisfactory by the The OAKS;\r\n- a successful completion of a minimum of 10 days teaching experience in a secondary school/college during the last two years. This could be either before or after selection (undertaking this before the selection process commences will strengthen your application).\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-10-22T13:58:29.809Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T15:41:09.058Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2024"}
