French, German and Spanish are the main languages and these are used during session time where appropriate.\r\n\r\nOur Languages programme is a busy and vibrant one!\r\n\r\n-We encourage joining the Association for Language Learning and the attendance of professional conferences such as the Association for Language Learning ‘Languages World’ and ‘Languages Live’ in London.\r\n\r\nAll Languages course participants undertake areas of study in the Learning, Teaching and Assessment in Modern Foreign Languages. The OAKS course is built upon Languages in the NC, the Standards for the award of QTS and the needs of Trainee Teachers, pupils and schools. \r\n\r\nLanguages sessions will essentially look at ways of teaching languages content through the 11-18 age range.\r\nTypical topics for Languages sessions include:\r\n-The learning and teaching of vocabulary, verbs and grammar. \r\n-The formative and summative assessment of languages including Assessment for Learning (AFL) and exam preparation according to the latest GCSE and A level specifications\r\n-The use of authentic resources in the classroom – such as literature, theatre and film, across all Key Stages\r\n-The teaching of languages ‘cross phase’ – exciting ideas and opportunities for teaching languages in and with the primary sector.\r\n\r\nAn essential part of the course is learning how to create a stimulating and caring environment. To help create such an environment, you need to be enthusiastic and lessons need to be well planned and related to the needs of all pupils of all abilities.\r\n\r\nYou need to be passionate about your languages and the countries where they are spoken!\r\n\r\nLessons need to be conducted in a well-organised way with a positive approach to management through well-paced, exciting planning. You will be able to prepare in advance for handling different situations since strategies for good behaviour management are vital to a languages classroom. Language learning is active and sometimes noisy but this needs to happen in a controlled situation to be effective for learners!\r\n","interviewProcess":"Our selection process is a two way process where you can find out if the OAKS is the training programme for you and we can decide if you can potentially become a good/outstanding secondary teacher.  We always carry out our interviews in one of our partnership schools, where you will be expected to teach either a class or a small group of their students for 15 minutes.  The students  give us feedback on your lesson, which we share with you during a formal interview.  This focuses on your lesson, your subject knowledge and your commitment to teach.  There are also several tasks for you to complete; these include a written subject specific activity, trial skills tests (unless you have already passed your literacy/numeracy) and a generic writing task.  The whole process should take no more than half a day at the school.  You are interviewed by Partnership School staff and OAKS tutors,  who will talk through the programme and school placements. There will always be plenty of time for you to ask questions and the decision as to whether you are accepted on to the course is usually made on the same day (this may vary depending on the subject/time of year).\r\n\r\nWe want the interview to be a very positive experience for you; please arrive promptly and formal dress is expected.  We look forward to meeting you!\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We will send you to two secondary schools where you will receive an 11-16 experience; the time spent in both of these placements is the same.  Hopefully they will give you two very different experiences.  We make sure that you also receive a pre and post phase enhancement so you will be placed in a primary school for one week and gain experience in a post-16 environment (possibly in one of your secondary placements).  We are very proud of our alternative education placements that we arrange for you on our programme.  Hopefully you will gain experience in an EAL school, pupil referral unit (PRU), special school and maybe an independent school.  \r\n\r\nTravel to and from your placements is always a key concern and we make every effort to make sure that you can easily commute to your schools.  We guarantee that you will never have to travel more than 75 minutes.  In fact, most of our trainees travel well under an hour to their teaching experiences, with many training in the town they live.  \r\n\r\n We train and then monitor all of our school based mentors and the quality of our school’s provision annually; so rest assured that you will have a good teaching experience with us at the OAKS.\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"- Highly motivated individuals who want to make a positive contribution to the education of young people.       \r\n- Trainees who are passionate about their own specialism subject, with very good subject knowledge.  \r\n- Who are able to inspire their learners and create an environment where everyone wants to succeed.       \r\n- Candidates that show enthusiasm and a willingness to participate in the all aspects of the training course.       \r\n- Robust, resilient applicants who want to make a difference in the classroom.       \r\n* People who want to become good or outstanding classroom practitioners, with a desire to improve themselves and their student's.\r\n","otherRequirements":"- a medical report which is deemed satisfactory;\r\n- a completed DBS enhanced disclosure which is deemed satisfactory by the The OAKS;\r\n- a successful completion of a minimum of 10 days teaching experience in a secondary school/college during the last two years. This could be either before or after selection (undertaking this before the selection process commences will strengthen your application).\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-10-27T13:54:01.687Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-27T13:57:30.272Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2023"}
