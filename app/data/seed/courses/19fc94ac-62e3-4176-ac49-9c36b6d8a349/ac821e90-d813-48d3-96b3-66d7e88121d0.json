Whatever your background, you will have a love of music and an enthusiasm for performance and a passion for conveying this to pupils and students.\r\n\r\nMusic is an universal language that embodies one of the highest forms of creativity.  A high-quality music education should engage and inspire pupils to develop a love of music and their talent as musicians, and so increase their self-confidence, creativity and sense of achievement. As pupils progress, they should develop critical engagement with music, allowing them to compose, and to listen with discrimination to the best in the musical canon.\r\n\r\nHaving an identity as a ‘musician in the classroom’, and the ability to aid creative music-making, are essential to a successful Music teacher. You will build on your existing skills as a musician and develop your subject knowledge in areas of weakness. You should be open to experiencing different styles and genres of music, and be prepared to broaden your musical horizon.  \r\n\r\nTopic and themes of the Music sessions are:\r\n\r\n* Topic Teach\r\n* Planning a Music Curriculum\r\n* Behaviour Management in the Music Classroom\r\n* Working with Music Technology\r\n* Building Resources\r\n* Outstanding Music Teaching\r\n\r\nAn important part of the course is learning to create a stimulating and caring environment. To help create such an environment, you need to be enthusiastic and lessons need to be well planned and related to the needs of pupils. They need to be conducted in a well-organised way with a positive approach to control. You will be able to prepare in advance for handling different situations, develop strategies for maintaining discipline and managing the learning in a practical musical environment.\r\nKey models for the teaching of Music are analysed and different styles of teaching are explored. You will be encouraged to read widely and to employ Information and Communication Technology (ICT), role-play and audio-visual aids such as electronic whiteboards in the classroom.\r\n\r\nThese sessions are delivered by a Music Subject Expert in one of our partnership schools. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, the course aims to help you become a competent, professional and, above all, creative teacher, capable of developing the imaginations and abilities of the young people with whom you have the privilege of working.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Our selection process is a two way process where you can find out if the OAKS is the training programme for you and we can decide if you can potentially become a good/outstanding secondary teacher.  We always carry out our interviews in one of our partnership schools, where you will be expected to teach either a class or a small group of their students for 15 minutes.  The students give us feedback on your lesson, which we share with you during a formal interview.  This focuses on your lesson, your subject knowledge and your commitment to teach.  There are also several tasks for you to complete; these include a written subject specific activity, trial skills tests (unless you have already passed your literacy/numeracy) and a generic writing task.  The whole process should take no more than half a day at the school.  You are interviewed by Partnership School staff and OAKS tutors,  who will talk through the programme and school placements. There will always be plenty of time for you to ask questions and the decision as to whether you are accepted on to the course is usually made on the same day (this may vary depending on the subject/time of year).\r\n\r\nWe want the interview to be a very positive experience for you; please arrive promptly and formal dress is expected.  We look forward to meeting you!\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We will send you to two secondary schools where you will receive an 11-16 experience; the time spent in both of these placements is the same.  Hopefully they will give you two very different experiences. We make sure that you also receive a pre and post phase enhancement so you will be placed in a primary school for one week and gain experience in a post-16 environment (possibly in one of your secondary placements).  We are very proud of our alternative education placements that we arrange for you on our programme.  Hopefully you will gain experience in an EAL school, pupil referral unit (PRU), special school and maybe an independent school.  \r\n\r\nTravel to and from your placements is always a key concern and we make every effort to make sure that you can easily commute to your schools.  We guarantee that you will never have to travel more than 75 minutes.  In fact, most of our trainees travel well under an hour to their teaching experiences. \r\n\r\n We train and then monitor all of our school based mentors and the quality of our school’s provision annually; so rest assured that you will have a good teaching experience with us at the OAKS.\r\n","personalQualities":"- Highly motivated individuals who want to make a positive contribution to the education of young people.       \r\n- Trainees who are passionate about their own specialism subject, with very good subject knowledge.  \r\n- Who are able to inspire their learners and create an environment where everyone wants to succeed.       \r\n- Candidates that show enthusiasm and a willingness to participate in the all aspects of the training course.       \r\n- Robust, resilient applicants who want to make a difference in the classroom.       \r\n- People who want to become good or outstanding classroom practitioners, with a desire to improve themselves and their student's.\r\n","otherRequirements":"- a medical report which is deemed satisfactory;\r\n- a completed DBS enhanced disclosure which is deemed satisfactory by the The OAKS;\r\n- a successful completion of a minimum of 10 days teaching experience in a secondary school/college during the last two years. This could be either before or after selection (undertaking this before the selection process commences will strengthen your application).\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-10-27T12:11:51.658Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-27T12:18:11.208Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2024"}
