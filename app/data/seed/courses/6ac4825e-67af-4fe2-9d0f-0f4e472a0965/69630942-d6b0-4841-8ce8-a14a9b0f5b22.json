Last year all trainees completed the award had secured teaching positions before their graduation and all of our trainees were judged to be good or outstanding by their school based mentors.","interviewProcess":"","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The programme is strongly rooted in a School and University partnership so Associate Teachers spend 3 days in their placement school and two days at University for their first placement. This enables a constant reflection on practice and the opportunity to move their thinking across all areas.\r\n\r\nThe core programme begins with a two week subject knowledge enhancement in Literacy and Mathematics. This is to promote the Associate Teacher's understanding of progression across the key concepts in these two core curriculum areas. From there the Associate Teacher moves into a carefully balanced theoretical and practical application of their understanding.\r\n\r\nThere is a statutory regulation of 120 days in school, on this course Associate Teachers have the opportunity to work within two partner primary schools, approximately 60 days in each.","personalQualities":"","otherRequirements":"","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:20.250Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-08T15:30:35.160Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2023"}
