Trainees who complete the course receive a PGCE from Bath Spa University and Qualified Teacher Status. \r\n\r\nThe programme is a blend of school-based and central training. The induction phase of the course (two weeks) is held at the PCP SCITT training centre and focusses on key skills and concepts such as how children learn, behaviour management, planning and assessment. For the rest of the course, trainees spend 4 days a week in their placement school, and one day a week at the PCP SCITT training centre.  \r\n\r\nWeekly SCITT central training workshops and seminars are led by experienced education professionals and senior leaders. Subject sessions cover the core curriculum areas of English, Maths and Science and introduce the full range of non-core subjects including ICT, Art, Geography and Religious Education. Professional Studies sessions draw on up-to-date research to progressively build on trainees’ understanding of the theory and practice of teaching and learning. Particular importance is placed on trainees’ subject knowledge for teaching and the acquisition of high-quality teaching practices that support strong pupil progress. \r\n\r\nSchool-based training is supervised by a school mentor, usually the class teacher, who guides trainees as they put into practice the techniques and knowledge learned during central training session. Initially trainees work alongside their mentor with small groups of children. As trainees develop their skills in a classroom context, they are supported to take on greater independence and responsibility for whole class teaching including planning, teaching and assessing. \r\n\r\nMentors meet with trainees on a weekly basis to provide feedback, offer support, and set achievable development goals. Trainees are allocated a SCITT link tutor, who quality assures the school-based training and provides additional support and advice. PCP mentors and link tutors are chosen for their professional expertise and undertake yearly professional development to ensure PCP trainees receive high quality training. \r\n\r\nAssessment opportunities support trainees in meeting the Teachers’ Standards (2011) and the requirements for PGCE Master’s credits through Bath Spa University. Over the year, trainees undertake three written assignments to deepen their understanding of core professional practice. Assessed teaching observations and ongoing feedback supports trainees in knowing exactly how they are progressing and their next steps to reach even higher standards of professional practice.  \r\n","interviewProcess":"\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Trainees undertake two teaching placements in carefully selected contrasting schools and key stages. Trainees specialising in the General Primary (5 – 11) age range undertake one placement in a Key Stage One setting and one in Key Stage Two. \r\n\r\nPCP SCITT is pleased to partner with over 30 schools throughout Hampshire, Dorset, Wiltshire and IOW. Schools are selected on the basis of excellence in teaching and learning, evidence of quality mentoring and professional development, and the ability to provide rich and diverse learning opportunities for PCP trainees. Fostering productive, professional relationships between school, SCITT and trainee is at the centre of our successful teacher training programme. \r\n\r\nApplicants are invited to express a preference for a placement school at interview. Whenever possible this preference is taken into consideration, along with personal circumstances, geographical location and educational best fit based on the trainees’ prior experience.
