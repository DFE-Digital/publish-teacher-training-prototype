As part of their Professional Learning, trainees will undertake an Enquiry Based Pedagogy Project of their choice.\r\nTrainees will have placements in 2 different Partner Schools.  Trainees will be able to observe teaching and learning in other educational settings eg. Special Schools, Pupil Referral Unit and Primary Schools.

A teaching timetable will be created that is bespoke to each trainee based upon their prior experience and readiness to teach.  \r\nThroughout the year, trainees will have a designated Mentor/Coach supporting them as well as, Phase and Subject Leads from Hillingdon SCITT.
