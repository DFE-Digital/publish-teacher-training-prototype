In addition, there are opportunities for ‘hands on’ learning experiences in our Primary alliance hub reception classrooms where you will be able to put your learning into practice. \r\nTraining sessions relating to broader aspects of Primary teaching will be undertaken alongside Primary PGCE peers. \r\n\r\nIn line with the ITT core content framework, our School Direct PGCE with QTS programme allows you to engage with the necessary knowledge and skills to meet the Teachers’ Standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and the PGCE award. The PGCE carries 60 credits at Masters Level which could later contribute towards a Master’s Degree in Education (180 credits). \r\n\r\nOur programme is run in an academic partnership with the University of Cumbria. Alongside school based training, you will also undertake two 30-credit masters level modules, to gain a PGCE. These modules are practically focused and titled ‘Raising the Achievement of Children’ and ‘High Quality Learning and Teaching’, both are designed to focus on your priorities and interests as you develop your teaching skills. They involve a total of 3 written assessments, one of which is a formative piece to support your academic development. These modules are taught by the University of Cumbria lecturers, who work closely with our school direct programme team, to ensure that theory and practice are closely entwined to really inform your teaching and give you a useful toolkit to take forward in your career. \r\n\r\nThe majority of your training will be delivered in school or at dedicated sessions in our Training Centre. You will benefit from the knowledge and experience of practising teachers and headteachers.\r\n","interviewProcess":"All of our interviews usually take place in a local school setting, led by our Primary and Early Primary Programme Leads.  You are required to complete three tasks – \r\n\r\n* Mini teach – You will be informed prior to the interview day about the age of the children and the curriculum area that is the focus. This is your opportunity to demonstrate your ability to plan an age appropriate task, linked to an area of the curriculum, whilst managing the behaviour of a small group. Your rapport with the children will also be observed. \r\n\r\n* A discussion task that will allow you to demonstrate your awareness of the level of academic required when studying at this level\r\n\r\n* Interview - The final part of the process is an interview which will allow the interviewers to gauge your ability and potential to complete the course.\r\n\r\nWe will provide more structured information nearer the time of interview.\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"When you train with the Catholic Teaching Alliance your placements are in our Catholic alliance schools.

You will have the chance to involve yourself in school life, develop your ability to manage other people within the classroom and learn essential skills to enable you to confidently plan, deliver and reflect on sequences of lessons across the curriculum.\r\n\r\nYour final ‘Extending' placement will, generally, be in a contrasting setting, in a Key Stage of your choice. \r\n\r\nWhen you train with Catholic Teaching Alliance you will be supported throughout all of your placements by a trained mentor within the school and supported by our Primary Programme Leads who will ensure that you have every support to enable you to achieve success.
