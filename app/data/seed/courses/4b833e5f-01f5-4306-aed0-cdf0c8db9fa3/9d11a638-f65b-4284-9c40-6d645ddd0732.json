Hillingdon SCITT trainees will be trained to teach 2 consecutive Secondary Key Stages (KS3 and KS4) in their chosen subject.  Trainees will also experience some KS5.  Simultaneously trainees will also be given the opportunity to improve and expand their subject knowledge. During the training year trainees may have the opportunity to teach a 2nd subject of their choice.\r\n\r\nAll trainees will spend 4 days a week in school.  This will comprise of observing and learning from experienced colleagues, teaching, being observed and receiving feedback, as well as professional development.  The 5th day will be a Professional Learning day with Hillingdon SCITT, which will be held at Bishop Ramsey CE School (which is where Hillingdon SCITT is based) and will be delivered by highly experienced and skilled practitioners.  As part of their Professional Learning, trainees will undertake an Enquiry Based Pedagogy Project of their choice.\r\nTrainees will have placements in 2 different Partner Schools.  Trainees will be able to observe teaching and learning in other educational settings eg. Special Schools, Pupil Referral Unit and Primary Schools. Whilst on placement, the amount of lessons that a fee funded (unsalaried) trainee will be expected to teach is incremental according to each training phase.  A teaching timetable will be created that is bespoke to each trainee based upon their prior experience and readiness to teach.  \r\nThroughout the year, trainees will have a designated Mentor/Coach supporting them as well as, Phase and Subject Leads from Hillingdon SCITT.  To achieve QTS, all trainees at calendared intervals throughout the year will be assessed against their mastery of the ITE Curriculum as well as the Teachers' Standards.\r\n\r\nTrainees who meet requirements of the PGCert for Brunel University will have the opportunity to study for this alongside the QTS (QTS is accredited by Hillingdon SCITT).
