The Friday conferences will be hosted and delivered by outstanding classroom practitioners who currently teach in our partner schools. Curriculum conferences will be held in several of our school venues according to the best expertise available for each topic.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there will be subject development days during the year where trainees will focus on teaching Mathematics specifically. These will be delivered by a Lead Subject Mentor for Mathematics, a Specialist Leader of Education who has been appointed due to their successful track record in subject leadership. The days incorporate learning walks and lesson experience alongside input from the Lead Subject Mentor and directed tasks for you to consolidate your learning.\r\n\r\nYou will audit your subject knowledge for the topics you will need to teach at KS3 and 4. Lead Subject Mentors will guide you towards great resources for this and you will be encouraged to join a professional subject association. A shared drive enables you to share resources with each other and school mentors. We can also organise additional training courses and access to resources at no cost to you.\r\n\r\nLeeds Beckett provide the PGCE for our SCITT and this is all online. The modules perfectly compliment the training we deliver and you will gain 60 Master’s level credits\r\n(https://courses.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/PGCE_distancelearning/)\r\n\r\nAssessment of trainees for QTS is based on all of the following:\r\n- Regular observations of lessons with feedback and target setting\r\n- Progress towards meeting the Teacher Standards at Key Assessment Points\r\n- Assessment of a Best Evidence Portfolio at the end of the programme. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"You will complete placements in two partner schools. The first placement will begin early in September, an excellent time to see how rules and routines are established at the start of the academic year. You will start with focused lesson observations across the whole school before you join your subject department and begin to plan teach parts of lessons. After a few weeks you will be planning and delivering whole lessons, building up to approximately 7 hours per week by Christmas. \r\n\r\nThe second placement begins after Christmas in a different school which will give you a contrasting experience and broaden your professional development. Again, you will gradually increase your teaching timetable and for the last few weeks will be full time in school, teaching up to 12 hours per week at that point.\r\n\r\nPlacements are selected for you on the basis of high quality mentoring, strong subject departments, contrasting schools and reasonable commuting distance. We work with a wide range of schools located throughout South Cumbria and North Lancashire.\r\n\r\nOn both placements you will teach the full 11-16 age range in your subject. \r\nThere may also be opportunities to spend some time in other partner schools and settings as training needs arise. There will be additional opportunities to experience primary education and sixth form education on the programme. \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will complete placements in two partner schools.
