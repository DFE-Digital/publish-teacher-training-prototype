As such all the student teachers undertaking this course are highly likely to be eligible for Student Finance support. As part of our access to learning fund, we may be able to support those in financial hardship with course-related costs incurred during training. We also offer a termly contribution to all trainees with a household income lower than £25,000 as assessed by Student Finance.","aboutCourse":"During the first term of the course you will engage with Professional Studies and Subject Studies alongside your school placements.  This encourages our student teachers to think about the content discussed during their Professional Studies sessions, their application within the context of their subject specialism and the opportunity to put ideas into practice. As your confidence in the classroom develops, you will extend your time on placement in preparation for your first year as an Early Career Teacher.\r\nEducation & Professional Studies Programme (EPS), sessions based at Truro College: provides a framework for student teachers to develop as professional educators by providing a broader perspective on educational themes that set the context for learning. EPS sessions include support for the Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) with dedicated academic tutors to guide your academic progress. The PGCE, delivered in partnership with Bath Spa University, is assessed by the submission of 3 assignments. The final award is equal to 60 credits at Level 7 (masters level).\r\nSubject Studies Sessions: Subject Studies develops subject knowledge in relation to curriculum needs, appropriate teaching and learning strategies, with a particular focus on how educational issues such as assessment, planning and delivery can be most effectively achieved in the classroom.  Subject sessions develop your existing subject knowledge, while identifying ways to share this knowledge in a manageable format with young learners. The focus is on practical solutions to ensure that you develop as a creative and reflective classroom practitioner.\r\nSchool placements: for all student teachers, the most exciting part of the training programme is their time spent in schools. We have a well-established record of providing the high quality school placements.\r\nOne of our greatest strengths is our bespoke training programme coordinated by our team. Every student teacher will receive support from a dedicated mentor whilst on placement, and also additional training from the school’s professional tutor. Our mentors support trainees to develop at their own pace, from observing lessons to planning and implementing their own series of lessons by the end of the course. The placements are at two schools: one placement will be at one of the schools within The Roseland Trust and the other in one of 25 SCITT partner schools. You will be assessed by a portfolio of evidence collected while on placement, leading to the award of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).\r\n","interviewProcess":"All applications are reviewed by our management team prior to selection: those successful will be invited to interview. Applicants will be asked to prepare several tasks, including a pre-interview subject knowledge audit and a short written reflection on an educational topic.\r\n\r\nAll candidates will be asked to deliver a short teaching episode to an interview panel of up to three people, including a member of the management team and a subject leader, with the panel assuming the role of learners. Following the teaching episode, the interview panel will discuss the application in greater detail, including reflections on school experience gained prior to interview, subject knowledge and preparedness to enter the teaching profession.  Candidates are also asked to bring a small portfolio of their design work, and samples of made products if suitable.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The Roseland Academy is part of The Roseland Trust (TRT) which includes two primary schools and three secondary schools in different geographical locations. The Roseland Academy collaborates with Cornwall SCITT in partnership with more than 25 secondary schools in Cornwall, including a Special School Trust and Alternative Provision Multi-Academy Trust. At interview, the panel will discuss your placement needs and identify suitable placements accordingly. We aim to place trainees within 30-40 minutes of their home, but occasionally this can take longer, especially for those living in more rural areas.  \r\nWe aim to give trainees a broad range of experiences during the course, and aspire to offer contrasting placements.\r\nTrainees will usually experience two school placements: either spending both placements within TRT schools, or alternatively, have the second placement with one other partner SCITT secondary school in Cornwall as put into place together with Cornwall SCITT.\r\nPlacements will focus on the 11-16 age range, but post-16 experience can be gained either through sixth form participation in of a secondary school within TRT placement, or an arranged short placement in a tertiary College. \r\nThe Professional Studies programme in your placement will be extensive and feature input from dedicated colleagues. You will be able to develop strategies related to the latest research.  When training with TRT you will also access the Trust-wide CPD. Whilst involved in your placement in the school you will be fully immersed in school life. The Roseland Academy is a designated Teaching School Hub for East Cornwall and you will be able to explore opportunities for your future development.\r\nYour school placements will develop sequentially from 3-days per week to 5 as the terms and training year progress. This allows you to embed theory and practice in a measured and manageable way, and develop in confidence as you progress towards your final assessment and, moving forwards, your first employed post. \r\nWe are re safer keeping it to a broad-brush description at the moment, as the fine detail structure of the course may need to be tweaked again next year once we gather feedback from all the stakeholders.\r\n","personalQualities":"The application form and interview process is designed to assess suitability to train to teach and will focus on the applicant’s:\r\n\r\n* Commitment to the teaching profession and improving the lives of young people;\r\n* Enthusiasm for the chosen subject and a capacity to inspire learners;\r\n* Awareness of current educational issues;\r\n* Intrinsic passion for learning;\r\n* Commitment to own professional development;\r\n* Excellent organisational, communication and interpersonal skills;\r\n* Ability to establish effective relationships with both pupils and adults;\r\n* Flexibility and a willingness to act upon advice;\r\n* Emotional and physical resilience and readiness for hard work\r\n","otherRequirements":"As part of our commitment to safer recruitment, all successful candidates will undergo the full range of safeguarding checks, including their health & physical capacity to teach.\r\nFor those who have spent more than 3 months working or living abroad you may be required to gain a letter of good conduct or a workplace reference.\r\nWe are expected to make an assessment of fundamental English and mathematics knowledge before QTS is awarded. Any work to address shortfalls in English and mathematics must be undertaken by the trainee teacher in addition to other aspects of their training.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-10-13T13:06:15.489Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-19T08:58:47.247Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2023"}
