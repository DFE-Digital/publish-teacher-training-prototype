This is a flexible route for those with previous workplace experience who wish to teach Design and Technology in secondary schools.\r\n \r\nThis is an employment-based route so you will be employed in a school whilst you train.\r\n \r\nThe School Direct (salaried) programme is intended for high quality career changers. There is an expectation that applicants for the School Direct (salaried) pathway will have a good first degree and must demonstrate substantial career experience. ‘Trainees’ on the School Direct (salaried) route are not expected to teach more than 90% of a qualified teacher’s workload and will receive structured training during the programme. This will include self-study using online materials. The ‘trainee’ will have the same rights and responsibilities as a teacher.\r\n \r\nOn successful completion you will be awarded Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). It is possible that in some school trainees will also be able to work for the award of PGCE.","interviewProcess":"All applications are reviewed by our management team prior to selection: those successful will be invited to interview. Applicants will be asked to prepare several tasks, including a pre-interview subject knowledge audit and a short written reflection on an educational topic.\r\n\r\nAll candidates will be asked to deliver a short teaching episode to an interview panel of up to three people, including a member of the management team and a subject leader, with the panel assuming the role of learners. Following the teaching episode, the interview panel will discuss the application in greater detail, including reflections on school experience gained prior to interview, subject knowledge and preparedness to enter the teaching profession.  Candidates are also asked to bring a small portfolio of their design work, and samples of made products if suitable.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The Roseland Academy is part of The Roseland Trust (TRT) which includes two primary schools and three secondary schools in different geographical locations. The Roseland Academy collaborates with Cornwall SCITT in partnership with more than 25 secondary schools in Cornwall, including a Special School Trust and Alternative Provision Multi-Academy Trust. At interview, the panel will discuss your placement needs and identify suitable placements accordingly. We aim to place trainees within 30-40 minutes of their home, but occasionally this can take longer, especially for those living in more rural areas.  \r\nAs part of following the salaried route, the trainees will experience two school placements: having their placement in their school where they are employed and  have their second placement within the Partnership. \r\nPlacements will focus on the 11-16 age range, but post-16 experience can be gained either through sixth form participation in of a secondary school, or an arranged short placement in a tertiary College.\r\nYour school placements will develop sequentially from 4-days per week to 5 as the terms and training year progress. This allows you to embed theory and practice in a measured and manageable way, and develop in confidence as you progress towards your final assessment and, moving forwards, your first employed post. \r\nWe are safer keeping it to a broad-brush description at the moment, as the fine detail structure of the course may need to be tweaked again next year once we gather feedback from all the stakeholders.","personalQualities":"The application form and interview process is designed to assess suitability to train to teach and will focus on the applicant’s:\r\n\r\n* Commitment to the teaching profession and improving the lives of young people;\r\n* Enthusiasm for the chosen subject and a capacity to inspire learners;\r\n* Awareness of current educational issues;\r\n* Intrinsic passion for learning;\r\n* Commitment to own professional development;\r\n* Excellent organisational, communication and interpersonal skills;\r\n* Ability to establish effective relationships with both pupils and adults;\r\n* Flexibility and a willingness to act upon advice;\r\n* Emotional and physical resilience and readiness for hard work","otherRequirements":"As part of our commitment to safer recruitment, all successful candidates will undergo the full range of safeguarding checks, including their health & physical capacity to teach.\r\nFor those who have spent more than 3 months working or living abroad you may be required to gain a letter of good conduct or a workplace reference.\r\nWe are expected to make an assessment of fundamental English and mathematics knowledge before QTS is awarded. Any work to address shortfalls in English and mathematics must be undertaken by the trainee teacher in addition to other aspects of their training.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2022-01-18T12:27:19.032Z","updatedAt":"2022-01-27T08:26:04.531Z","canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","cycle":"2023","salaryDetails":"Those following a School Direct Salaried Programme are not eligible to receive student support or a Department for Education Bursary/Scholarship.\r\n\r\nTrainees will be employed on the Unqualified Teachers Pay Scale, and the salary is subject to employment-based deductions including National Insurance, Income Tax and Pensions contributions. \r\n\r\nThere are no course fees for those following this route with a QTS only outcome.
