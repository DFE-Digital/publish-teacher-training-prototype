This training day is split between General Professional Studies (GPS) in the morning at the Braintree Arts Theatre, with all the other trainee teachers.  This is followed by Subject Professional Studies (SPS), in your smaller subject groups.  This ongoing training model allows you to explore something in theory and then try it out in practice the very next day.\r\n\r\nOur part-time courses are designed to fit round you and will offer half the time in school each week, completed over two years.  This can either be two full days or four half days.  You will also have one full training day at the Braintree Arts Theatre with all the other trainees on a Thursday.\r\n\r\nYou will have a main placement school which allows you to settle in fully into your department and become part of the teaching team.  Pupils see you as their teacher and you gain a real insight into life in a school.  A shorter, second placement in a different school (in February/March) then allows you to try ideas out and see another way of working.  You will also have the opportunity to visit a primary school, a school for children with special educational needs and a school in challenging circumstances.  \r\n\r\nTrainees undertaking the PGCE will attend further training in the form of six Academic Days which will give you guidance on academic research and writing.  You will also be able to access the online library of the University of Greenwich.","interviewProcess":"Mid Essex ITT will co-ordinate the recruitment process and it will involve a full day spent at our central offices at Notley High School and Braintree Sixth Form. It will include a critique of a lesson, a short written test for literacy and participation in a group discussion. You will be expected to do a short presentation in front of a small group of Year 8 students and will be interviewed by staff from Mid Essex ITT and our consortium schools.  Not only is the day an excellent opportunity for you to show us your passion and relevant skills, it is a chance for you to meet the Mid Essex team and find out more about our course.\r\n\r\nIf you are applying for the salaried route, you will also need to attend a further interview with a placement school before being offered a place on the course.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Mid Essex ITT works with over 20 schools across Essex, many of which have been working with us for over 25 years.  You will have the opportunity to work at two of these schools. \r\n\r\nWe aim to place you in a school which best suits your requirements.  At your interview and assessment day, you will be asked to complete a form detailing which of our schools you would be placed at and we will try our best to place you at one of your choices.  Early applicants will find it easier to be placed at one of their top choices so we do recommend applying as early as possible if you are interested in training in certain schools.\r\n\r\nOur schools offer a range of experiences and you will train to teach Modern Languages across the 11 -16 age range with a post-16 enhancement, with teaching opportunities available across the partnership. ","personalQualities":"* Commitment, enthusiasm, passion, resilience â€“ this is a tough course\r\n* Suitable and relevant qualifications to meet the eligibility criteria\r\n* Good subject knowledge (probably with a few gaps)\r\n* Relevant experience: how do you know this is for you?\r\n* Good standards of written and oral English","otherRequirements":"Mid Essex ITT is committed to safer recruitment.
