The course will equip you to respond effectively to the issues currently affecting schools. We place a strong emphasis on developing your individual strengths and skills within the content of the contemporary education environment.\r\n\r\nThe award of PGCE is offered at two levels:\r\n*Professional Graduate Certificate in Education; and\r\n*Postgraduate Certificate in Education, where 60 Masters-level credits can be gained.\r\n\r\nBoth of these are recognised teaching qualifications but the postgraduate award will allow fast-track entry onto a Masters course. \r\nSuccessful completion of the PGCE leads to Qualified Teacher Status.

This practical teaching is supported by University-based lectures, seminars, workshops and tutorials exploring learning and teaching in your subject and in the wider context.

The interview will focus on your personal qualities and skills, your suitability for teaching, your experience of working with young children in school settings and your current studies or employment.  \r\n\r\nYou will also be asked to evidence, up to three, examples of your practical work in an aspect of design and technology. You will be asked to use these examples to self-assess your readiness to teach in areas of the design and technology curriculum, and to answer a number of design and technology questions.
