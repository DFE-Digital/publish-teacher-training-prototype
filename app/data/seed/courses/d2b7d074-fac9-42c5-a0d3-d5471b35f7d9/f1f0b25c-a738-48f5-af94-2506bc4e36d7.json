The course will equip you to respond effectively to the issues currently affecting schools. We place a strong emphasis on developing your individual strengths and skills within the context of the contemporary education environment. \r\n\r\nThe award of PGCE is offered at two levels: \r\n\r\n*Professional Graduate Certificate in Education; and \r\n\r\n*Postgraduate Certificate in Education, where 60 Masters-level credits can be gained. \r\n\r\nBoth of these are recognised teaching qualifications but the postgraduate award will allow fast-track entry onto a Masters course.  Successful completion of the PGCE leads to Qualified Teacher Status. \r\n\r\nThe majority of your time will be spent on placement in schools or colleges. This practical teaching is supported by both face to face and online University lectures, seminars, workshops and tutorials exploring learning and teaching in your subject and in the wider context. Trainees also engage in an independent research project that draws together academic and professional practice. \r\n\r\nIf you are passionate about science and wish to enthuse the next generation of young people, this course will allow you to fulfil your ambitions and  become an excellent science teacher. The course is designed to combine your learning through practice, with an understanding of some of the theory underpinning effective teaching and learning. You’ll also study the use of assessment, out of school activities, and consider the implications of health and safety and safeguarding. \r\n\r\nAll trainees study the application of their scientific knowledge to teaching situations. University-based study is divided into four areas. This includes science education and the methodology of biology, chemistry and physics. ","interviewProcess":"All interviews for the 2021-2022 academic year will be conducted online using Microsoft TEAMS.\r\n\r\nYou will be provided information regarding set tasks which need to be completed prior to the interview day.  These will form the basis of some discussion at the interview, including a discussion centred on an activity where you have planned a short lesson.\r\n\r\nYou will have an individual interview with one of the course tutors. The interview will focus on your personal qualities and skills, your suitability for teaching, your experience of working with young children in school settings and your current studies or employment. You may be required to do other tasks during your interview, such as a presentation based on your teaching subject area, or a group activity.\r\n\r\nYou will complete an English task of your reading and writing ability so we can ensure that you have a good and accurate use of Standard English.\r\n\r\nDuring the interview, candidates will be asked about their subject knowledge. In some cases applicants may need to have their specific subject knowledge refreshed or enhanced before they begin an ITT course. For example if a candidate has: \r\n\r\na degree that’s related to the subject rather than an exact match for it; \r\n\r\nstudied the subject at A level, but not degree level; \r\n\r\nan unrelated degree but relevant professional knowledge in the subject. \r\n\r\nThe whole interview process will take around 90 minutes. \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"This may be subject to change during the Covid-19 pandemic.\r\nSchool or college experience is central to the Secondary PGCE at NTU. It is usual to spend a minimum of 24 weeks on placement in at least two secondary schools or colleges. For both placements, training is planned by mentors to enable students to attain QTS. This practical teaching element is assessed on a regular basis via formal observation by a school mentor and a University tutor, enabling us to monitor each individual trainee’s progress and effectively support their development. We are in partnership with a wide range of schools so your placements may be in city centre, suburban or semi-rural locations. This variety provides opportunities for a wide range of teaching experiences and lays a good foundation for your future professional development.\r\n \r\n","personalQualities":"","otherRequirements":"You'll need to undergo a Disclosure and Barring Service check, a Prohibition Order check and complete a Fit to Practice (FTP) questionnaire before you start the course. \r\n\r\nWhat is an FTP?\r\nThe health questionnaire is part of the Fitness to Practice process that you are required to undertake, prior to you commencing an Initial Teacher Training course.
