The course will equip you to respond effectively to the issues currently affecting schools. We place a strong emphasis on developing your individual strengths and skills within the context of the contemporary education environment. \r\n\r\nThe award of PGCE is offered at two levels: \r\n\r\n*Professional Graduate Certificate in Education; and \r\n\r\n*Postgraduate Certificate in Education, where 60 Masters-level credits can be gained. \r\n\r\nBoth of these are recognised teaching qualifications but the postgraduate award will allow fast-track entry onto a Masters course.  Successful completion of the PGCE leads to Qualified Teacher Status. \r\n\r\nThe majority of your time will be spent on placement in schools or colleges. This practical teaching is supported by both face to face and online University lectures, seminars, workshops and tutorials exploring learning and teaching in your subject and in the wider context. Trainees also engage in an independent research project that draws together academic and professional practice. \r\n\r\nThe PGCE in Business Studies prepares students to teach across the 14 to 19 age range, helping them to develop the professional skills and attitudes to teach business in schools and colleges, as part of both academic (A level and GCSE) and BTEC courses. \r\n\r\nStudents will understand how business is taught in schools, how pupils learn and make sense of the evolving nature of business. The course reflects the range of business related courses that are now offered by schools, sixth forms and colleges, with the focus in some instances on entrepreneurship, work skills and new business technologies.","interviewProcess":"Before the interview, you will be asked to complete two tasks.
