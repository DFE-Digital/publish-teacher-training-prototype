Trainees will develop an understanding of the nature of mathematics and its place in the National Curriculum, how pupils learn to think and reason mathematically and how to teach mathematics in such a way that learners enjoy it and choose to study it. The programme utilises a body of established knowledge in mathematics education, but also keeps you abreast of the latest developments.
