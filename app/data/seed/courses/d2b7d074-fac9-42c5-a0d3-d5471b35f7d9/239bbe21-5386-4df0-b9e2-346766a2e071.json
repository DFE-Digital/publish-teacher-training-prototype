The majority of your time will be spent on placement in schools or colleges. This practical teaching is supported by University-based lectures, seminars, workshops and tutorials which explore:\r\n•\tlearning and teaching in mathematics;\r\n•\tgeneral issues that affect all teachers, such as inclusion and behaviour management.\r\nWell-qualified mathematics teachers are in high demand in the UK and internationally. Trainees will develop an understanding of the nature of mathematics and its place in the National Curriculum, how pupils learn to think and reason mathematically and how to teach mathematics in such a way that learners enjoy it and choose to study it. The programme utilises a body of established knowledge in mathematics education, but also keeps you abreast of the latest developments.
