You will still have plenty of opportunity to build your teaching experience with school placements throughout the year.\r\n\r\nYour school placements will build your skills and confidence as you progress towards Qualified Teacher Status, while your academic sessions will deepen your understanding both of your subject and your profession. Our Schools Teaching Alliance partners work with us to develop our courses and to give you the best possible experience of teaching and learning.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to delivering outstanding education and training that is current and relevant. You will develop your knowledge and understanding of  both Religious Education and wider educational issues. You will leave us ready to be an outstanding teacher and leader with a strong professional identity.\r\n\r\nFor full course information, please see the York St John University website:\r\nhttps://www.yorksj.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/education/secondary-education-re-pgce/","interviewProcess":"","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The programme employs a range of learning and teaching strategies, including enquiry based and active learning approaches.
