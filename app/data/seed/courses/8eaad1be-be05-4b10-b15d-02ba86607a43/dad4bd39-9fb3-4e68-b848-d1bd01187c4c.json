As part of the interview candidates may be asked to teach a lesson of about 30 minutes to a class. Candidates may be asked to undertake a written task as part of the interview.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Candidates as part of the application process:\r\n* nominate a school to train within \r\n* the age range they wish to teach \r\nCandidates will spend the majority of their time within their nominated school but will also undertake, at least, a six week placement in a second school.
