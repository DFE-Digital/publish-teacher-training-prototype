You may be eligible for a maintenance loan to cover living costs while you undertake initial teacher training.\r\nYou may also be eligible for a tax-free training bursary, payable in monthly installments during the course. This does not have to be repaid. Further details are available on the Get into Teaching Website.\r\n","aboutCourse":"If you are looking for a teacher training course in which you spend most of your time in-school while you study, this course may be for you.\r\nYou work with experienced teachers, first of all observing and team teaching, then teaching independently. This is complemented by a placement of about 6 weeks' teaching in another school plus various other visits. \r\n\r\nYour course will be based at St Mary's University and your Lead School. ","interviewProcess":"Candidates will normally be interviewed by St Mary's University and the Lead School. Interviews are structured into two parts - the first part of the interview will discuss with candidates their motivation for entry into the teaching profession. While the second half of the interview looks at the candidates understanding of the education system in England. As part of the interview candidates may be asked to teach a lesson of about 30 minutes to a class. Candidates may be asked to undertake a written task as part of the interview.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Candidates as part of the application process:\r\n* nominate a school to train within \r\n* the age range they wish to teach \r\nCandidates will spend the majority of their time within their nominated school but will also undertake, at least, a six week placement in a second school. The second school must be a contrasting school to their main school. \r\nRBTSA consists of some 30 schools which are a mixture of primary and secondary schools. This allows the Alliance to ensure that we are able to meet the needs of the candidates across a wide range of schools.\r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for applicants who have the potential to become outstanding teachers, and who are able to work independently on their studies while training in a school context. These personal attributes include:\r\n1. Subject knowledge \r\n2. Motivation to become the best teacher possible.\r\n3. Ability to analyse and learn from experience, and to act on feedback.\r\n4.

If you are offered a place, you will be asked to provide a signed declaration relating to any police record. Contact The Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School or St Mary's University office if you need guidance on whether an offence or conviction may preclude you from teaching.\r\nAll trainee teachers must also meet the Secretary of State's requirements for physical and mental health.
