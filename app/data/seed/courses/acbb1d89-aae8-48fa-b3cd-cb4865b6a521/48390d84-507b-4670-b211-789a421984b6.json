Salaried trainees do not pay tuition fees.  \r\n\r\nSuccessful applicants with The Hampshire SCITT Partnership will be subject to a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check at their own expense. Further information regarding this process will be provided to successful applicants.\r\n","aboutCourse":"This course is specifically for the Researchers in Schools programme. Researchers in Schools is a national programme that offers a tailored route into teaching exclusively for those who have completed a doctorate. It is designed to ensure that trainees are well equipped to deploy their knowledge and skills for the benefit of pupils in non-selective state schools through its three aims: to increase and disseminate subject expertise, to promote education research and to champion university access.  https://researchersinschools.org/\r\nFrom the very start of your training, you will be part of the teaching team in your school. Your programme will include training days across a number of schools in The Hampshire SCITT Partnership, training in your own school, subject specialist days led by outstanding practitioners and personalised training. \r\n\r\nMost of the training is delivered by practitioners in some of the best secondary schools in Hampshire.  You will be assigned to one of the schools in our partnership for most of your training (your ‘home’ school) and you will have a second school placement, typically six weeks, which will give your opportunities to extend your practice in a different setting.  We prepare our trainees to teach the 11-16 age range.  All our partnership schools have comprehensive intakes and you will be working with young people of all abilities.  \r\n\r\nStaff from the University of Winchester will prepare you for the three academic assignments, the successful completion of which is required for the award of a PGCE and you will have access to the University Library for your academic research. Each Friday will be dedicated to training in one of our partnership schools.  On those days, there will be opportunities for discussion, both formal and informal with practitioners and with your peers.  You will benefit from being part of a highly supportive, professional network.\r\n\r\nYou will be assigned two members of staff in your ‘home’ and second placement schools, one from your subject area and one who has responsibility for all the trainees in that school.   From the beginning you will be treated like a member of staff and you will attend staff meetings and professional development days.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Candidates invited to interview will participate in the following process:\r\n-\tAn interview with a panel typically comprised of the Director of The Hampshire SCITT Partnership and a subject specialist\r\n-\tA subject knowledge task to assess the candidate's subject knowledge against the requirements of the school curriculum \r\n-\tA literacy task\r\n-\tA teaching task (to a small group of pupils)\r\n-\tA presentation on a current educational topic\r\n\r\nThroughout this process, the emphasis is placed on generating a pleasant, informal and welcoming atmosphere in which candidates are able to gain as much information about the programme as they require in order to accept a place if it is offered subsequently.\r\n\r\n\r\nApplicants will be sent interview details in advance so they have plenty of time for preparation.
