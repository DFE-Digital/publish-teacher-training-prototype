Later in the year, students return to the University for additional full training weeks, but spend the majority of time (at least 120 days) in schools.\r\n\r\nThe Computing programme will focus predominantly on developing your subject knowledge and subject pedagogy so that you have the knowledge, understanding and skills needed to become a confident Computing teacher. University lead lectures and seminars will develop your confidence in a range of relevant issues; classroom and behaviour management; meeting individual needs and inclusion; planning and assessment etc. School – led sessions will also develop your understanding in key areas related to our school context. There is a strong emphasis on social justice issues in education and on mental health and well-being. We want you to develop into an inclusive and reflective teacher, with the skills, energy and resilience needed to make a real difference in schools.\r\nIn order to achieve Qualified Teacher Status, you will demonstrate that you are able to meet all the requirements of the Teachers’ Standards. This aspect of assessment is largely undertaken by our school-based mentors. LJMU staff are in regular contact with all trainees on placement, undertake co-observations of their teaching and Quality Assure the school-based training across the Partnership.\r\nThe Postgraduate Certificate is assessed through 2 Modules. The Award of QTS is integral to one of these academic Modules. You will also complete one essay, in two parts which asks you to reflect on your practice.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Applicants who meet the entry requirements will be interviewed by Archbishop Blanch school direct leaders aswell as representatives from our partner schools. \r\n\r\nThis process will involve a presentation, a teaching task and a written literacy/numeracy task. \r\n\r\nOur selection and interview procedure will also give applicants further information about our programmes.\r\n\r\nAn applicant's performance in each part of the selection process is assessed and final decision made, based on a judgement of interview performance. Any relevant prior experience and suitable references will also be considered.  Applicants are normally informed of decisions within 24 hours.\r\n\r\nApplicants are assessed on:\r\n•\tDepth of relevant subject knowledge and interest and enthusiasm for the subject\r\n•\tAbility to successfully engage learners and to make learning exciting and meaningful to young people from all backgrounds\r\n•\tCommitment to supporting learners, including in areas of challenging social context\r\n•\tEnthusiasm, energy and resilience and ability to work with others in teams\r\n•\tPotential to work successfully at Master’s level.\r\n\r\nApplicants are asked to send copies of evidence of GCSEs in English and Mathematics prior to interview, along with degree certificates if applicable.  \r\n\r\nWe are committed to developing a diverse teaching workforce, which reflects the diverse nature of pupils across the city and the schools in the partnership. \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Your school-based experience takes place largely in a Home School, supported by well- trained mentors. We have found that being in a Home School ensures that you are fully integrated into school life and get to know staff, pupils and your subject mentor extremely well, to the benefit of all involved. A member of LJMU staff is attached to each school and is responsible for visiting regularly in order to support all trainees and their mentors. \r\nAll trainees are entitled to weekly review and feedback meetings with their mentors and to tutorials with LJMU staff. This “wraparound” care ensures that you are consistently supported from start to finish, both personally and professionally.\r\nYou will be allocated to your Home School during Induction and every effort is made to select schools within reasonable travelling distance. Placements are selected from within the Archbishop Blanch Partnership of schools, which extend across a number of Liverpool schools who educate a diverse range of pupils from all faiths and backgrounds. All our partnership of schools are committed to student teacher development and to the link with LJMU. A range of mentor training and development events hosted both at LJMU and in school, ensure that our mentors understand our expectations and commit to offering high quality guidance and support to each trainee.\r\nIn addition to the time spent in a Home School, you will also undertake an alternative placement of roughly 6 weeks in a contrasting school between January and February. This placement has an explicit focus on diversity and inclusion. Additional experiences are also often provided for instance through visits to Special Schools and to Primary Schools. Although the programmes focus on 11-16 experience, many trainees also gain experience of Post 16 planning and teaching during their school experience.\r\nSchool experience is structured in Phases, beginning with an observation phase, so that you can develop appropriate confidence and competence, only taking on greater responsibility for planning and teaching as the year progresses. Your final assessment for QTS is conducted at the end of the year.\r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for applicants who have a passion for Computing and wish to share their passion with young people. You should have a genuine belief that education transforms life chances and want to make a positive difference to young people and to their communities. At interview we hope to see your enthusiasm along with evidence of some experiences which have informed your decision to become a teacher. A minimum of 5 days’ work experience in a UK secondary school is helpful prior to commencing the programme. We can help to arrange this for successful applicants.","otherRequirements":"","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:49:21.709Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-27T12:12:58.218Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2023"}
