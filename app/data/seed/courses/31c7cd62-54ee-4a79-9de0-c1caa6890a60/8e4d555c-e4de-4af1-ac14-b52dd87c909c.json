During this time they would be given a tour of the school and spend time talking to staff and pupils in classes. They would be interviewed by one of the Directors of the scheme and by a subject mentor. During the interview they would be asked, depending on their subject, to give a short presentation/speak in their foreign language/complete a subject specific test/deliver a short practical. \r\n\r\nIn addition, all candidates are asked to complete a generic, short written task and numeracy task.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Arrangements for teaching placements:\r\n- Associate teachers spend the first week of the course observing in a primary school (this is organised by the trainee at a school of their choice) \r\n- From the second week of the course Associate Teachers are based in one of the Partnership schools except for the ten weeks of their main block practice when they will be placed in one of the other schools in the Partnership. \r\n\r\nWe value the experiences that our Associate Teachers bring with them and we try to be flexible in meeting their particular needs when placing them in their host schools.\r\n\r\nIn order to find the most suitable placement for each trainee, we look at the distance they would have to travel from home to school, the age ranges they will be teaching and the availability of the most appropriate School Based Tutor.\r\n","personalQualities":"Associate Teachers are selected from a wide age range with a good balance of people in their 20s, 30s and 40s. Some will be straight from university; others may have had considerable experience of another career. A majority of our Associate Teachers come from within a 25 mile radius of the Partnership schools. \r\n\r\nSuccessful candidates are able to show:\r\n\r\n- A commitment to teaching which may be demonstrated by evidence of previous work with young people. \r\n\r\n- An ability to communicate effectively with pupils and with adults. \r\n\r\n- A genuine interest in sharing enthusiasm for their subject\r\n","otherRequirements":null,"status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:53:22.916Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-09T10:09:03.318Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"}
