You will have a weekly mentor meeting to allow you to discuss any issues and organise any support you may need.\r\n","interviewProcess":"We are looking for ambitious, forward-thinking, emotionally-intelligent and innovative trainee teachers who are passionate and enthusiastic about their subject and the prospect of working with young people of all abilities in a secondary school environment.

Opportunities will be provided for you to meet experienced teachers from your subject area and other trainee teachers. A representative from KMT will be involved throughout the day and the selection decision will be a joint decision between Mascalls Academy, your chosen school and KMT.\r\n\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will have a ‘Home’ school which is where you will spend the majority of your training year, between September and January, and Easter and June. You will be learning how to teach your subject by slowly building up to teaching full lessons and then building up your number of lessons. You will be supported by  a mixture of expert teachers.\r\n\r\nYou will also have a six-week placement in a contrasting school. For example, from a non selective to a Grammar School or a single-sex school to a mixed school. This will usually take place between February and Easter.\r\n\r\nIn April and May, you will be finally assessed through both lesson observations and your completed portfolio to ensure that you have met the Teachers’ Standards. If you are successful, your QTS award will be confirmed during our final Exam Board. \r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for ambitious, forward-thinking, emotionally-intelligent and innovative trainees who are passionate and enthusiastic about their subject and the prospect of working with young people of all abilities.
