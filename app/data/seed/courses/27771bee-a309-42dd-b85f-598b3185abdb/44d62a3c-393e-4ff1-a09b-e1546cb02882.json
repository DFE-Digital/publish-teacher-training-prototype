A representative from KMT will be involved throughout the day and the selection decision will be a joint decision between Mascalls Academy, your chosen school and KMT.\r\n\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will have a ‘Home’ school which is where you will spend the majority of your training year, between September and January, and Easter and June.

You will be supported by  a mixture of expert teachers.\r\n\r\nYou will also have a six-week placement in a contrasting school. For example, from a non selective to a Grammar School or a single-sex school to a mixed school.
