This is so you can begin working in July in those schools that offer an early start.

During the day interviewees will be observed teaching a 20-30 minute lesson to a group of pupils, will complete literacy and numeracy fundamentals along with a subject knowledge test.This will be followed by a formal interview. You will be informed in advance about the content of the lesson, the age group and the abilities of the pupils you will be teaching. Opportunities will be provided for you to meet experienced teachers from your subject area and other trainee teachers. A representative from KMT will be involved throughout the day and the selection decision will be a joint decision between Mascalls Academy, your chosen school and KMT.\r\n\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will have a ‘Home’ school which is where you will spend the majority of your training year, between September and January, and Easter and June. You will be learning how to teach your subject by slowly building up to teaching full lessons and then building up your number of lessons. You will be supported by  a mixture of expert teachers.\r\n\r\nYou will also have a six-week placement in a contrasting school. For example, from a non selective to a Grammar School or a single-sex school to a mixed school. This will usually take place between February and Easter.\r\n\r\nIn April and May, you will be finally assessed through both lesson observations and your completed portfolio to ensure that you have met the Teachers’ Standards. If you are successful, your QTS award will be confirmed during our final Exam Board. \r\n","personalQualities":"In order to train with us you must be:\r\n\r\n* passionate about your subject\r\n* resilient and resourceful \r\n* dedicated to educating and supporting young people\r\n* self-reflective\r\n* open to constructive criticism\r\n* professional\r\n* proactive\r\n* a strong communicator\r\n* be organised\r\n","otherRequirements":"Before the course begins, you will need:\r\n\r\n* at least 10 experience days in a secondary school or academy (if School and Government Guidelines allow)\r\n* at least 2 experience days in a primary school or academy (if School and Government Guidelines allow)\r\n* DBS check\r\n* Health check declaration\r\n\r\nIt is useful to attend at least one school experience day or informal chat with a school representative before applying so that you can get a feel for the chosen school and what it can offer as a training placement.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:52:22.841Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-19T07:58:59.093Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2023"}
