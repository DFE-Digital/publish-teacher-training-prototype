You will also have a six-week placement which will offer you the opportunity to teach in the alternative Key Stage.\r\n\r\nYou will be in schools for four days a week where you will be involved in observations, teaching, staff training, parents’ evenings, school meetings, extra-curricular clubs: all the facets of a teacher’s school life. On Thursdays, you will have your pedagogical training with KMT that provides a mixture of subject specific sessions and more general ones which have a holistic approach to educational practices. After Easter, you will be in school four and a half days, KMT training will still take place on Thursday afternoons until the end of May.\r\nYou will be supported by a network of established professionals, including a school base mentor, your KMT Lead Mentors and Course Directors as well as the other teachers and trainees in your school. You will have a weekly mentor meeting to allow you to discuss the progress you have made and the support you might need to develop your practice effectively.\r\n\r\nTo begin the year, you will observe lessons, developing into leading small parts of a lesson or working with small groups, and building until you are teaching 70% of a full timetable by the end of the course. You will be supernumerary, meaning there will always be with a qualified teacher in the room with you. You will be formally observed once a week in order to receive constructive feedback that will help you develop into an effective teacher.\r\nAs well as your teaching, you will be working on charting your development and recording your skills through a Progress Tracker and Reflective Practice Assignments. At the late stage of your training, you are being assessed against the 8 Teachers Standards. \r\nIn addition, for those wishing to obtain the Professional Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) as well as Qualified Teacher Status (QTS), you will be able to top up your qualification by paying an extra fee and completing additional assignments if you decide to complete the Evidence Informed Practice offered through distance learning with Leeds Beckett University.\r\n","interviewProcess":"A structured interview forms a core part of the recruitment process and will involve the placement school as well KMT representation.\r\nA training provision checklist will be provided to candidates prior to the interview for them to read through.
