You will also have a three-week placement in a contrasting school to help to broaden your experience.\r\n\r\nYou will be in schools for at least four days a week where you will be involved in observations, teaching, staff training, parents’ evenings, school meetings, extra-curricular clubs: all the facets of a teacher’s school life. On Thursdays, you will have your pedagogical training with KMT that provides a mixture of specific Subject Studies, looking at aspects of teaching your specialism, and the more general Professional Studies sessions, which have a holistic approach to educational practices. After Easter, you will be in school full time.\r\n\r\nYou will be supported by a network of established professionals, including a subject mentor in your school, usually a subject specialist, your professional tutor, your KMT lead mentor and course director as well as the other teachers and trainees in your school. You will have a weekly mentor meeting to allow you discuss any issues and organise any  support you may need.\r\n\r\nYou will have your own classes and an established timetable. You will focus on teaching KS3 and KS4 but may also get the opportunity to teach some KS5. You will be formally observed once a week in order to receive feedback and make progress.\r\n\r\nAs well as your teaching, you will be working on charting you development and recording your skills through progress trackers, Reflective Professional Journals (RPJs), and collecting evidence to prove you are working towards meeting the Teachers’ Standards. These are spread across the year and you will be supported by your mentor and your lead subject mentor.\r\n\r\nIn addition, for those wishing to obtain the Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) as well as Qualified Teacher Status (QTS), you will be able to top up your qualification by paying an extra fee and completing other assignments throughout the year through distance learning with the University of Leeds Beckett.\r\n","interviewProcess":"The interview process varies slightly across the schools in the alliance; however, once you have applied by UCAS, if your application is strong, you are likely to be invited into the school to observe some lessons in your subject and meet some of the teachers.\r\n\r\nIf interested in pursuing the training placement, you will be interviewed by a representative from Kent and Medway Training, the school's Professional Tutor and a teacher from your chosen subject. This will include you presenting a plan for a lesson which will be defined for you before the interview. You will be asked to talk through your plan so to demonstrate your subject knowledge and ability to turn that into stimulating activities for young people. There will also be other questions to ascertain your resilience and dedication to teaching. At the same time, you will be asked to sit the KMT entrance test.\r\n\r\nIf all the panel members agree to offering you a training placement, you will be offered a conditional offer. If you are not successful, there may be the possibility that you will be offered a place at one of the other alliance schools if they have availability.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will have a ‘home’ school which is where you will spend the majority of your training year. Here, you will be learning how to teach your subject by teaching classes, getting weekly feedback and weekly pedagogical sessions at KMT. You will be supported by other members of your department, your mentor and your Professional Tutor.\r\n\r\nYou will also have a three-week placement in a contrasting school. For example, from a High School to a Grammar School or a single-sex school to a co-educational school. This will usually take place between February and Easter but may happen after the exam classes have left later in the year.\r\n\r\nIn April and May, you will be finally assessed through both lesson observation and your completed portfolio to ensure that you have met the Teachers’ Standards. The grades are then externally moderated and, if all the elements are completed to a good standard, your Newly-Qualified Teacher (NQT) status is confirmed and celebrated at a local hub-centred Awards Evening.\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"In order to train with us you must be:\r\n\r\n* passionate about your subject\r\n* resilient\r\n* independent\r\n* dedicated to educating and supporting young people\r\n* self-reflective\r\n* open to constructive criticism\r\n* professional\r\n* proactive\r\n* a strong communicator\r\n","otherRequirements":"School Direct Salaried is primarily aimed at career changers with three or more years’ work experience. Before the course begins, you will need:\r\n\r\n* at least 10 experience days in a secondary school or academy\r\n* at least 2 experience days in a primary school or academy\r\n* DBS check\r\n* Health check declaration\r\n\r\nIt is useful to attend at least one school experience day before application so that you can get a feel for the chosen school and what it can offer as a training placement.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:53:50.603Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-06T07:50:51.261Z","canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","cycle":"2024","salaryDetails":"Salaried Trainees are paid according to the Unqualified Teacher Pay Scale.\r\nThe school will cover your fees to KMT for QTS.\r\nIf you wish to complete the PGCE there is an additional cost of £1,800.\r\n"}
