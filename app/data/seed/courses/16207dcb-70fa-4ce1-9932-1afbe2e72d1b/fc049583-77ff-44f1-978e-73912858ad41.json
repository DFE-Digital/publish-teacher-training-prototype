The candidate is able to train with children of different ages and can choose a Key Stage 1 or Key Stage 2 training programme. \r\nThe course consists of weekly observations by a school based mentor (SBM) and observations by an e-Qualitas representative a few times a term. \r\nThe candidate will need to build a portfolio of evidence to meet the Teaching Standards throughout the year. The candidate will have the opportunity to train for a period of time in a different school setting and a different Key Stage.\r\n\r\nIdentify the age range you think you would like to focus on during the training\r\nThe options are:\r\n•\tAges 3 to 7 ie Nursery and Reception (Early Years) and Years 1 and 2 (Key Stage 1)\r\n•\tAges 5 to 9 ie Years 1 to 4 inclusive (Key Stage 1 and lower Key Stage 2)\r\n•\tAges 7 to 11 ie Years 3 to 6 inclusive (Key Stage 2)\r\n\r\nVisiting primary schools will give you an insight into the teacher’s role, and help you decide whether you are more suited to teaching the younger or the older pupils. A good choice is the middle age range ie Years 1 to 4 inclusive, as you have to know about Early Years and about upper Key Stage 2 although during your training you concentrate on teaching Key Stage 1 and lower Key Stage 2. \r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"You are asked to plan and teach a half hour lesson with a story focus in a class.
