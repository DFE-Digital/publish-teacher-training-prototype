You will be trained in a highly professional and supportive environment and will develop the skills, knowledge and expertise that will enable you to plan and deliver engaging learning experiences for pupils of all abilities and dispositions.\r\n\r\nTrainees are based in schools from the first day of term and spend the majority of their time in a school environment in order to learn hands on.\r\n\r\nThe training modules cover: planning learning; managing pupils’ behaviour; assessing learning; learning for all including high-attainers, EAL, those with special educational needs; overcoming barriers to learning; the organisation of the curriculum and cross-curricular issues; effective teaching of the subject. There are two assignments: one on learning for all, one on effective subject teaching.\r\n\r\nYou will receive training from both e-Qualitas and across our network of schools on areas such as lesson planning, behaviour for learning, assessment and progress, giving you a wider perspective on aspects of pedagogy and beyond. \r\n\r\nAssessment is on-going, with self-assessment, 5-weekly assessment points for the in-school trainers’ assessments and feedback, and tutor assessments. The final assessment for QTS is verified by an eQ tutor who has not been previously involved in the trainee’s training.\r\n\r\nThroughout all of this you will receive support both in school, from your subject mentor and professional tutor.","interviewProcess":"As you have chosen a specific school which you would like to train within our alliance you will be interviewed at that school.  On the interview panel will be  a member of the Three Rivers Teaching School Alliance, the subject leader and possible a member of the senior leadership team.\r\n\r\nIf the school place you have applied to gets filled, you may be asked to attend an interview at another school instead.\r\n\r\nThe interview process will consist of planning and teaching a 20 minute lesson, an individual interview and in some cases a subject knowledge test.\r\n\r\nEnglish and Mathematics skills tests are no longer required. \r\nAssessments of English and Mathematics knowledge will be made at interview.\r\n\r\nIf the applicant is successful, the school’s feedback enables e-Qualitas to make a conditional offer of a place. This is confirmed after the necessary conditions have been met, and an e-Qualitas tutor has visited the school. The tutor checks that the applicant is indeed suitable for entry to initial teacher training, checks that the school will make appropriate arrangements for the in-school training, and works out the individualised training plan.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"If you are successful you will be assigned to the school which you have applied (or an alternative as discussed at interview if this place is full). \r\n\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"Evidence of an interest and enthusiasm for teaching young people.\r\n\r\nStrong specialist knowledge of the subject you wish to teach.\r\n\r\nSchool experience is essential if you are interested in becoming a teacher. Before you apply for teacher training, it is advisable to gain as much experience in the classroom as possible. Spending time in a classroom is the ideal way to strengthen your application. School experience gives you the chance to watch lessons and see for yourself what it’s really like to be a teacher – and allows you to draw on your own examples in your application and interview.\r\n\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"You will be required to undergo a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check to verify your suitability for working with children and young people.\r\n\r\nExperience within a school in the last 2 years is favourable.","status":2,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:53:00.551Z","canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","cycle":"2024"}
