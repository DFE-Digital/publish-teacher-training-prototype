The course will run from September 2021 – December 2022 and trainees will train three days a week (Wednesday – Friday). \r\n\r\nThe course has three key elements:\r\n\r\nSchool-based training\r\n\r\nFrom the first day in September, trainees commence their training within their employing school, enabling them to become an integral part of the teaching team and quickly form strong relationships with colleagues, pupils and parents/carers. They will spend time in school each week, working alongside an experienced teacher tutor who will provide daily coaching and support.  This school experience is complemented further by a second placement in a contrasting setting and key stage.\r\n\r\nAs a salaried trainee and employee of the school, trainees may be given some class responsibility as the course progresses. This is great experience and is always carefully managed to ensure that a good balance between training and teaching is maintained.\r\n\r\nCentre-based training\r\n\r\nIn addition to the school-based training, all trainees will attend weekly core training sessions which take place in a range of venues across the partnership on Fridays. These sessions provide a coherent, well-sequenced programme, which meets the statutory requirements of the Core Content Framework.  \r\n\r\nPart-time trainees will attend the same sessions as the full-time trainees to help them feel part of the main cohort and to give them equal opportunities to benefit from peer support and the sharing of ideas and good practice. \r\n\r\nAcademic Study\r\n\r\nTrainees are also required to complete two QTS assignments, which help to embed key aspects of the core curriculum and support their development towards the Teachers’ Standards.\r\n\r\nThe assessment of trainees forms an important part of the programme, as it enables trainees to reflect on how well they are mastering the core curriculum and gaining proficiency in fundamental skills in English and maths. Ongoing formative assessments are embedded within the programme, helping trainees to identify their strengths and areas for development at all stages of their training.  \r\n \r\nTowards the end of the programme (December 2022), trainees are assessed against the Teachers’ Standards and after demonstrating that they are meeting these requirements, a recommendation is made for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).  \r\n\r\nGreat care has been taken to ensure that evidence collection is both purposeful and manageable.\r\n","interviewProcess":"It is our aim to recruit the highest quality applicants into the profession who have the capacity to become strong teachers.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, we carry out a rigorous three or four-stage selection process.\r\n\r\n(Due to the current circumstances, recruitment is being carried out remotely, via video conferencing.)\r\n\r\nStage 1: An application sift is carried out by course leaders to check for minimum academic requirements as well as strong references. To enable your application to be processed more quickly, please ensure you include a full work history, with no gaps.\r\n\r\nStage 2: Applicants are invited to attend a (virtual) selection day, where they will take part in a range of activities including maths and English tasks as well as a short presentation linked to a lesson idea.\r\n\r\nStage 3: Formal interview\r\n\r\nThis interview lasts approximately 20 minutes and consists of a series of questions which enable the applicant to share more information about their previous experience and to elaborate on the skills they can bring to the profession.\r\n\r\nIf an applicant on the School Direct (salaried) programme is being considered for a partnership school with which they have no prior links, a further visit / interview is likely to be arranged.  This is usually conducted by the headteacher (either remotely or in person) who will make the final decision.\r\n\r\nFollowing a successful interview, a conditional offer is made. This offer is conditional on the applicant obtaining any pending qualifications, an Enhanced DBS check and a 'Fit to Teach' health assessment.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Generally, trainees will have two school placements during the course: a main placement and a second placement.\r\n\r\nMain Placement: This is the trainee’s employing school in which the trainee will spend most of their time.  By remaining with the same class for the majority of the first year, trainees develop a secure understanding of pupils' progress over time, how this is tracked and used to inform future teaching. During the first three terms (year 1), trainees will typically spend two days in school and 1 day (Friday) at core training. In the fourth term, trainees will have completed the centre-based training and will therefore remain in school for the full three days, as they approach final assessment. \r\n \r\nSecond Placement: \r\nDuring the first year, a second placement will take place in the summer term (May-July), giving trainees the opportunity to experience a contrasting setting and different key stage. \r\n\r\nSecond placement familiarisation days provide trainees with an opportunity to spend time in their new school, prior to the placement commencing. This enables trainees to familiarise themselves with the school's ethos, routines and planning and form strong relationships with colleagues,  helping them to maximise their progress during this short but vital phase of training.\r\n\r\nEnhancement Visits: These visits are built into our core training programme, giving trainees regular opportunity to spend time in different schools and settings, enabling them teach in a wide range of contexts. Enhancement visits focus on specific areas such as behaviour management, Pupil Premium, Special Educational Needs (SEND) and transition from KS2 to KS3.  However, in support of our personalised training programme, training managers can arrange additional visits, if a trainee has a specific interest they would like to pursue.  \r\n\r\nBourton Meadow arranges placements on behalf of trainees. When selecting schools, we consider a wide range of factors including geographical location, preferred key stage, type of school, previous experience, chosen course etc.  However, we are also able to accommodate requests for a specific school (with the Headteacher's agreement) if an applicant already has a link with the school.\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"We aim to recruit individuals who can:\r\n\r\n- demonstrate a passion for teaching and a genuine concern for children's welfare\r\n- demonstrate good subject knowledge, particularly in maths and English\r\n- communicate clearly and accurately in standard English\r\n- show resilience and perseverance\r\n- manage time effectively and work well under pressure\r\n- proactively seek opportunities to enhance their training\r\n- form positive relationships with individuals from all walks of life \r\n- support the values, attitudes and ethos of our partnership schools\r\n- maintain high standard of professionalism \r\n- reflect on their own practice and act upon advice received\r\n","otherRequirements":"\r\nSalaried trainees are required to undergo a:\r\n\r\n- Fit to Teach health assessment\r\n\r\n- Enhanced DBS check\r\n\r\n- Prohibition Check\r\n\r\nIt is the responsibility of the employing school to meet these requirements.\r\n\r\nWork experience is not a requirement of the course and applications will still be considered from candidates without this experience. However, the salaried route is a very competitive route into teacher training. Relevant work experience will often strengthen the applicant's performance at a selection day, thus demonstrating their capacity to take on the additional rigour and responsibility of a salaried placement.\r\n","status":2,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:48:43.685Z","canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","cycle":"2024"}
