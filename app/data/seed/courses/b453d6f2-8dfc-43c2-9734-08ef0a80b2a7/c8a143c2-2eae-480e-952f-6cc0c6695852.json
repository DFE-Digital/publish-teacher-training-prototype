You will observe expert colleagues and embody the qualities and role of a teacher. On the fifth day you will undertake study sessions as a Secondary cohort. These sessions cover key teaching theories, strategies, policies and approaches. In addition, you will break into subject specialisms to explore the themes of your subject in greater depth. \r\n\r\nAll PE trainees are required to gain some experience teaching a second subject to increase their employability at the end of the programme. (PE teaching is a very competitive employment field.)

The difference between these routes is that the PGCE earns a trainee 60 Master credits alongside their QTS, essays are written with an academic focus. The QTS route still includes essay writing but this is rooted in classroom practice and reflection. Our PGCE is accredited by Kingston University but all delivery takes place within our training programme and there is no need for trainees to attend the University at any time. You will have access to all the online library and support systems remotely. \r\n","interviewProcess":"Our interview process will include the following: \r\n\r\n* formal interview\r\n\r\n*a presentation that you will be asked to prepare in advance of the day\r\n\r\n* a group task focused on learning \r\n\r\nThis interview panel is likely to comprise of two members of the SCITT team but may also include a member of staff from one of our partner schools. \r\n\r\nPrior to the interview we will send you details on how to complete our fundamental Maths and English test. \r\n\r\n[More information on what we are looking for from candidates can be found on our website](www.georgeabbottraining.co.uk)\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Successful candidates will be placed in a main placement school.
