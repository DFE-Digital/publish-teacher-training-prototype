Throughout the course, we place particular emphasis on providing equal opportunities for all students working in a diverse, multi-ethnic society.\r\nThis course will provide you with a PGCE at Masters level and Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). Working closely with Bradford specialist staff, both in placement schools, you will gain the knowledge, skills and understanding needed to be a newly qualified teacher.\r\nA strength of the course is the way in which theory and practice are related as a result of extensive time spent working with children in at least two placement schools.\r\nAt least 120 days are school-based with support provided by experienced school mentors.\r\nThe course builds upon the subject knowledge and independent study skills which, as a graduate, you will have already acquired. Our school-based sessions are also concerned with the professional skills which all teachers need. Course tutors work closely with leaders, mentors and teachers in our school to provide you with advice and support for the progressive development of your teaching expertise.\r\n\r\nA large proportion of your teaching and training will be in our school, delivered by both highly experienced, inspiring school teachers and leaders. School based sessions consist of lectures, seminars tutorials, micro-teaching environments and observations of teaching in school.   This is very much a practical course, where you learn by doing.\r\nAssessment is ongoing and is carried out across both placement schools.  At the end of the course, you will ultimately be assessed against the Teacher Standards.   Based largely in your home school, you will have one other main assessed school placement.  You will also have the opportunity to get experience of a primary, alternative provision or special school.\r\n","interviewProcess":"All our trainees who are shortlisted for interview will be invited into our school or one of our partner schools.  If you are asked for interview, we will provide more details about tasks you will be asked to complete.\r\nAll our interviews have the same elements:\r\n1. A classroom based exercise, where you will be observed interacting with children or young people. (Please note if current restrictions continue this activity will be adapted) \r\n2. Written tasks which are designed to assess your written communication skills; your ability to be numerate; your capacity to access higher level study; and for secondary applicants, subject knowledge.\r\n3. Face to face interview with a panel of School Leaders.\r\nDBS\r\nIf you are successful at interview stage, you will be made an offer of a training place subject to satisfactory enhanced DBS clearance. For more information, see the guidance on line at;\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/disclosure-barring-service-check\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We carefully consider school placements for all of our trainees.  We match strengths as well as support needs for students. All trainees will be placed in two contrasting primary schools, ensuring students experience the cultural diversity the city offers.  \r\n100% of our 2020/21 secondary trainees placements, located in our partnership schools, are within 10 miles of the school they applied to. \r\nThe average commute, the distance between the placement school & the school they applied to for a secondary trainee is under 2 miles. \r\nYour training week initially involves some days a week in school and some days working on teaching pedagogy, helping you learn the skills to make you an effective teacher.  During your training year you will visit a vast array of secondary schools from our partnership.  You will also visit primary and alternative provision.   We operate an A B A model for our students, where trainees start in their host school working with pupils that are aged 11 to 16, then complete an 6 week contrasting placement, then return to their host school to complete the training year. You will also experience working with students aged 16 to 18. \r\nThe course builds upon the subject knowledge and independent study skills which, as a graduate, you will have already acquired. Our school-based sessions are also concerned with the professional skills all teachers need. Course tutors work closely with managers, mentors and teachers in our schools and academies to provide you with advice and support for the progressive development of your teaching expertise. \r\nA large proportion of your teaching and training will be in our schools and academies, delivered by both highly experienced, inspiring school teachers and leaders.

Teaching is a creative, dynamic profession which has space for innovative thinking, for people who can break free from what's expected. Our school is clear that we want trainees to have a rapport with children, a passion for their subject, and to have the ambition to become excellent teachers. You will have a relentlessly positive outlook, show initiative and be good team player, ready to work hard in a challenging but wonderfully rewarding profession.","otherRequirements":"If you are successful at interview stage, you will be made an offer of a training place subject to satisfactory enhanced DBS clearance.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:54:58.292Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-30T13:33:25.215Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2024"}
