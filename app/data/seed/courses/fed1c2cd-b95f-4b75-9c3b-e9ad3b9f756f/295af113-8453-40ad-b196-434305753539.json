We will help students to acquire the skills and expertise to support children’s learning, prepare them to teach in an inclusive urban environment, provide professional development in all national curriculum subjects and ensure that students show a concern for professional values and demonstrate the positive attitudes and behaviour expected from pupils. This programme will prepare students for the award of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) in line with the requirements of the Teachers’ Standards (2012). UCL works in partnership with around 200 primary schools to enable Primary PGCE students to fully prepare to be a primary teacher. The programme is rated ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted (2013).\r\n\r\nStudents on the Primary PGCE programme benefit enormously from the complementary skills and expertise of staff in partnership schools and at the UCL Institute of Education (IOE). The schools offer placements for teaching experience, and their teachers serve as tutors, mentors and joint assessors for our student teachers.\r\n\r\nPrimary PGCE students can gain experience of teaching across one or more key stages; the Foundation Stage and Key Stage 1; Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2; lower Key Stage 2 (ages 7 to 9) and upper Key Stage 2 (ages 9 to 11). Students will learn to teach all the primary curriculum subjects. They will also select one subject for specialist study from the range that we offer (i.e. Literacy, MFL, Geography, Mathematics, Music, Computing, Science and Art & Design)\r\n\r\nThe programme consists of three core modules, two at Master’s-level (level 7), a Teaching and Learning module and a specialism module, and one at Undergraduate-level (level 6), plus three school placements. The programme is delivered via a combination of lectures, workshops, tutorials and self-study. Students will be supported though a virtual learning environment and will participate in school placements. Assessment is through assignments, presentations, audits, feedback and tutorials. A final assessment is based on a range of evidence including observations of teaching, assignments, subject knowledge development, professional conduct and responses to self-study.\r\n\r\nAs part of the programme students will spend time on placements at schools or Early Years settings, during which time their teaching experience will be supported by a tutor and mentor. Students will spend upto 120 days on placements.\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Candidates whose application form shows that they meet our short-listing criteria will be invited to an Interview Day. \r\n\r\nThe selection process will usually involve: \r\n\r\n*A classroom-based task \r\n*Time with staff/departments \r\n*A formal interview \r\n*A written task \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will spend the majority of time in your main placement school but will also be required to carry out a 2nd placement at another school which is usually for a period of 6 weeks.  \r\n\r\nYour 2nd placement will provide you with an excellent opportunity to compare and contrast different approaches to all aspects of teaching.\r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for inspiring, knowledgeable and ambitious trainee teachers who are passionate and enthusiastic about their school phase and/or subject specialism and have a desire to share this and make a real difference to young people's lives and futures.  \r\n","otherRequirements":"\r\n*Satisfactory clearance fro​m the DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service)\r\n*Completion of the Fitness to Teach requirement\r\n\r\n","status":2,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:46:59.717Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2024"}
