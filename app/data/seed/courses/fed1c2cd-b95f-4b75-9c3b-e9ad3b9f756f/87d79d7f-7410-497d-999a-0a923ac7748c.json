We are committed to providing the highest quality professional learning for trainee teachers, supporting them to have the biggest impact in the classroom and providing an excellent foundation for a successful career in education. Across our network, we devote more time to teaching core subjects, like maths, so that all our pupils have a solid grounding before they tackle the broader curriculum.\r\n\r\nOver the year you will have regular training sessions which are focused on how to be a great teacher of maths. During these sessions, we will cover a range of teaching approaches to mathematics and you will have the chance to share resources and ideas between your own school and other partner schools. By collaborating like this, all our teachers have great support, and all our pupils receive the best possible education.","interviewProcess":"","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Your training school - in London, will be matched to your particular profile as a candidate, while taking into account your commuting distance and funding/subject preferences (and availability on our programme, which changes as we move through the recruitment cycle).\r\n\r\nBecause of Covid-19 restrictions and pressures on schools regarding external visitors, you may not be able to visit your school before accepting an offer there. However, please be assured that schools are equally as keen to invite you to visit in person and will work with you to arrange this as soon as they can (most likely after your DBS check has been completed).\r\n\r\nThe training programme itself is 100% school-based, but you will come out of school to spend a half day every week in a session with your Ark tutor and other trainees from the network.\r\n\r\nYou’ll also obtain experience in different schools throughout the year; you will have a three week placement in a different school to your own, and will also have the opportunity to visit other educational settings.","status":1,"createdAt":"2022-01-06T09:49:55.027Z","updatedAt":"2022-01-06T12:45:44.994Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2024","applicationsOpenDateOther":"2022-02-01T00:00:00.000Z"}
