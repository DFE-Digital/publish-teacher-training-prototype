They will draw on eQualitas' distance learning resources for independent study, and attend some training days in central London. \r\n\r\nApprentices have a visiting tutor from eQualitas, who spend a day in school each half term to observe them teaching, provide some training, review their developing evidence and assess their progress so that helpful targets are set for the apprentice's next steps. Assessment for QTS takes place towards the end of the training programme and QTS is awarded (if the Teachers' Standards are met). \r\n\r\nAfter 12 months, the apprentice has to pass the end-point assessment which checks whether he or she is maintaining and further developing what was attained in the QTS assessment.","interviewProcess":"Candidates whose application form shows that they meet our short-listing criteria will be invited to an Interview Day. \r\n\r\nThe selection process will usually involve: \r\n\r\n*A classroom-based task \r\n*Time with staff/departments \r\n*A formal interview \r\n*A written task \r\n\r\nWe recommend that you aim to gain some experience in a classroom prior to interview.
