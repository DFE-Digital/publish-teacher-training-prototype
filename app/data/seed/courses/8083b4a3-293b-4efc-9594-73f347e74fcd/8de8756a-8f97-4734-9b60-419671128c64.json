The SBT will be based in the trainee’s home school. The SBT works closely with the trainee in school on a daily basis; carrying out lesson observations, setting training targets and helping to organise in-school training opportunities which will enhance and develop the trainee’s practice. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":" - A commitment to teaching as a career\r\n - Build relationships with children to promote their learning\r\n - An understanding of early years and primary education\r\n - Understand the role of an early years and primary teacher\r\n - Work cooperatively and effectively with people from a diverse society\r\n - An understanding of the complexity to study at Masters Degree level\r\n - Work on own initiative and manage workload\r\n - Clear and accurate written and verbal communication\r\n - IT confidence and competency\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"- A Clear Criminal Record \r\n- An Enhanced DBS Certificate\r\n- The right to train and/or work in the UK\r\n- Good Health\r\n- Satisfactory References\r\n\r\nA full career history accounting for any gaps in employment will be required if you are invited to interview and references will be followed up for safeguarding purposes. \r\n\r\nSuccessful applicants must be willing to undergo an Enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service check.\r\n\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:53:24.682Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-01T09:29:02.954Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2024"}
