Students' wellbeing is paramount and our cohorts always work well together due to pre course induction days and the opportunity to observe eachother during the year. \r\nAs part of the assessment, students will present an overview of their learning at the university. We ensure students are well prepared for this during a two day residential at Linden Hall where presentations are completed along with practice interviews and guidance on the application process.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Due to the current lockdown, the interviews will take place via an online platform and may include a representative from Northumbria University along with someone from the Beech Hill partnership.\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Our partnership of around 15 schools is led by Beech Hill Primary School; a National Support School with an excellent track record of school improvement.
