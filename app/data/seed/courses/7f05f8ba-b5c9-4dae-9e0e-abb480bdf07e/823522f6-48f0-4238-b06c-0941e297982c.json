Your placements run for the whole training year, with 1 day per week at university.","personalQualities":"We are looking for confident, knowledgeable and enthusiastic people who will be classroom practitioners currently or in the near future.

Candidates offered a place on a School Direct course will be asked to complete an enhanced check with the DBS to ensure they do not have a criminal background which might prevent them from working as a teacher.  This must be completed before you register on the programme.","status":2,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:44.433Z","canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","cycle":"2023","salaryDetails":"UQ1"}
