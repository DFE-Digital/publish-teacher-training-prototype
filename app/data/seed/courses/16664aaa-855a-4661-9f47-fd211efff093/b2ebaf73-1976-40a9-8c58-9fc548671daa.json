Within the School Direct route trainees get the opportunity to learn ‘on the job’, but shouldn’t be worried about being thrown in at the deep end. Inspire trainees are part of a team that supports each other and they receiving intensive guidance and mentoring from experienced teachers and leaders. As a family of schools, we work together to provide the best quality of support and experience as trainees learn the art of teaching and develop practice within the classroom. \r\n\r\nInspire Partnership are able to offer both the salaried and unsalaried training route of School Direct Programmes and our programmes are run in partnership with Goldsmiths University. Places for trainees are available at our schools in both Greenwich and Medway. All prospective candidates will need to go through an application and interview process with the Inspire Partnership. Once successful trainees are placed in one of our schools (working in an EYFS, KS1 or KS2 class) they will split their time working in school, training at university, participating in school-based professional development sessions, and visiting and sharing with other trainees across our partnership. \r\n\r\nWorking Alongside Goldsmiths\r\nEnrolling into the Inspire Partnership Schools Direct programme will involve undertaking training with Goldsmiths, University of London, who deliver a comprehensive training programme designed to complement all training and guidance offered in schools.

Trainees will receive comprehensive training and guidance to support them with these academic submissions as well as dedicated practical support each day within their host schools.
