For example, online courses tend to be slightly cheaper because they use fewer facilities.\r\n\r\nThe most up-to-date fees will be listed on the course page – search for your course on our website and look for the section on fees.\r\n\r\nThe fees are slightly different depending on whether you normally live in the UK/EU or outside of the EU.\r\n","financialSupport":"To pay for your tuition fees and living costs, you may be able to take out a student loan. These loans don’t usually need to be paid back until you have graduated and are earning a good salary.\r\n\r\nSometimes, bursaries and scholarships are also available - it depends on your circumstances and which country you usually live in. These don’t need to be paid back.\r\n\r\nPlease visit our website for more information or call our helpline on 01332 592000. \r\n","aboutCourse":"From the beginning of the academic year, you will be a full member of the Religious Education department in your school and engage in all areas of school and department life.\r\n\r\nYou will be based in your school 4 days a week where you will gradually build up your teaching time, observe examples of best practice, participate in tutor group activities and wider professional development.

The hub sessions have a strong focus on classroom based teaching and learning with lots of practical ideas for you to take away and use.\r\n\r\nYou will also have subject based sessions with other trainees in your subject area within the alliance.  These are led by an experienced practising classroom teacher to explore the best teaching and learning approaches in Religious Education.","interviewProcess":"We have a thorough interview process to ensure that we are matching potential trainees to the right schools and departments. \r\n\r\nOur interviews involve:\r\n\r\n* tour of the school\r\n* a short teaching task\r\n* numeracy and literacy assessments \r\n* and a formal interview with a 5 minute presentation\r\n\r\nFull details are provided prior to the interview.\r\n\r\nGetting to know trainees background and prior experience has ensured that our placements are successful with 100% retention and completion rates.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"All trainees are allocated a main placement school which they are based in during the Autumn and Summer term.
