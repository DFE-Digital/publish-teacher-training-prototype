We provide a unique opportunity across Norfolk and Suffolk for trainees to immerse themselves in a diverse range of teaching and training experiences which by the final term are highly personalised.\r\n\r\nThe training comprises of 3 placements in 2 contrasting schools over the course of the year combined with 66 days in centre training. \r\n\r\nThe centre based training is provided by expert trainers, many of whom are still serving teachers. It covers all National Curriculum subjects and key aspects of primary education such as behaviour management, SEND and assessment. Trainees also have sessions focused on the two assignments and one presentation which contribute to their PGCE qualification (including 60 credits at M Level).\r\n\r\nAll trainees have a personal tutor who is committed to supporting each trainee over their training year.  This includes weekly email contact, visits to observe teaching and end of term progress interviews. Ofsted 2013 commented on the ‘very high-quality pastoral and academic support for trainees which results in outstanding outcomes’. \"\r\n","interviewProcess":"The Primary Tuition SCITT team will be co-ordinating the recruitment process with their partnership school head teachers. At Consortium Academy Debbie Thomas leads the interview process for both tuition and salaried routes.  You will lead a 10-minute teaching activity in a partnership school. If this this is successful, you will be invited to attend a task day.\r\n\r\nAt the task day you will undertake some short written tests and some interpersonal tasks. This will be followed by an interview.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Our partnership of over 150 schools is well-established and we have clear and strong working relationships with a range of primary schools across Suffolk and Norfolk and into Cambridgeshire. We go to great lengths through quality assurance and our local knowledge to ensure that all placements are of a high standard. Trainees are supported by school mentors who are enthusiastic, committed and well-trained individuals. \r\nTrainees spend approximately 26 weeks on school placement. Most of this is in the main placement school in the autumn and summer terms, with at least 6 weeks in the spring term in a contrasting school.\r\n\r\nThe distance to school placements will vary. These take into account the trainee’s home address, whether they have their own transport and the placement that the school is able to offer. Our policy is to endeavour to keep journey times to school to a maximum of 50 minutes each way.\r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for committed, resilient individuals who are ready to undertake an exciting but rigorous training year. We are interested in people who are passionate and enthusiastic about children's learning and have a desire to promote the best outcomes for children of all abilities. You need to be open to constructive feedback and see it as a tool to help you to achieve your potential by the end of the year.  You must be organised and self-motivated as although there is lots of support, you also need to be focused on the commitment involved within this training year.  ","otherRequirements":"A satisfactory enhanced DBS check before commencing training. Suffolk and Norfolk SCITT will arrange this.\r\n\r\nIf an applicant has lived overseas for more than six months in the past five years in line with safer recruitment practice they will be required to provide a certificate of good conduct from that country.\r\n\r\nApplicants must pass the professional skills tests for literacy and numeracy before the start of the course.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:57:15.792Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-17T10:00:30.301Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2023"}
