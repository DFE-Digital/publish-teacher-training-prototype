The school-based apprenticeship is underpinned by a structured taught course which provides deep insight into the required subject knowledge and the appropriate pedagogy to inspire effective learning in children and young people and secure progress across the primary subjects. The Ripley SCITT apprenticeship programme begins with an intensive, centrally delivered induction in July and focuses on core aspects of the school curriculum which includes features of effective learning and teaching; how children learn and how teachers facilitate learning; behaviour management; pupil assessment; planning effective learning for all children, including those with special needs (SEND); English as an additional language (EAL); and planning differentiated learning that meets all young learners’ needs.\r\n\r\nDuring the weekly centre-based time there will be a focus on developing the apprentice group, sharing and disseminating practice together, collaboration and teamwork in learning, planning and teaching. You will undertake audits of your skills, experience and scientific knowledge in relation to the curriculum requirements and the Teachers’ Standards. These will be used to build a personalised learning plan that you will update and maintain throughout your programme.\r\nThe weekly sessions focusses on:\r\n•\tPedagogy and progression\r\n•\tCurriculum, assessment and progression\r\n•\tSubject development\r\n•\tPersonal development, behaviour, and welfare, including anti-bullying and Social, Emotional and Mental Health (SEMH)\r\n•\tBehaviour for learning\r\n•\tLiteracy and numeracy across the curriculum\r\n•\tSafeguarding, including the Prevent, Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) duty\r\n•\tSpecial educational needs and disabilities\r\n•\tCharacter development, including Spiritual, Moral, Social and Cultural (SMSC), PSHE and British Values\r\n•\tReflection and self-development\r\n","interviewProcess":"Ripley SCITT is looking for people who have the determination to succeed, a commitment to working hard and the ability to work with others. You will be able to show enthusiasm for your subject/ phase and demonstrate a strong desire to work with children and make a difference in their lives. You will be willing to listen to advice and act on feedback in order to continually improve and develop as a teacher.\r\n\r\nThe assessment day is a half-day and will be based in your employing school. You will complete a number of tasks during the day which may include:\r\n•\tA formal interview\r\n•\tA group presentation task and discussion\r\n•\tA written task\r\n•\tA short teaching activity\r\n•\tAn unseen task\r\n\r\nThe interview panel will consider your:\r\n•\tQuality of subject knowledge\r\n•\tAbility to communicate effectively and explain difficult concepts\r\n•\tCapacity to establish effective relationships inside and outside the classroom\r\n•\tPassion and drive to deliver the highest quality of educational standards\r\n•\tCommitment to develop as an educator of character\r\n•\tSuitability to train to teach and to meet the Teachers’ Standards by the end of training\r\n•\tFlexibility to adapt to change and ability to think instantaneously\r\n•\tResilience and your ability to commit to tasks\r\n•\tTime management and organisation.\r\n\r\nThe interview panel will usually consist of a representative from one of our Partnership schools and Ripley SCITT.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Our secondary apprenticeship is structured to offer training across the 11-16 age range. In recognition of the fact that certain teaching approaches must be secured before a teacher can bring about good or better pupil progress as a result of the lessons they deliver, we adopt a graduated approach to ensure the systematic development of our apprentices.\r\n\r\nIn Term 1 you will begin to develop the foundations of teaching practice, relating educational theory to classroom practice within your employing school. As your skills develop, you will take on increasing responsibility for the classroom planning, teaching and assessment.\r\n\r\nIn Term 2 you will build upon the basics from your first term and start to develop a deeper understanding of effective pedagogical practice as well as have a 6 week contrasting school experience within a different setting.\r\nDuring the final phase in Term 3 you will master an extended repertoire of teaching practices within your employing school to ensure outstanding learning and progress.\r\n\r\nYou will undertake a short placement in a primary setting and a second placement in KS5. This experience will complement the sessions centred on transition and ensure you fully understand the expectations, curricula, strategies and teaching arrangements in the age group immediately before and after those you are trained to teach.\r\n\r\nYou will gain experience in a Special School to focus on Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND). This will build on learning already undertaken during the centre-based course and develop a keen appreciation of the needs of diverse children and how to support their learning.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2022-01-12T12:02:47.733Z","updatedAt":"2022-01-12T12:03:37.925Z","canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","cycle":"2024"}
