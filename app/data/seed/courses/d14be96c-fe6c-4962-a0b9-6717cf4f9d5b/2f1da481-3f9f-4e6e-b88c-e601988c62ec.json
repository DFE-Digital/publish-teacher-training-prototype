The Friday conferences will be hosted and delivered by outstanding classroom practitioners who currently teach in our partner schools. Curriculum conferences will be held in several of our school venues according to the best expertise available for each topic.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there will be subject pedagogy days during the year where trainees will focus on teaching science specifically. These will be delivered by the Science Learning Centre at Ashton Community Science College. Biology, Chemistry and Physics trainees study together on these days and this is really useful because you will find that in most schools you will teach combined science at KS3. Learning together really helps you develop your subject knowledge across the three sciences and we can also organise additional courses for you via the Science Learning Centre to meet your individual needs.\r\n\r\nYou will audit your subject knowledge for the topics you will need to teach at KS3 and 4. Lead Subject Mentors will guide you towards great resources for this and you will be encouraged to join a professional subject association. A shared drive enables you to share resources with each other and school mentors. \r\n\r\nLeeds Beckett University provide the PGCE for our SCITT and this is all online. The modules perfectly compliment the training we deliver and you will gain 60 Master's level credits (https://courses.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/PGCE_distancelearning/)\r\n\r\nOur programme documentation has been described by Ofsted: \"Documentation is very well designed and contributes significantly to trainees' success on the course\" \r\n\r\nAssessment of trainees for QTS is based on all of the following:\r\n- Regular observations of lessons with feedback and target setting\r\n- Progress towards meeting the Teacher Standards at Key Assessment Points\r\n- Assessment of a Best Evidence Portfolio at the end of the programme.\r\n\r\nWe have been highly praised by Ofsted for our approach to trainee workload, keeping our requirements concise yet effective.","interviewProcess":"Due to coronavirus we are currently conducting interviews via Zoom. You will be asked to submit a lesson plan beforehand and we will ask you about your ideas in the interview. TThere will also be a subject task and a written task which are normally completed at a named venue.\r\n\r\nWe are looking for the potential to be an excellent trainee, someone who is ready to start training in a school setting from early September. We are also looking for potential employees in our schools.\r\n\r\nThe admissions team are Safer Recruitment trained and we are committed to safeguarding children\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will complete placements in two partner schools. The first placement will begin in September, an excellent time to see how rules and routines are established at the start of the academic year. You will start with focused lesson observations across the whole school before you join your subject department and begin to plan teach parts of lessons. After a few weeks you will be planning and delivering whole lessons, building up to approximately 7 hours per week by Christmas. \r\n\r\nThe second placement begins after Christmas in a different school which will give you a contrasting experience and broaden your professional development. Again, you will gradually increase your teaching timetable and for the last few weeks will be full time in school, teaching up to 12 hours per week at that point in May and June.\r\n\r\nPlacements are selected for you on the basis of high quality mentoring, strong subject departments, contrasting schools and reasonable commuting distance. We work with around 15 schools in Lancashire. \r\n\r\nOn both placements you will teach the 11-16 age range in your subject. \r\nThere may also be opportunities to spend some time in other partner schools and settings as training needs arise. There will normally be additional opportunities to experience primary education and sixth form education on the programme. \r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for people who are keen to learn in a school setting and this model suits trainees who are able to learn as they go along and incorporate their own experience into this learning process. Successful applicants will have an understanding of the professionalism and resilience needed to become a teacher and to be reflective learners. A real commitment to a career in teaching, a love of their subject and positive attitude towards young people are essential qualities.\r\n","otherRequirements":"Applicants who are successful at interview will need the following before they can start the programme:\r\n-\tDBS and barred list check\r\n-\tMedical check\r\n-\tProfessional skills tests literacy and numeracy\r\n\r\nIt is important that you have a good awareness of what the role of a teacher involves so that you can be sure it is the right career choice for you. We offer school experience for people at all stages of this career decision, including after interview, in order to support you with this.\r\n\r\nWe welcome applicants of all ages, from university graduation to mature career changers.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:47:28.514Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-23T11:03:42.268Z","cycle":"2023","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"}
