Curriculum conferences will be held in several of our school venues according to the best expertise available for each topic.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there will be subject pedagogy days during the year where trainees will focus on teaching English specifically. These will be delivered by a Lead Subject Mentor for English, a Specialist Leader of Education who has been appointed due to their successful track record in subject leadership. The days incorporate learning walks and lesson experience alongside input from the Lead Subject Mentor and directed tasks for you to consolidate your learning.\r\n\r\nYou will audit your subject knowledge for the topics you will need to teach at KS3 and 4. Lead Subject Mentors will guide you towards great resources for this and you will be encouraged to join a professional subject association. A shared drive enables you to share resources with each other and school mentors. \r\n\r\nLeeds Beckett University provide the PGCE for our SCITT and this is all online. The modules perfectly compliment the training we deliver and you will gain 60 Master's level credits (https://courses.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/PGCE_distancelearning/)\r\n\r\nOur programme documentation has been described by Ofsted: \"Documentation is very well designed and contributes significantly to trainees' success on the course\" \r\n\r\nAssessment of trainees for QTS is based on all of the following:\r\n-\tRegular observations of lessons with feedback and target setting\r\n-\tGrading against each of the Teacher Standards at the end of each placement\r\n-\tFormative feedback about progress against the Teacher Standards throughout the placements\r\n-\tAssessment of a Best Evidence Portfolio at the end of the programme.\r\n\r\nWe have been highly praised by Ofsted for our approach to trainee workload, keeping our requirements concise yet effective.","interviewProcess":"Due to coronavirus we are currently conducting interviews via Zoom. You will be asked to submit a lesson plan beforehand and we will ask you about your ideas in the interview. There will also be a subject task and a written task which are completed under time limits via email.\r\n\r\nWe are looking for the potential to be an excellent trainee, someone who is ready to start training in a school setting from early September. We are also looking for potential employees in our schools.\r\n\r\nThe admissions team are Safer Recruitment trained and we are committed to safeguarding children","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will complete placements in two partner schools. The first placement will be 2 days per week for the whole of year 1, beginning in early September, which is an excellent time to see how rules and routines are established at the start of the academic year. You will start with focused lesson observations across the whole school before you join your subject department and begin to plan and teach parts of lessons. After a few weeks you will be planning and delivering whole lessons, building up to approximately 6 hours per week by the last term. \r\n\r\nThe second placement will be 2 days per week for the whole of year 2 in a different school which will give you a contrasting experience and broaden your professional development. Again, you will gradually increase your teaching timetable and for the last few weeks will be full time in school, teaching up to 12 hours per week at that point in May and June.\r\n\r\nPlacements are selected for you on the basis of high quality mentoring, strong subject departments, contrasting schools and reasonable commuting distance. We work with several schools in Lancashire. \r\n\r\nOn both placements you will teach the full 11-16 age range in your subject. \r\nThere may also be opportunities to spend some time in other partner schools and settings as training needs arise. There will be additional opportunities to experience primary education and sixth form education on the programme. ","personalQualities":"We are looking for people who are keen to learn in a school setting and this model suits trainees who are able to learn as they go along and incorporate their own experience into this learning process. Successful applicants will have an understanding of the professionalism and resilience needed to become a teacher and to be reflective learners. A real commitment to a career in teaching, a love of their subject and positive attitude towards young people are essential qualities.\r\n","otherRequirements":"Applicants who are successful at interview will need the following before they can start the programme:\r\n-\tDBS and barred list check\r\n-\tMedical check\r\n\r\nIt is important that you have a good awareness of what the role of a teacher involves so that you can be sure it is the right career choice for you.
