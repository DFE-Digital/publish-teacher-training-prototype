These training days will be hosted and delivered by outstanding classroom practitioners who currently teach in our partner schools and they will be held in several of our school venues according to the best expertise available for each topic.\r\n\r\nYou will have training and experience in important primary education topics, including phonics and early reading, assessment, special needs and inclusion, working with support staff and parents and leadership. There are many different subjects taught in primary education and you will audit your subject knowledge for the topics you will need to teach at KS1 and 2. Some of the training days will focus specifically on these subjects, but on this course there will be a much greater emphasis on teaching Mathematics. A shared drive enables you to share resources with each other and school mentors. \r\n\r\nLeeds Beckett University provide the PGCE for our SCITT and this is all online. The modules perfectly compliment the training we deliver and you will gain 60 Master's level credits (https://courses.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/PGCE_distancelearning/)\r\n\r\nOur programme documentation has been described by Ofsted: \"Documentation is very well designed and contributes significantly to trainees' success on the course\" \r\n\r\nAssessment of trainees for QTS is based on all of the following:\r\n-\tRegular observations of lessons with feedback and target setting\r\n-\tGrading against each of the Teacher Standards at the end of each placement\r\n-\tFormative feedback about progress against the Teacher Standards throughout the placements\r\n-\tAssessment of a Best Evidence Portfolio at the end of the programme.\r\n\r\nWe have been highly praised by Ofsted for our approach to trainee workload, keeping our requirements concise yet effective.","interviewProcess":"Due to coronavirus we are currently conducting interviews via Zoom.

There will also be a subject task and a written task which are completed under time limits via email.\r\n\r\nWe are looking for the potential to be an excellent trainee, someone who is ready to start training in a school setting from early September.

The first placement will begin early in September, an excellent time to see how rules and routines are established at the start of the academic year. You will start with focused lesson observations before you begin to plan and teach parts of lessons. After a few weeks you will be planning and delivering whole lessons, building up to approximately 7 hours per week by Christmas. \r\n\r\nThe second and third placements will be in different schools which will give you a contrasting experience and broaden your professional development. Again, you will gradually increase your teaching timetable and for the last few weeks will be full time in school, teaching up to 12 hours per week at that point in May and June. \r\n\r\nPlacements are selected for you on the basis of high quality mentoring, your individual training needs, the opportunity to experience the full primary age range, contrasting schools and reasonable commuting distance. We have several partner primary schools in Lancashire.\r\n\r\nOn both placements you will teach the full 5-11 age range in your subject. \r\nThere may also be opportunities to spend some time in other partner schools and settings as training needs arise. There will be additional opportunities to experience reception and secondary education on the programme. ","personalQualities":"We are looking for people who are keen to learn in a school setting and this model suits trainees who are able to learn as they go along and incorporate their own experience into this learning process.
