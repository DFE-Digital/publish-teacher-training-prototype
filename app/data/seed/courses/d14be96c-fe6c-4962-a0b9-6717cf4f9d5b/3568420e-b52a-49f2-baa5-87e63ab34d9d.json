There are many different subjects taught in primary education and you will audit your subject knowledge for the topics you will need to teach at KS1 and 2. Some of the training days will focus specifically on these subjects. A shared drive enables you to share resources with each other and school mentors. \r\n\r\nLeeds Beckett University provide the PGCE for our SCITT and this is all online. The modules perfectly compliment the training we deliver and you will gain 60 Master's level credits (https://courses.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/PGCE_distancelearning/)\r\n\r\nOur programme documentation has been described by Ofsted: \"Documentation is very well designed and contributes significantly to trainees' success on the course\" \r\n\r\nAssessment of trainees for QTS is based on all of the following:\r\n-\tRegular observations of lessons with feedback and target setting\r\n-\tProgress towards meeting the Teacher Standards at Key Assessment Points\r\n-\tAssessment of a Best Evidence Portfolio at the end of the programme.\r\n\r\nWe have been highly praised by Ofsted for our approach to trainee workload, keeping our requirements concise yet effective.","interviewProcess":"Due to coronavirus we are currently conducting interviews via Zoom. You will be asked to submit a lesson plan beforehand and we will ask you about your ideas in the interview. There will also be a subject task and a written task which are normally completed at a named venue.\r\n\r\nWe are looking for the potential to be an excellent trainee, someone who is ready to start training in a school setting from early September. We are also looking for potential employees in our schools.\r\n\r\nThe admissions team are Safer Recruitment trained and we are committed to safeguarding children","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will complete placements in three partner schools. The first placement will be in year 1, beginning in September which is an excellent time to see how rules and routines are established at the start of the academic year. You will start with focused lesson observations before you begin to plan and teach parts of lessons. After a few weeks you will be planning and delivering whole lessons, building up to approximately 7 hours per week by the end of the year. \r\n\r\nThe second placement in year 2 will be in a different school, which will give you a contrasting experience and broaden your professional development. Again, you will gradually increase your teaching timetable throughout the year. \r\n\r\nPlacements are selected for you on the basis of high quality mentoring, your individual training needs, the opportunity to experience the full primary age range, contrasting schools and reasonable commuting distance. We have several partner primary schools in Lancashire.\r\n\r\nOn both placements you will teach the 5-11 age range in your subject. \r\nThere may also be opportunities to spend some time in other partner schools and settings as training needs arise. There will be additional opportunities to experience reception and secondary education on the programme. ","personalQualities":"We are looking for people who are keen to learn in a school setting and this model suits trainees who are able to learn as they go along and incorporate their own experience into this learning process. Successful applicants will have an understanding of the professionalism and resilience needed to become a teacher and to be reflective learners.
