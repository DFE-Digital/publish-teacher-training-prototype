Inclusion and anti-racism are key features and strengths of our programmes and we are committed to training teachers who will value and build on the linguistic, religious, ethnic and cultural diversity that children in East London communities bring to school and who in turn, will prepare all children for life in a diverse society. \r\n\r\n* Trainees are mainly based in one school, where they will develop a close working relationship with the staff, pupils and parents. \r\n\r\n* We have a balance of centre-based training in theory and practice with extended school placements where trainees can put this learning into practice.\r\n\r\n* Focus on preparing trainees for teaching children with diverse needs (for example pupils with English as an Additional Language or SEN; higher attaining pupils, vulnerable or Looked After Children). \r\n\r\n* We have high expectations of our trainees - both academically and in their classroom practice. \r\n\r\n* We have a great commitment to equal opportunities, including raising attainment for all and closing the gap. \r\n\r\n* A particular focus on teaching reading (including systematic synthetic phonics); early maths; assessment and P.E.\r\n\r\nAssessment:\r\n\r\nAt the start of the programme, all trainees will meet with their designated professional tutor - from SCITTELS - to devise a bespoke action plan based on their individual needs. Subsequently, trainees will be assessed weekly by their School Based Mentor against their targets. Training activities will enable trainees to gather evidence towards their targets throughout the year. \r\n\r\nThe School Direct PGCE programme leads to Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and the academic award of a Post Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE), comprising of 60 M Level credits. The programme is currently validated by Goldsmiths University. \r\n\r\nTrainees on the programme complete two assignments which are assessed at level 7.
