Two practices will take place at the lead school and one other at a contrasting school.  This is to improve the employability of students leaving the course.  \r\n\r\nBespoke opportunities are arranged to meet individual needs or interests of our students in the cohort.\r\n","personalQualities":"We look for enthusiastic learners who thrive in a busy and exciting environment.
