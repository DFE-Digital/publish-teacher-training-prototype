Sir Robert Geffery's is an outstanding school that has had a high level of success in teacher training.  Bridging the Tamar SLEs provide additional training throughout the year. \r\n\r\nThis course often suits people who are looking for a teaching qualification without the additional study for the PGCE.  Ideal for those with families or less time for additional study.\r\n\r\nStudents will have the opportunity to also develop subject specialisms in the primary curriculum by working alongside our specialist delivery team.\r\n\r\nAs Bridging the Tamar is a small Teaching School, we pride ourselves in the ability to bespoke the training to meet the needs of our successful candidates.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Interviews are arranged throughout the year when we invite candidates to spend a day at the school meeting the staff and pupils.  During the day a lesson will be taught and a presentation made to the School Council.  Representatives from the Governing Body and Marjons usually attend the formal interview process.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Depending upon where students live, the placements are allocated.  If possible we ensure one placement is always at Sir Robert Geffery's or our partner school, Ermington in Devon.\r\n\r\nDuring the training, students work across the whole primary age range.  Two practices will take place at the lead school and one other at a contrasting school.  This is to improve the employability of students leaving the course.  \r\n\r\nBespoke opportunities are arranged to meet individual needs or interests of our students in the cohort.\r\n","personalQualities":"We look for enthusiastic learners who thrive in a busy and exciting environment.
