The PGCE includes 60 credits at Masters level, the equivalent of one third of an MA that you can add to subsequently. Or you can decide to go for QTS only.\r\n\r\nThe programme is the result of long-standing close collaboration between the University of Reading and local Partnership Schools. Through this Partnership, we are able to make strong and effective links between the theoretical perspective, drawing on current and recent research, and the practical skills of teaching. The programme is designed to support you in developing the knowledge, understanding and skills that schools look for when appointing Newly Qualified Teachers (NQTs), as well as providing you with the skills and aptitude to develop your teaching career.\r\n\r\nAt University, time is spent studying both the theory and the practice of whole school issues. Lectures and seminars are led by University tutors, with contributions from expert teachers from local Partnership schools.\r\nIn schools, you will work alongside mentor teachers, further supported by University tutors. The placements are planned to support you to develop their knowledge and understanding by taking increasing responsibility for groups and whole classes\r\n\r\nYour training is a gradual, staged process. You will be given opportunities to observe good practice and work with groups before taking some full class responsibility. During the final school experience you will assume the teacher's role for the majority of the placement; however a trainee does not have sole responsibility for classes at any stage during their training\r\n\r\nAssessment is on-going through the programme. On the PGCE route academic work is assessed through assignments which can take the form of essays. Formative and summative assessment of practical teaching skills is on-going during the School Experiences\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"If your application is shortlisted, you will be invited for an interview and assessment day at the school where the placement is.\r\n\r\nIf you are successful at interview, a conditional offer of a place will be made. The conditions will include providing proof that you have met the eligibility conditions for Initial Teacher Training, including a criminal record check and an occupational health assessment. Further conditions may be discussed with you at interview.\r\n\r\nIf you accept the offer of a place, you will be required to attend an Induction and Needs Assessment Afternoon at the University of Reading. This will be an opportunity to meet the University tutor, who will help you identify pre-course targets to prepare you for your training. \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"This placement is at Potley Hill Primary School.
