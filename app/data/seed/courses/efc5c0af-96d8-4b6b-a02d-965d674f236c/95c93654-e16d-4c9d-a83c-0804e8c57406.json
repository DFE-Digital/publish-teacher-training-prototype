You will have opportunities to consider issues raised in school against a wide range of educational principles to which you will be introduced.\r\n\r\nPeriods of school experience are integrated into all aspects of the course, and you work in schools throughout the year. Your work in school takes a variety of forms including observing experienced teachers, team teaching, working with small groups, taking responsibility for the learning of whole classes and getting involved in all aspects of school life. You will be well supported in school by a range of experienced and well-trained people including a subject and a professional mentor and university-based tutors.\r\n\r\nThe university-based programme comprises two main aspects: Professional Studies and Subject Studies.\r\n\r\nProfessional Studies develops insights into general aspects of education essential for entrants to the teaching profession. It gives consideration to whole-school issues, such as behaviour management, special educational needs and educational theories that contextualise the teaching of your subject. It is taught in small, mixed-subject seminar groups.\r\n\r\nSubject Studies enables you to study the teaching of your chosen subject. This includes consideration of aspects such as: the nature of the subject in the secondary school; its place in The National Curriculum; what is taught; how it is taught; how it is assessed; providing for young people with different backgrounds and abilities; teaching in accordance with examination specification requirements; and using ICT effectively to facilitate learning.\r\n","interviewProcess":"If your application is shortlisted, you will be invited for an interview and assessment day at Calthorpe Park School or at one of our consortium partner schools.\r\n\r\nIf you are successful at interview, a conditional offer of a place will be made. The conditions will include providing proof that you have met the eligibility conditions for Initial Teacher Training, including a criminal record check and an occupational health assessment. Further conditions may be discussed with you at interview.\r\n\r\nIf you accept the offer of a place, you will be required to attend an Induction and Needs Assessment Afternoon at the University of Reading. This will be an opportunity to meet the University subject tutor, who will help you identify pre-course targets to prepare you for your training.
