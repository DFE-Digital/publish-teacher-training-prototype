The PGCE includes 60 credits at Masters level, the equivalent of one third of an MA that you can add to subsequently.\r\n\r\nThe course content has been developed in collaboration between the University and partnership schools so that you can explore issues raised in the University through your work with pupils in school. You will have opportunities to consider issues raised in school against a wide range of educational principles to which you will be introduced.\r\n\r\nPeriods of school experience are integrated into all aspects of the course, and you work in schools throughout the year. Your work in school takes a variety of forms including observing experienced teachers, team teaching, working with small groups, taking responsibility for the learning of whole classes and getting involved in all aspects of school life. You will be well supported in school by a range of experienced and well-trained people including a subject and a professional mentor and university-based tutors.\r\n\r\nThe university-based programme comprises two main aspects: Professional Studies and Subject Studies.\r\n\r\nProfessional Studies develops insights into general aspects of education essential for entrants to the teaching profession. It gives consideration to whole-school issues, such as behaviour management, special educational needs and educational theories that contextualise the teaching of your subject. It is taught in small, mixed-subject seminar groups.\r\n\r\nSubject Studies enables you to study the teaching of your chosen subject. This includes consideration of aspects such as: the nature of the subject in the secondary school; its place in The National Curriculum; what is taught; how it is taught; how it is assessed; providing for young people with different backgrounds and abilities; teaching in accordance with examination specification requirements; and using ICT effectively to facilitate learning.\r\n","interviewProcess":"If your application is shortlisted, you will be invited for an interview and assessment day at Calthorpe Park School or at one of our consortium partner schools.\r\n\r\nIf you are successful at interview, a conditional offer of a place will be made. The conditions will include providing proof that you have met the eligibility conditions for Initial Teacher Training, including a criminal record check and an occupational health assessment. Further conditions may be discussed with you at interview.\r\n\r\nIf you accept the offer of a place, you will be required to attend an Induction and Needs Assessment Afternoon at the University of Reading. This will be an opportunity to meet the University subject tutor, who will help you identify pre-course targets to prepare you for your training. If you are offered a salaried place, you will be asked to attend an induction day at school, on which you will agree an Individual Training Plan and the details of your contract with the school.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"This placement is at Frogmore Community College.\r\nFrogmore Community College is a mixed 11-16 comprehensive school located in Yateley, NE Hampshire. The number on role is now 680 and it has a specialism in technology. The school is committed to not only the personal and social development of our students but also to enabling them to achieve the highest possible academic standards.\r\n\r\nThe school has a stable core staffing structure and is fully staffed with specialist teachers and specialist rooms in all areas. Frogmore's catchment is very small but a high proportion (44%) of students come from outside of this catchment and the school works in close partnership with its cluster partner primary schools on a range of teaching and learning focusses.\r\n\r\nFrogmore serves a generally affluent and predominantly white middle class catchment, but with small pockets of significant deprivation. Due to the proximity of the College to army barracks, there are growing numbers of Nepali students. It is truly a full-range comprehensive school and is a 'Full Access School' for students with physical disabilities.\r\n\r\nFollowing our Ofsted inspection in January 2017 we maintained our good rating for overall effectiveness, achievement of pupils, quality of teaching, behaviour and safety of pupils and leadership and management. \r\n\r\nThe school has an  extensive and well established experience of initial teacher training and is totally committed to giving trainees the experiences necessary to meet the standards set out for teachers by the DFES.\r\n\r\nwww.frogmorecollege.hants.sch.uk\r\n\r\n\r\nYour second placement is after Christmas for 8 weeks at another school – either a school in our consortium or a school of your choice.\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"All candidates must show proficiency in fundamental numeracy and literacy skills.\r\n\r\nAll applicants are expected to have gained some experience in a state secondary school prior to interview.\r\n","otherRequirements":"","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:48:40.989Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-27T11:45:20.881Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2024"}
