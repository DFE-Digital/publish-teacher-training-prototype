In some instances we ask for the subject leader from the University to attend as well in order to quality assure our work.\r\n\r\nWe also ask you to prepare a short presentation on an issue that will be given to you on the day.  In addition, you will be required to complete a written task.\r\n\r\nYou will very much be encouraged to ask us questions about the course and the school to ensure that it is the right school for you!\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"This placement is at Collingwood College\r\n\r\nCollingwood College is Surrey Heath’s first high-performing Academy.  Collingwood is one of Surrey’s largest and most successful secondary schools for students aged 11-19.  We have more than 1700 students, including a Sixth Form of well over 250 students and 150 teaching and support staff, all of whom are dedicated to ensuring that all our students fulfil their potential and enjoy to the full their secondary education.\r\n\r\nAs a comprehensive school specialising in Technology, we welcome students of all abilities. The College offers an outstanding range of educational and extra-curricular opportunities, which few other schools can match.  \r\n\r\nThe College’s very successful OFSTED inspection in January 2017 confirmed it to be a good school with outstanding leadership and management.  Collingwood’s breadth of curriculum and the quality of the Sixth Form received particular praise.  Academic performance at GCSE and A Level is impressive.  Our relentless focus on English and Maths ensures results at GCSE are consistently high.  Able students are stretched with, on average, 20% of the cohort achieving 5 or more Grade 7-9 each year.\r\n\r\nThe diverse talents of our students supported by committed and highly experienced staff are key factors in the success of the College.  All Collingwood students are offered a wide range of personal development and leadership opportunities within their curriculum.  \r\nWe have a thriving Sixth Form based in a purpose-built teaching centre.  The majority of our students progress into our Sixth Form and from there into higher education.  We offer extensive academic and vocational programmes of study.\r\n","personalQualities":"Above all else, we are looking for someone who is passionate about teaching and working with young people.  Whilst subject knowledge is important, for us we are looking for someone who is confident, dynamic and someone who can inspire young people.  A sense of humour is also vital!","otherRequirements":"","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-11-25T10:59:33.822Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-25T11:00:35.827Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2023"}
