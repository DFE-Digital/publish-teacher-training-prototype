After the winter break you will enhance your teaching with three weeks of intensive training and subject development before embarking on placement B at a contrasting school.  You will again be teaching about 11 lessons a week for the six week period.  You are then back to you original placement until mid-June, working on your weekly targets with \"your\" classes.
