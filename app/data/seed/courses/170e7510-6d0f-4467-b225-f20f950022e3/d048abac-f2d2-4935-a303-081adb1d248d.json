Trainees attend lectures and seminars at the University of Bedford, one day a week, with the rest of the time spent in one of our DLPT schools or partnership schools. The training course covers the age range from five to eleven years, and operates either as a full or part time course.  \r\n\r\n*Full time: over one school academic year. \r\n\r\n*Part time: over two school academic years.\r\n\r\nYou will have a base school where you will carry out the majority of your placement. A contrasting placement in a second setting is undertaken during the Spring term. This will provide a broader view of educational issues and experiences. On the part time course, you spend the whole academic year in one school and then transfer to a contrasting school in the second year.\r\n\r\nYou will be assigned a school-based mentor. They will meet with you on a weekly basis to provide guidance and support. Starting on a zero % teaching timetable, with the support of your mentor this will gradually increase over the academic year until you are eventually teaching around 80% of a full timetable independently. Teaching time on the part time course increases in a similar way over the two year period.\r\n\r\nUpon successful completion of the course, all trainees will have achieved Qualified Teacher Status (QTS), a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) and credits towards a Masters degree.\r\n","interviewProcess":"How we select our trainees.\r\n\r\nThe Course Coordinator will check all applications to see if the applicants meet the entry criteria.

Successful candidates will be informed of the outcome within seven days of the interview date.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"All of our placement schools are part of the Diamond Learning Partnership Trust. The schools are in the St Neots, Fenland and Royston areas.

The base school is where trainees undertake their placement in the Autumn and Summer Terms, they will then be placed in a contrasting school during the Spring Term. This ensures trainees are provided with a broad view and experience of primary education and have the opportunity to teach in both Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2. \r\n\r\nTrainees spend four days a week in school so they can be immersed into school life right from the start. They become a member of the teaching team, taking part in all staff meetings and whole school staff development, with the opportunity to also get involved in after school extra-curricular activities and school events.\r\n\r\nPart time trainees also have two contrasting placements,namely one placement per school academic year. They spend two days a week in school. \r\n\r\nAll trainees have a mentor who is based in their placement school - this is usually the class teacher.
