The course equips you to teach primary-aged pupils and covers all areas of the Key Stage 1 and 2 curriculum through lectures, seminars, workshops and tutorials. \r\n\r\nYou'll spend a minimum of 120 days (24 weeks) training in school. We'll organise these placements, ensuring that you are placed in at least two contrasting schools. \r\n\r\nYou'll study two modules at Master's level  and on completion of the course we'll award you with a Postgraduate Certificate in Education.  The Master's level assignments are broken up into manageable chunks, with clear links to your school-based training and submission dates set after self-study breaks.  For the Master's level options module, you'll choose a particular area in which to develop expertise: these options include Early Years with placements in early years and  key stage 1.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of the university content is delivered at our Elephant and Castle campus. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"If we think your application shows that you have the potential to be a great teacher, we'll invite you to interview, even if you haven't yet met all of the required entry criteria.  On the interview day, we'll find out about your subject knowledge and you'll be asked to deliver a short lesson to a group of fellow applicants.  You'll complete a short writing task and you'll also be interviewed by a member of the PGCE teaching team.  You'll have plenty of opportunities to ask questions and we'll take you on a tour of our campus.\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We have strong and long standing partnerships with 90 schools across London.

The first placement focuses on developing your skills in supporting individual pupils and small groups of pupils in early reading and early mathematics.  The alternative educational setting placement is an opportunity to work with learners in a setting other than a mainstream primary school.  You'll complete two further substantial placements during which you'll take on the full role of the class teacher. \r\nWhile on placement you'll get support and guidance from a supervising tutor from the university and from the class teacher in whose class you're placed.","personalQualities":"We're looking for applicants with genuine enthusiasm for working with young learners and a commitment to the principles of social justice.\r\n\r\nYour reference will be positive and will highlight your suitability to train to be a teacher.  \r\n\r\nYour personal written statement should be coherent, written in clear standard English, and include evidence of:\r\n*your commitment to value and respect diversity;\r\n*your experience of or commitment to working with young or adult learners in a formal and/or informal setting;\r\n*your awareness of current issues in education.","otherRequirements":"For information about all LSBU's statutory requirements linked to Teacher Training programmes please visit our [website](http://www.lsbu.ac.uk/courses/course-finder/primary-pgce#course_tab_entry_requirements).
