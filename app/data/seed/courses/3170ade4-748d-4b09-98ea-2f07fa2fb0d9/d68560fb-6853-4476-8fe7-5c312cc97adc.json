There may also be a tour of the school and for Secondary applicants a discussion relating to your chosen subject.\r\n\r\nAbove is the description of the usual selection process. However due to COVID-19 this is subject to change and some aspects may be conducted remotely.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"To gain additional experience you will attend a contrasting school for your placement.
