","aboutCourse":"From the moment you start the course and walk into a classroom we will be equipping you with the knowledge you need to help your students to flourish and fulfil their potential.  \r\n\r\nThis is a teacher training course covering teaching in the 7-14 age range meaning that your learning will be based in both primary and secondary schools. To qualify for a bursary payment you will need to meet the eligibility criteria which includes spending over half of your school placement time in a secondary school. \r\n\r\nThis course will equip you with the knowledge of what the most recent and rigorous research tells us about effective teaching. You will begin to understand and be equipped to use in the classroom teaching methods that are practical, effective and informed by the best evidence based research. This will include:\r\n\r\n* how teachers structure explanations effectively so that students understand,  \r\n* how effective teachers question students and offer feedback and \r\n* how the best teachers get students to practice until they have mastered a topic.\r\n\r\nWe believe in the importance of a 'knowledge rich' curriculum in which students are taught the key content they need to have in order to succeed.  You will therefore be tutored and mentored by a subject specialist who knows the most effective ways of:\r\n\r\n* how to plan specific content, \r\n* how to avoid the misconceptions students may have\r\n* ensuring students make strong progress. \r\n\r\nThis means that we will be able to equip you with a deep knowledge of your subject area and how best to teach it.\r\n\r\nWe also consider it important that every trainee teacher understands what cognitive science tells us about how learning takes place in the human mind. We therefore place great emphasis on cognitive load theory and how it can be used to help students retain knowledge in their long term memory. This allows you as a teacher to help your students to learn more and succeed further at school and beyond. \r\n\r\nThe course should provide you with the strongest of foundations so that you have the best possible start to your teaching career. Our trainees have a very high success rate in securing teaching jobs on completion of their training with a large number of them passing with the 'outstanding' grade. \r\n","interviewProcess":"As part of our selection process we provide you with:\r\n\r\n* An opportunity to meet one of our admin or leadership team to discuss expectations and practicalities of our course.\r\n\r\n*  A tour of the school.\r\n\r\nYou will need to:\r\n\r\n* Give a short presentation about how you have helped someone or a small group learn something \r\n\r\n* Choose a text and read it to the interview panel. \r\n\r\n* Prepare for a formal interview in which you will be asked about why you wish to teach and how you can show you have the capacity, personal characteristics and qualifications to do so. You will also have a more informal interview with a subject specialist (normally a head of department) who will discuss with you your subject specific qualifications and identify any particular areas of subject knowledge that may need further development before the course begins. \r\n\r\n* Complete a written task for which no preparation is required.\r\n\r\n* Complete our safe recruitment checklist and provide appropriate certificates (e.g. your degree certificate).\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"During your training year we ensure that you teach across the full age range from 7-14. You will therefore be trained to teach years KS2 and KS3. We consider that this will give you the strongest start to your teaching career.\r\n\r\nYou will spend most of your training year in two schools; one primary and one secondary. During our first four terms (until Easter) you will alternate an approximate 5/3 week rotation in these schools. For example, in term 1 you will spend five weeks in a secondary school and then three weeks in a primary. In term 2 you will have three weeks in a secondary and 5 weeks in a primary. Then from term 5 onwards you will specialise in either a primary or secondary school. \r\n\r\nBy being part of these school communities you will become an integral part of them.  You will therefore be able to build a strong relationship with your mentor and other colleagues in the schools as well as the students. As your mentor comes to know you they will be able to more effectively support you throughout the course. \r\n\r\nIn placing a trainee in a school we consider the individual strengths of each trainee and how they can best match the profiles of the schools, mentor and subject heads of department we work with. We also consider the distance a trainee would have to travel and any preference they express at interview about where they would like to train to teach.  ","personalQualities":"We are looking for candidates who are willing to work hard to help ensure that children get the best possible education. Candidates need to believe that they can, as teachers, make a difference and help children flourish. They will need to be ambitious for the children they teach and be able to show tenacity at times of challenge. They should be able to demonstrate a strong subject knowledge and be open to learning and reflecting upon how they can develop as a teacher.","otherRequirements":"Candidates will need to be suitable to work with children and young people. They will be asked questions regarding safeguarding at interview.\r\n\r\nOffers to train to teach with us are made on condition of:\r\n\r\n•\tSatisfactory Enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) or Disclosure Scotland or overseas equivalent.  \r\n•\tSatisfactory clearance of Prohibited teachers check.\r\n•\tSatisfactory clearance of Children’s Barred checklist.\r\n•\tSatisfactory pre-employment health clearance.\r\n•\tSuccessful completion of Teach Kent & Sussex literacy and numeracy skills assessment. \r\n•\tIdentify check and verification of entitlement to work in the UK; \r\n•\tReceipt of 2 satisfactory professional references.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:51:41.274Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-04T22:43:36.459Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"}
