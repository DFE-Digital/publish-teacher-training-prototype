Trainees will achieve QTS and be enrolled on a PGCE Programme with the Anglia Ruskin University. \r\n\r\nTraining is majority school-based with some centre-based training. Training is a blend of face to face and online and occurs at various locations across Essex so we take into account your home address to try to keep travelling time to a minimum.  You will receive training on the general aspects of successful teaching and training specifically aimed at preparing you to teach maths in primary.  \r\n\r\nOur programmes offer you:\r\n* A high percentage of time spent in a school experienced in training trainees\r\n* A high quality professional studies programme\r\n* Personalised support\r\n* Recognition of your previous experience\r\n* A good understanding of, and preparation for, the teaching profession\r\n\r\nOur training gives you:\r\n* Termly visits from your personal external tutor/subject tutor\r\n* Induction before you start\r\n* A professional studies programme which includes training on National Curriculum subjects, behaviour management, inclusion, assessment and SEND (Please note trainees on the Schools Direct routes will undertake some of this training with their host schools)\r\n* Opportunities to meet regularly with other trainees\r\n* Opportunities to observe and work alongside experienced teachers, gradually taking more responsibility for group and class teaching\r\n* Teaching experience across a specified age range: 3-7 or 5-11 years\r\n* Teaching experience in at least two schools\r\n* A comprehensive course handbook outlining all course requirements (online resource)\r\n\r\nAssessment is via observations of you teaching, reflective pieces of writing and specific tasks relating to the different Teachers' Standards.  You will be required to teach a greater amount of maths but you will be assessed as any other Primary trainee, across all aspects of the curriculum.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to train on the part-time School direct programme, this is typically for 3 days a week over the course of 2 years.  The programme is very similar to the one year programme in terms of support and delivery, the only difference being that you will be in school 2 days per week and attend training on 1 day a week.  The majority of centre-based training will take place in Year 1 and you will be enrolled on the PGCE programme in Year 2.\r\n","interviewProcess":"You will be invited to an interview in the lead school or one of our partner schools. This interview could include: an activity with pupils, for example, teaching part of a lesson, or taking a group activity; a pupil panel interview; a written task and a formal interview with a small panel of representatives from the school and wider School Direct partnership. If successful, you will be given a conditional offer of a place to train.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Trainees will complete training in two different schools during the course of the year. Typically, trainees spend the autumn term in their host school and then go to a second placement school during the first part of the spring term and then return to their host school for the remainder of the year. Trainees are in school 4 days a week and attend training on the 5th day if on the full time programme and 2 days a week and attend training on the 3rd day if part-time.\r\n\r\nWe endeavour to keep travelling time to a minimum so we will take into account your home address when allocating a school.\r\n\r\nThe programme covers the primary age ranges 3 - 7 or 5 - 11 and you will be teaching within one of these age ranges.\r\n","personalQualities":"MTTP is looking for high quality graduates with a passion for learning who are committed to transforming the lives of you people through education\r\n.
