Some people remember it as their favourite subject, others recall it with horror. This programme is intended for those who are passionate about maths and want to teach it to the 11-16 age range, as something that can be understood and enjoyed. Part of this course extends your studies and experience to cover preparation for post-16 teaching. You’ll spend a third of your course studying at the University with dedicated subject tutors, and the remainder is spent on two teaching practices in two different schools. You’ll benefit from both a professional tutor and a subject-specific, personal mentor to guide you through your teaching practice.\r\n\r\nHull benefits from close partnerships with approximately 90 schools. These schools are largely based in the East Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire region, but we also work with schools as far apart as North and West Yorkshire, as well as schools deep into the Lincolnshire countryside. There’s an opportunity to gain experience across a variety of school and academy types: urban or rural, large or small, comprehensive or selective.\r\n\r\nThis programme will give you the confidence in your own abilities as well as knowledge and understanding of school mathematics. Areas of study include:\r\n\r\nReflecting on the role of a mathematics teacher and the place of mathematics in the school curriculum\r\nDiscussion of the issues, practical work and problem solving\r\nPlanning a variety of classroom approaches\r\nUsing a range of resources, including tablets and mobile phones\r\nSubject Knowledge Enhancement (SKE)\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in teaching mathematics but don’t have a related degree, you can build your knowledge prior to studying the PGCE through a Subject Knowledge Enhancement (SKE) course.\r\n\r\nApplicants should have an A Level or a high-grade GCSE in mathematics, but most importantly, a passion for the subject. \r\n\r\nStudents may be eligible to receive a weekly bursary for the duration of the SKE course. There are no tuition fees. Please contact us for dates of the next course.\r\n\r\nTo apply for an SKE course, you should apply for a place on the Secondary PGCE (Mathematics) and indicate in your application that you would like to do the SKE course.\r\n\r\nTheory\r\nAssessment is based on a range of coursework assignments.\r\n\r\nPractice\r\nThe assessment takes place in schools. You’ll also be assessed on your achievement of the Teachers’ Standards.\r\n\r\nPlease see full information on our webpage (https://www.hull.ac.uk/study/pgce/secondary-pgce-maths.aspx)","interviewProcess":"On receipt of your application, it will be checked for the suitability of the academic qualifications, the quality of both the content and the accuracy of written English and the extent of support provided by the referee. This is always done by the Subject Tutor. Your application will also be seen by a School Mentor, and sometimes by the Programme Director.\r\n\r\nThe Department for Education stipulates that entrants to ITT must possess a first degree of a United Kingdom higher education institution or an equivalent qualification. The University requires that prospective applicants possess or are studying towards a 2:2 honours degree and have appropriate subject knowledge.  The University reserves the right to determine equivalent qualifications.  As we are flexible in our degree subject entry requirements, we suggest you speak to the subject method tutor, Claire Roberts at Claire.Roberts@hull.ac.uk if you are unsure about your suitability.\r\n\r\nYou will be interviewed on an individual basis with a Subject Tutor(s).  Currently, our interviews are being held virtually.\r\n\t\r\nThe interview process is informal and you will be offered the opportunity to ask questions about the programme.  You may be asked to deliver a short presentation on a topic agreed in advance.\r\n\r\nAfter the interview, decisions about the offer of places are made immediately after the interviews and the outcomes communicated to candidates formally through UCAS Teacher Training.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"A total of 120 days are spent in schools during the programme, supported by school mentors, class teachers and University-based tutors.","personalQualities":"We are looking for someone who is:\r\n- Motivated to work with young people and is enthusiastic about their subject\r\n- Adaptable, hardworking and committed to teaching all pupils\r\n- Able to think on their feet, with good communication skills and a sense of humour\r\n- Able to work as a member of a team as well as being independent and resourceful.\r\n- Be well qualified in your subject and to be able to talk about it with understanding and enthusiasm. We would like you to believe that your subject is relevant for pupils of all ages and abilities.","otherRequirements":"Admission is subject to a satisfactory medical report and an Enhanced Clearance by the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS).  If you have spent time living outside of the UK, you may be asked to also provide a satisfactory police check from the country or countries in which you have resided.\r\n\r\nWe run a highly successful Mathematics Subject Knowledge Enhancement (SKE) Course.  This course prepares graduates to train to teach mathematics in a secondary school. Applicants must hold an offer for an ITT place and SKE must be set as a condition of their offer to be considered for our SKE.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:51:28.573Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-23T09:40:07.510Z","cycle":"2023","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
