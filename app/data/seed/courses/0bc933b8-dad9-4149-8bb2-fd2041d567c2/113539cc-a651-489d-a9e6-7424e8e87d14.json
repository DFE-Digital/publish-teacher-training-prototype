The main aim is to help you become a competent and engaging teacher of geography at a secondary level. Part of this course also extends your studies and experience to cover preparation for post-16 teaching. You’ll spend a third of your course studying at the University with dedicated subject tutors, and the remainder is spent on two teaching practices in two different schools. You’ll benefit from both a professional tutor and a subject-specific, personal mentor to guide you through your teaching practice.\r\n\r\nHull benefits from close partnerships with approximately 90 schools. These schools are largely based in the East Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire region, but we also work with schools as far apart as North and West Yorkshire, as well as schools deep into the Lincolnshire countryside. There’s an opportunity to gain experience across a variety of school and academy types: urban or rural, large or small, comprehensive or selective.\r\n\r\nYou’ll focus on a diverse range of core areas. Each session forges a practical link that will enable you to relate geographical theory to its direct impact on children in the classroom. These areas include\r\n\r\nGeography in the National Curriculum and the opportunities that it offers\r\n\r\nDeveloping teaching approaches that will engage pupils of all abilities and backgrounds\r\n\r\nThe changing practices in assessment\r\n\r\nPlanning, preparing, teaching and evaluating quality geography lessons\r\n\r\nThe value and importance of fieldwork\r\n\r\nThe use of new technologies in the production of stimulating and engaging geography lessons\r\n\r\nTheory\r\nAssessment is based on a range of coursework assignments.\r\n\r\nPractice\r\nAssessment takes place in schools. You’ll also be assessed on your achievement of the Teachers’ Standards.\r\n\r\nPlease see full information on our webpage (https://www.hull.ac.uk/study/pgce/secondary-pgce-geography.aspx)","interviewProcess":"On receipt of your application, it will be checked for the suitability of the academic qualifications, the quality of both the content and the accuracy of written English and the extent of support provided by the referee.
