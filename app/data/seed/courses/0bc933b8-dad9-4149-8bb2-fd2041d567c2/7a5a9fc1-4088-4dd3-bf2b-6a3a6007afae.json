There are plenty of opportunities to carry out practical work in our spacious school laboratory.\r\n\r\nIn the first part of the course, the emphasis is on science in the national curriculum. In the later stages, you’ll develop your Key Stage 5 teaching with specialist tutors: learning how to challenge and motivate the range of learners staying on in schools and colleges.\r\n\r\nHull is one of the few universities in the country to provide the option of including your PGCE year as the first year of study for an MA in Educational Studies. You can then complete the MA part-time over the following three years, developing your expertise and career prospects.\r\n\r\nEmployment opportunities are very good since science is a shortage subject nationally and locally. Hull, East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire are popular destinations for our trainees, and you’ll most likely bump into some of our former students on your teaching practices.\r\n\r\nWe work with a range of schools over a wide geographic area, so you'll gain experience in different settings. Staff in the school will support you throughout your placement.\r\n\r\nThe Postgraduate Certificate in Education is an initial qualification in education for those who intend to have a career in teaching. Its three main threads are to \r\n- provide you with the information, knowledge and skills to enable you to embark on a teaching career and become an effective teacher\r\n- help you develop a professional interest in educational issues as the basis for further thought or training\r\n- help your personal development in a critical year that bridges the gap between being a student (or doing some other form of work) and becoming a teacher\r\n\r\nTheory\r\nAssessment is based on a range of coursework assignments.\r\n\r\nPractice\r\nThe assessment takes place in schools. You’ll also be assessed on your achievement of the Teachers’ Standards.\r\n\r\nPlease see full information on our webpage (https://www.hull.ac.uk/study/pgce/secondary-pgce-biology.aspx)","interviewProcess":"On receipt of your application, it will be checked for the suitability of the academic qualifications, the quality of both the content and the accuracy of written English and the extent of support provided by the referee. This is always done by the Subject Tutor. Your application will also be seen by a School Mentor, and sometimes by the Programme Director.\r\n\r\nThe Department for Education stipulates that entrants to ITT must possess a first degree of a United Kingdom higher education institution or an equivalent qualification. The University requires that prospective applicants possess or are studying towards a 2:2 honours degree and have appropriate subject knowledge.  The University reserves the right to determine equivalent qualifications. Since science is such a broad subject area, and we are flexible in our degree subject entry requirements, we suggest you speak to the subject method tutor, Michelle Wormald at m.wormald@hull.ac.uk.\r\n\r\nYou will be interviewed on an individual basis with a Subject Tutor(s).  Currently, our interviews are being held virtually.\r\n\t\r\nThe interview process is informal and you will be offered the opportunity to ask questions about the programme.  You may be asked to deliver a short presentation on a topic agreed in advance.\r\n\r\nAfter the interview, decisions about the offer of places are made immediately after the interviews and the outcomes communicated to candidates formally through UCAS Teacher Training.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You'll spend a total of 120 days in schools during the programme, supported by school mentors, class teachers and University-based tutors.","personalQualities":"We are looking for someone who is:\r\n- Motivated to work with young people and is enthusiastic about their subject\r\n- Adaptable, hardworking and committed to teaching all pupils\r\n- Able to think on their feet, with good communication skills and a sense of humour\r\n- Able to work as a member of a team as well as being independent and resourceful.\r\n- Be well qualified in your subject and to be able to talk about it with understanding and enthusiasm.
