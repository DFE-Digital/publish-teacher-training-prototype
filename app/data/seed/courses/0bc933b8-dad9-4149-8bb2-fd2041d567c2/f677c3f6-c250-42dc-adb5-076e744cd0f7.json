Part of this course also extends your studies and experience to cover preparation for post-16 teaching.

You’ll benefit from both a professional tutor and a subject-specific, personal mentor to guide you through your teaching practice.\r\n\r\nHull benefits from close partnerships with approximately 90 schools. These schools are largely based in the East Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire region, but we also work with schools as far apart as North and West Yorkshire, as well as schools deep into the Lincolnshire countryside. There’s an opportunity to gain experience across a variety of school and academy types: urban or rural, large or small, comprehensive or selective.\r\n\r\nYou’ll study the following areas:\r\n\r\nThe requirements of the National Curriculum and planning and assessment for GCSEs and A levels\r\nShakespeare – including collaborative practical sessions and an approach to play texts as enjoyable, popular, performance material needing interactive classroom activities\r\nEmphasis on your individual creativity in developing learning resources, with scope for additional specialisation in areas of personal interest, such as drama, media studies, or teenage fiction\r\nDevelopment of your critical literacy, through reflection on teaching methodologies and engagement with current research in the field\r\nTwo teaching practice placements offer experience of working in different kinds of schools\r\n\r\nTheory\r\nAssessment is based on a range of coursework assignments.\r\n\r\nPractice\r\nAssessment takes place in schools. You’ll also be assessed on your achievement of the Teachers’ Standards.\r\n\r\nPlease see full information on our webpage (https://www.hull.ac.uk/study/pgce/secondary-pgce-english.aspx)","interviewProcess":"On receipt of your application, it will be checked for the suitability of the academic qualifications, the quality of both the content and the accuracy of written English and the extent of support provided by the referee. This is always done by the Subject Tutor. Your application will also be seen by a School Mentor, and sometimes by the Programme Director.\r\n\r\nThe Department for Education stipulates that entrants to ITT must possess a first degree of a United Kingdom higher education institution or an equivalent qualification. The University requires that prospective applicants possess or are studying towards a 2:2 honours degree and have appropriate subject knowledge.  The University reserves the right to determine equivalent qualifications.  As we are flexible in our degree subject entry requirements, we suggest you speak to the subject method tutor Holly Smith at h.smith2@hull.ac.uk.\r\n\r\nYou will be interviewed on an individual basis with a Subject Tutor(s).  Currently, our interviews are being held virtually.\r\n\t\r\nThe interview process is informal and you will be offered the opportunity to ask questions about the programme.  You may be asked to deliver a short presentation on a topic agreed in advance.\r\n\r\nAfter the interview, decisions about the offer of places are made immediately after the interviews and the outcomes communicated to candidates formally through UCAS Teacher Training.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"A total of 120 days are spent in schools during the programme, supported by school mentors, class teachers and University-based tutors.","personalQualities":"We are looking for someone who is:\r\n- Motivated to work with young people and is enthusiastic about their subject\r\n- Adaptable, hardworking and committed to teaching all pupils\r\n- Able to think on their feet, with good communication skills and a sense of humour\r\n- Able to work as a member of a team as well as being independent and resourceful.\r\n- Be well qualified in your subject and to be able to talk about it with understanding and enthusiasm.
