We welcome trainees from across the world and from the beginning, the course is centred on the practical skills and techniques necessary for successful language teaching. We offer French, German and Spanish as both main and subsidiary languages. Some trainees work with all three languages, some with one language.\r\n\r\nPart of this course also extends your studies and experience to cover preparation for post-16 teaching. You’ll spend a third of your course studying at the University with dedicated subject tutors, and the remainder is spent on two teaching practices in two different schools. You’ll benefit from both a professional tutor and a subject-specific, personal mentor to guide you through your teaching practice.\r\n\r\nHull benefits from close partnerships with approximately 90 schools. These schools are largely based in the East Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire region, but we also work with schools as far apart as North and West Yorkshire, as well as schools deep into the Lincolnshire countryside. There’s an opportunity to gain experience across a variety of school and academy types: urban or rural, large or small, comprehensive or selective.\r\n\r\nThe programme seeks to identify the process of learning a second language. You’ll study the following areas:\r\n\r\nCritically review the various approaches, methods, techniques, and materials used in the teaching of foreign languages at secondary level\r\nExamples of methodology ranging from lively oral practice supported by interactive whiteboards, the use of new digital technology and games for beginners, to the exploitation of topic-based and literary texts at a sixth-form level\r\n\r\nPrepare your own teaching materials and to use a variety of teaching aids, including the latest digital technology\r\n\r\nTheory\r\nAssessment is based on a range of coursework assignments.\r\n\r\nPractice\r\nAssessment takes place in schools.
