IOE tutors are committed to promoting good interactive teaching and learning in their sessions, and a collaborative ethos is encouraged so that you share materials, resources and ideas with other student teachers.\r\nAt the UCL Institute of Education (IOE) you will participate in a range of lectures and seminars designed to enhance your development as a teacher. These highly interactive sessions will cover how children learn, assessment, lesson planning, behaviour management and subject-specific matters. The programme involves visits to sites around London as well as a wide range of guest speakers.\r\n\r\nWe draw on current research at the IOE and elsewhere to inform your social science teaching and encourage you to engage with recent debates and literature in the field. Our underlying aim is to develop you as a reflective and highly skilled teacher.\r\n\r\nIn our partner schools and colleges, you will teach mainly Psychology at AS and possibly A2 level. Whilst some schools also offer Psychology at GCSE, it would be extremely beneficial to be able to offer another subject within the field of social sciences and/or humanities. In some placements there are opportunities to contribute to relevant vocational qualifications, such as Health and Social Care or Child Development and PHSE.\r\n\r\nAt Key Stage 3, you may be required to teach some history, religious education or citizenship.\r\n\r\nYou will undertake two school placements during your PGCE training and these will be at two of our excellent alliance schools. Including: Alexandra Park School, Fortismere School, Woodside High School, Friern Barnet School, Park View School, Duke's Aldridge Academy, Highgate Wood School, Mill Hill County High and Christ's College Finchley.\r\n\r\nUCL Institute of Education (IOE) is a global leader in teacher education.  Their programmes are recognised by Ofsted as “outstanding” in very criterion across Primary and Secondary Education. All UCL School Direct students have full access to UCL student support services and facilities.\r\n\r\nThis programme follows the exact same structure as the PGCE route and awards the PGCE and QTS. The only difference is that students apply directly via UCAS to the school or alliance. Candidates will still attend the same university lectures.\r\n\r\n[Click here to search for full details of the Psychology course] (https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/courses/teacher-training)\r\n","interviewProcess":"Alexandra Park School is the lead school in the partnership and will be co-ordinating the recruitment process. This will involve attending an afternoon at one of the schools in the alliance and performing a variety of tasks, including some or all of the following: a short presentation, a lesson observation activity, a written feedback exercise, a group discussion activity and an interview.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the placement is at another school in the partnership, staff from that school will also be involved. If you are successful at the school interview, our university partner will also invite you to an interview day at the Institute of Education. This day will also serve as an opportunity to learn more about the PGCE course, the tutors and the facilities at the Institute.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will be trained in a supportive and aspirational environment and will develop the rigour, professional knowledge, understanding and skills necessary for the delivery of creative, purposeful and challenging teaching and learning.\r\n\r\nMost of the training will be delivered by expert teachers in the partnership schools. This will be enhanced by attendance at the university. You will be assigned to one of the schools in the partnership in which you will do a teaching placement in the autumn term. In the spring term you will do a teaching placement in another of our partner schools. All schools have comprehensive intakes and you will get experience of working with young people of all abilities. At least one of your placements will give you access to post-16 learners.\r\n\r\nYou can express a preference for a placement at a specific school in the partnership and we will endeavour to meet your request. You will have full access to the Institute of Education. The course is identical to the PGCE so you will attend the exact same lectures. Prior to each of your two teaching placements you will have two weeks' intensive preparation at the university. As with the PGCE, much of your training will take place within the school itself.\r\n\r\nYou will be assigned two mentors from the staff of your assigned school, one from your subject area and one from the senior leadership team. From the beginning, you will be treated like a member of staff and will attend staff meetings and development days. Our mentors are outstanding teachers but they are required to undertake a rigorous training programme to develop their mentoring skills. \r\n\r\nSuccessfully completing all aspects of the course will gain you the award of Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE), which also carries 60 M, level credits that may be used towards a subsequent Masters degree.  The course also leads to the award of QTS (Qualified Teacher Status).\r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for ambitious trainee teachers who are passionate and enthusiastic about their subject and have a desire to share that with young people of all abilities in the secondary age range. This will be demonstrated by meaningful experience of working with young people of this age. This does not need to be paid work but might be helping with a sports team, drama group or youth club. We would like you to have done some observation in a classroom or you may even have worked in a school.","otherRequirements":"","status":2,"createdAt":"2021-07-21T16:10:42.808Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2024"}
