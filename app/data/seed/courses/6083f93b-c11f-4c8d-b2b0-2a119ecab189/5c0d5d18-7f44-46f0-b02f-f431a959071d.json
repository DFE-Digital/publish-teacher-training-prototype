The experienced tutors at the IoE have previously been classroom teachers and heads of school departments and have worked in industry. They are actively involved in education research and work on national curriculum development. \r\n\r\nYou will acquire a critical understanding of current debates and issues relating to PSHE education and the tutors will guide and support you in developing your subject knowledge. You are expected to engage with reading and research in science education and to regularly reflect upon your own progress.\r\n\r\nThe placement schools you will be attending during your PGCE will be two from across our alliance of excellent schools. \r\nIncluding: Alexandra Park School, Fortismere School, Woodside High School, Friern Barnet School, Park View School, Greig City Academy, Duke's Aldridge Academy and Highgate Wood School.\r\n\r\nUCL Institute of Education (IOE) is a global leader in teacher education.  Their programmes are recognised by Ofsted as “outstanding” in every criterion across Primary and Secondary Education. All UCL School Direct students have full access to UCL student support services and facilities.\r\n\r\nThis programme follows the exact same structure as the PGCE route and awards the PGCE and QTS. The only difference is that students apply directly via UCAS to the school or alliance. Candidates will still attend the same university lectures.\r\n\r\n[Click here for full details of the Citizenship course](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/teacher-training-programmes/citizenship-school-direct-pgce)","interviewProcess":"Alexandra Park School is the lead school in the alliance and is responsible for coordinating the recruitment process. \r\n\r\nAll applications received are reviewed by the NRTA team.  If you are shortlisted, you will be invited to an interview and asked to perform a variety of tasks, which may include: a short presentation, a lesson activity, a literacy and maths exercise, a group discussion activity, and a panel interview.  The interview panel may include staff from partner schools as well as staff from Alexandra Park School.\r\n\r\nIf you are successful at the school interview, UCL IOE will invite you to an interview. This will also serve as an opportunity to learn more about the PGCE course, the tutors and the facilities at the Institute.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"On the school direct course, you will be trained in a supportive and aspirational environment.  You will develop the rigour, professional knowledge and skills necessary for the delivery of creative, purposeful and challenging teaching and learning.\r\n\r\nMost of the hands-on training will be delivered by expert teachers in our alliance of schools and this will be enhanced by studies at UCL IOE.\r\n\r\nYou will be assigned two school placements at two of our partner schools. The first being in the autumn term and the second in the spring term. All schools have comprehensive intakes and you will get experience of working with young people of all abilities. At least one of your placements will give you access to post-16 learners.\r\n\r\nYou will have full access to UCL IOE during your training. The school direct course format is identical to the PGCE offered by UCL IOE, so you will attend the same lectures and spend the same amount of time in schools. Prior to each of your two teaching placements, you will have approximately three weeks intensive preparation at university. As with the PGCE, much of your training will take place within the school itself.\r\n\r\nYou will be assigned two mentors from the staff of your assigned school, one from your subject area and one from the senior leadership team. From the beginning, you will be treated like a member of staff and will attend staff meetings and development days. Our mentors are outstanding teachers but they are required to undertake a rigorous training programme to develop their mentoring skills. \r\n\r\nSuccessfully completing all aspects of the course will gain you the award of Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE), which also carries 60 master level credits that may be used towards a subsequent Master’s degree.  The course also leads to the award of QTS (Qualified Teacher Status).\r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for ambitious trainee teachers who are passionate and enthusiastic about their subject and have a desire to share that with young people of all abilities in the secondary school age range. \r\n\r\nThis might be demonstrated by meaningful experience of working with young people in this age group. This does not need to be paid work but could be helping with a sports team, drama group or youth club. Ideally, we would like you to have done some observation in a classroom or you may even have worked in a school.\r\n","otherRequirements":"","status":0,"createdAt":"2021-07-21T16:10:42.852Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2024"}
