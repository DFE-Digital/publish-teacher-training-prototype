Religious education (RE) is a subject that embraces the opportunity to change and adapt to meet the needs of pupils in the 21st century. The course is committed to a multi-faith approach to teaching RE. The programme is taught by tutors with a wealth of experience, and by visiting colleagues who are actively engaged in research in religion and the teaching of RE. As well as having sessions at the UCL IOE, student teachers visit places of worship and meet with members of faith groups and others who support high standards of RE in schools. The underlying aim of the PGCE is to develop you as a reflective and highly skilled teacher.\r\n\r\nRE works when pupils are given the chance to debate the big questions about life, death and the universe. We will expect you to learn from your observations and from each other, in order to deliver RE that 'works'.\r\n\r\nYou will develop knowledge and understanding of the national curriculum, its targets and content, together with an understanding of wider statutory requirements. You will advance your teaching and classroom management skills to a high level, and enhance your capacity for self-reflection and further professional development.\r\n\r\nAt the IOE you will work in groups of approximately 20, with a team of tutors who have unparalleled experience and research interests in London schools. You will develop an understanding of classroom practice and theories underpinning teaching and learning. Tasks set throughout the year will help you to reflect on your own as well as children's learning and development.\r\n\r\nThe placement schools you will be attending during your PGCE will be two from across our alliance of excellent schools.  Including: Alexandra Park School, Fortismere School, Woodside High School, Friern Barnet School, Park View School, Greig City Academy, Duke's Aldridge Academy and Highgate Wood School.\r\n\r\nUCL Institute of Education (IOE) is a global leader in teacher education.  Their programmes are recognised by Ofsted as “outstanding” in every criterion across Primary and Secondary Education. All UCL School Direct students have full access to UCL student support services and facilities.\r\n\r\nThis programme follows the same structure as the PGCE route and awards the PGCE and QTS. The only difference is that students apply directly via UCAS to the school alliance. Candidates will still attend the same university lectures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Click here for full details of the Religious Education course](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/teacher-training-programmes/religious-education-school-direct-pgce)\r\n","interviewProcess":"Alexandra Park School is the lead school in the partnership and will be co-ordinating the recruitment process. This will involve attending an afternoon at one of the schools in the alliance and performing a variety of tasks, including some or all of the following: a short presentation, a lesson observation activity, a written feedback exercise, a group discussion activity and an interview.\r\n\r\nIf the placement is at another school in the partnership, staff from that school will also be involved. If you are successful at the school interview, our university partner will also invite you to an interview day at the Institute of Education. This day will also serve as an opportunity to learn more about the PGCE course, the tutors and the facilities at the Institute.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will be trained in a supportive and aspirational environment and will develop the rigour, professional knowledge, understanding and skills necessary for the delivery of creative, purposeful and challenging teaching and learning.\r\n\r\nMost of the training will be delivered by expert teachers in the partnership schools. This will be enhanced by attendance at the university. You will be assigned to one of the schools in the partnership in which you will do a teaching placement in the autumn term. In the spring term you will do a teaching placement in another of our partner schools. All schools have comprehensive intakes and you will get experience of working with young people of all abilities. At least one of your placements will give you access to post-16 learners.\r\n\r\nYou can express a preference for a placement at a specific school in the partnership and we will endeavour to meet your request. You will have full access to the Institute of Education. The course is identical to the PGCE so you will attend the exact same lectures. Prior to each of your two teaching placements you will have two weeks' intensive preparation at the university. As with the PGCE, much of your training will take place within the school itself.\r\n\r\nYou will be assigned two mentors from the staff of your assigned school, one from your subject area and one from the senior leadership team. From the beginning, you will be treated like a member of staff and will attend staff meetings and development days. Our mentors are outstanding teachers but they are required to undertake a rigorous training programme to develop their mentoring skills. \r\n\r\nSuccessfully completing all aspects of the course will gain you the award of Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE), which also carries 60 M, level credits that may be used towards a subsequent Masters degree.  The course also leads to the award of QTS (Qualified Teacher Status).\r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for ambitious trainee teachers who are passionate and enthusiastic about their subject and have a desire to share that with young people of all abilities in the secondary age range. This will be demonstrated by meaningful experience of working with young people of this age. This does not need to be paid work but might be helping with a sports team, drama group or youth club. We would like you to have done some observation in a classroom or you may even have worked in a school.","status":2,"createdAt":"2021-07-21T16:10:42.738Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2023"}
