The course will help you to explore the purpose of teaching geography, developing your own philosophy for why a geographical education is important for young people.\r\n\r\nYou will be encouraged to engage in contemporary debates, reflecting critically and becoming an active 'curriculum-maker' with the ability to plan and develop innovative and exciting geography. Although the main age range is 11 to 16, we also explore the opportunities offered by geography for the 16 to 19 age group. The course expects exceptionally high standards in terms of presentation skills, planning and preparation: every year students are encouraged to publish work. The course introduces you to research in geography education, through engagement in small-scale studies in your school's geography department. The programme is designed to foster interest and expertise in geography education, and many graduates go on to complete their MA Geography Education. Information and communications technology is an important element of the course. We encourage you to use ICT in an innovative and imaginative way, particularly for teaching with geographic information systems (GIS). Fieldwork, including residential fieldwork is also an essential part of the course. You will teach a range of geographical topics and learn to use a range of techniques, strategies and approaches for high quality Geography.\r\n\r\nYou will undertake two school placements during your training and these will be at two of our excellent alliance schools. One long placement and a shorter 6 week placement at a second school. Including: Alexandra Park School, Fortismere School, Woodside High School, Friern Barnet School, Park View School, Duke's Aldridge Academy, Highgate Wood School, Mill Hill County High and Christ's College Finchley.\r\n\r\nAll Middlesex Salaried School Direct students have full access to Middlesex student support services/facilities.\r\n\r\nThis programme awards the PG Cert Teaching award. The only difference is students apply directly via UCAS to the school or alliance. Candidates will still attend the same university lectures.

This will involve attending an afternoon at one of the schools in the alliance and performing a variety of tasks, including some or all of the following: a short presentation, a lesson observation activity, a written feedback exercise, a group discussion activity and an interview.\r\n\r\nIf the placement is at another school in the partnership, staff from that school may also be involved. If you are successful at the school interview, our university partner will also invite you to an interview and this will also serve as an opportunity to learn more about the PGCert course, the tutors and the facilities at the University.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will be trained in a highly supportive and aspirational environment and will develop the rigour, professional knowledge, understanding and skills necessary for the delivery of creative, purposeful and challenging teaching and learning. The placement schools you will be attending during your PGCE will be from across our alliance of good and outstanding schools. Prior to each of your two teaching placements, you will have several weeks of intensive preparation at university where you will study the theory and pedagogy behind becoming an outstanding teacher. \r\n\r\nYou can express a preference for a placement at a specific school in the partnership and we shall endeavour to match school placements with a particular student teacher's strengths. We do, however, have to take into consideration the ever-changing nature of the schools and work around curriculum and staffing changes. The aim of Schools Direct is to allow participants to train in schools which are local to them to increase recruitment opportunities upon completion of the course.\r\n\r\nWe aim to give all participants two contrasting experiences within their placements; whether that be with regards to student intake, uniform/non-uniform, post-16 education or a faith-based curriculum. You will be assigned a subject mentor from within your department at both of your placement schools and will attend regular Professional Studies sessions to equip you with the skills to plan and teach your lessons. Our mentors are excellent teachers who are required to undertake a rigorous training programme to develop their mentoring skills. You will also have many opportunities to observe and learn from other teachers throughout both placements.\r\n\r\nYou will also return to university at regular intervals throughout the year to continue your academic studies and discuss your experiences with your fellow participants. Successful completion of all aspects of the course will gain you the final award. \r\n","personalQualities":"","otherRequirements":"","status":2,"createdAt":"2021-07-21T16:10:44.020Z","canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","cycle":"2023","salaryDetails":"Approximately Â£21,500"}
