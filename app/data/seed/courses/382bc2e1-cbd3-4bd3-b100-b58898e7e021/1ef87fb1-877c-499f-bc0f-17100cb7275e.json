Successful completion of your PGCE course prepares you to start your first teaching post within a primary school setting. Our course is designed to prepare you to teach pupils in the 5-11 age range.\r\nThe course programme is divided into two main themes:\r\n•\tDeveloping Primary Curriculum Knowledge\r\nWe'll develop your subject content and pedagogical knowledge to support effective teaching across the primary curriculum. You will gain a comprehensive knowledge of the core subjects (English, Mathematics and Science) and the full breadth of the National Curriculum. You'll be encouraged to further develop your personal subject knowledge, skills and understanding and to develop subject specific teaching strategies to support pupils’ progress.\r\n•\tSupporting Learning and Progress in the Primary School\r\nWe’ll prepare you for the classroom, allowing you to develop your teaching skills and understanding of how to meet the needs of all learners. \r\nThemes include \r\n*How young people learn,\r\n*Teaching and learning techniques to support pupils’ progress; \r\n*Behaviour management\r\n*Assessment, \r\n*Inclusive, creative and innovative teaching methods and how to plan lessons. \r\n\r\nYou will research evidence based learning theories, gain a greater understanding of current professional issues in primary schools and begin to develop your own educational philosophy.\r\nYou’ll learn in friendly and supportive groups, designed to give you the confidence to succeed. Course tutors are experienced teachers and you’ll have a personal academic tutor to support you through your studies. Teaching is through workshops, tutorials and lectures, some with guest speakers, and through group work with other trainee teachers.\r\n\r\nAssessment is typically through the completion of a range of classroom activities, written assignments, reports, personal subject audits and the development of portfolios of evidence. There are no formal examinations and the assignments are carefully designed to help you to develop your teaching practice further. Upon successful completion of the programme we recommend Qualified Teaching Status be awarded by the Department for Education.\r\nTwo of the PGCE modules are at Master’s level and you’ll have the opportunity to continue your studies further to complete a Master’s degree, supporting your NQT year and early professional development.\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"You will be shortlisted for interview based on your application. The following selection procedures are designed to assess your suitability to train to teach:\r\n•\tYou will have an interview with a member of the course team\r\n•\tYou will be asked to prepare and lead an activity with a small group of children in one of our partnership schools\r\n•\tComplete tasks designed to evaluate your fundamental English and mathematics skills\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"For all trainees, their school based training is the central element of their initial teacher education. You will undertake at least two compulsory placements as part of your course and will spend a total of 120 days in at least two schools. You’ll benefit from being able to observe experienced teachers, from practical hands-on experience and from supportive mentoring to help you to develop into a confident and successful teacher.\r\nYou’ll experience the wider role of a teacher in primary education. You’ll have the support of mentors in schools who will help you to develop your practice through observations, planning meetings, weekly tutorials, reports and in-depth lesson evaluations.\r\nYour university tutor will visit you in school to guide, support and evaluate your progress. There is an emphasis on practical engagement with the curriculum whilst developing your understanding of the theoretical perspectives which underpin the best models of classroom practice.\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"You must demonstrate the ability to communicate effectively, and that you have the intellectual and academic capabilities to meet the required Teachers' Standards by the end of the programme.\r\nPlease spend some time gaining experience in a primary school to give you a greater insight into your career choice & help you decide whether teaching is right for you.  Other areas of experience may also support your application.","otherRequirements":"Offers will be subject to satisfactory Disclosure and Barring Service enhanced disclosure check and trainees must not previously have been barred from teaching or working with children.
