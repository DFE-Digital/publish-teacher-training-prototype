We offer personalised training to develop teaching skills within a wide range of settings. \r\nWe work in close association with BCU so all  students are supported with academic studies, career guidance and pastoral care. \r\nTrainees will be placed with a well-qualified teacher and trained about all aspects of primary teaching and learning. They develop their knowledge and understanding of teacher standards,  pedagogy and how  primary pupils learn. Trainees are observed  regularly  by highly qualified teachers who give personalised targets which develop trainee's knowledge and understanding. Most training will happen at the main school allocated but trainees will visit other venues during the training. There will be block placements at BCU who  will set the assignments and inform all trainees about when they need to submit and the grade criteria. At BCU trainees study three modules - Core Curriculum, Foundation Curriculum and Professional Studies and Leadership which are assessed and graded by BCU. The range of assignments involve an essay, cross-phase curriculum map and presentation. There is one assignment per term for which guidance and support is given to the trainee.\r\nBCU has been graded 17th nationally and 1st in the West Midlands for teacher training provision.\r\nThe Greenholm and BCU collaboration has resulted in a good programme (Ofsted grading), with excellent completion rates and 100% employability rates.
