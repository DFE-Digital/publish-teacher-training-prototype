We offer personalised training to develop teaching skills within a wide range of settings. \r\nWe work in close association with Services for Education (SFE) so all  students are supported with academic studies, career guidance and pastoral care. \r\nTrainees will be placed with a well-qualified teacher and trained about all aspects of primary teaching and learning. They develop their knowledge and understanding of teacher standards,  pedagogy and how  primary pupils learn. Trainees are observed  regularly  by highly qualified teachers who give personalised targets which develop trainee's knowledge and understanding. Most training will happen at the main school allocated but trainees will visit other venues during the training.During the training year, the focus is on getting trainees classroom ready.  The centre based programme is complimented with the school based support from  highly qualified teachers.  The content of the course includes  but not limited to: Numeracy, Literacy and phonics, Science, behaviour management, Child development, Emotional literacy, PSHE, Fundamental British values, Physical Education, Vocal training, SEND, EAL, Humanities through theme based work, Art, Music and assessment and reporting both for personalising learning, but also to comply with statutory requirements.\r\n70% of the course is spent in schools, learning from and with practitioners, leading learning and supporting pupil progress.  The  amount of time spent  per week in school increases across the length of the programme, so  the experience of teaching is as realistic as possible.\r\nTrainees are continual assessed across the year.
