We offer personalised training to develop teaching skills within a wide range of settings. \r\nWe work in close association with BCU so all  students are supported with academic studies, career guidance and pastoral care. \r\nTrainees will be placed with a well-qualified teacher and trained about all aspects of primary teaching and learning. They develop their knowledge and understanding of teacher standards,  pedagogy and how  primary pupils learn. Trainees are observed  regularly  by highly qualified teachers who give personalised targets which develop trainee's knowledge and understanding. Most training will happen at the main school allocated but trainees will visit other venues during the training. There will be block placements at BCU who  will set the assignments and inform all trainees about when they need to submit and the grade criteria. At BCU trainees study three modules - Core Curriculum, Foundation Curriculum and Professional Studies and Leadership which are assessed and graded by BCU. The range of assignments involve an essay, cross-phase curriculum map and presentation. There is one assignment per term for which guidance and support is given to the trainee.\r\nBCU has been graded 17th nationally and 1st in the West Midlands for teacher training provision.\r\nThe Greenholm and BCU collaboration has resulted in a good programme (Ofsted grading), with excellent completion rates and 100% employability rates.  We pride ourselves on our pastoral care, making sure that at any stage in the trainees development they are seen as an individual and support is available to them. We have a strong partnership with our training schools, and many of our trainees go on to work in the partnership  schools. Many previous trainees are now in senior managerial positions due to the strong and effective start they receive during their training year.\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Candidates will be interviewed by a panel including headteachers from within the partnership and representatives from BCU .

All placements are within the primary phase and trainees teach pupils between the ages of 4- 7 years of age with a range of abilities and disabilities. \r\nGreenholm endeavours to  support the needs of the trainee and the requirement  of the primary school when allocating placements, we try to allocate schools close to trainee's home address, for both the main placement and second placement, if it is possible.\r\nOur partnership of schools extends all across Birmingham with a wide range of primary schools.","personalQualities":"Candidates will :\r\nHave excellent speaking and written skills. \r\nExcellent numeracy and ICT skills. \r\nBe inspirational and aspirational. \r\nWork effectively in a team. \r\nMake decisions, problem-solve, have and show empathy. \r\nBe hardworking. \r\nBe dynamic. \r\nBe creative. \r\nBe flexible. \r\nBe enthusiastic. \r\nListen well. \r\nBe determined to achieve and do the best for the pupils within the partnership\r\nStrive for excellence. \r\nBe caring. \r\nBe emotionally literate. \r\nShow leadership skills. \r\nHave a 'can do' attitude and be up for a challenge. \r\nBe someone who wants to give children in their care the best start to life that they can. \r\nHave some school experience","otherRequirements":"All trainees are DBS checked and will need to complete CDF form\r\nIf they have been out of the country for more than 3 months, potential candidate needs to provide a certificate of good conduct from the embassy of the country they visited.\r\nIt is beneficial if trainees have some experience either salaried or voluntary of working within a primary school.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-08-01T15:17:18.210Z","updatedAt":"2021-08-18T14:45:02.361Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2024"}
