Training is divided into 4 parts: Core Training Days, University Days, Placement 1 and Placement 2.\r\n\r\nCore Training Days - At the start of the programme, you will experience an intensive, immersive induction into the world of teaching and learning with Core Training Days. Both by developing your existing knowledge, and introducing you to practical concepts and applications in the classroom, you will be encouraged to establish and develop solid foundations in readiness for your school placements.\r\n\r\nUniversity Days - University days provide a valuable opportunity to study and learn your craft – both subject specific and pedagogy – through collaboration with trainees within and beyond the Alliance.\r\n\r\nPlacement 1 - You will begin with collaborative work and observation, and teaching will range from 25% to 50% by the end of the first placement, combining collaborative and solo training.\r\n\r\nPlacement 2 - During this placement, collaborative and solo teaching will increase to up to 60% by the end of your placement. This placement generally takes place during the first half of the Spring term.\r\n","personalQualities":"We will look for evidence of a commitment to the teaching profession, an understanding of professional requirements, and an awareness of current educational issues in an application. Prior experience in a school is not required, however prospective students may find experience in a school useful for obtaining insights into the primary education classroom. Experience in a school or similar setting may also provide reassurance to prospective students that teaching is the right choice for their career.","otherRequirements":"If you accept an offer of a place you will be required to complete a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) criminal records check and Prohibition Order check. If you have spent time overseas in the last 5 years you may also be required to obtain criminal records checks from each of the countries you visited.
