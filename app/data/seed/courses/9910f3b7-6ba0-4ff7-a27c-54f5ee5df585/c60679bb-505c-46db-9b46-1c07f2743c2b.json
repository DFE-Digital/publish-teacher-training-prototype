Course fees are paid by the trainee and funding may be available through tuition fee loans, bursaries or scholarships.\r\n\r\nThe training programme is designed to support academic-based assignments and practical teaching experience.  It will consist of: subject-specific sessions taught throughout the year at both the university and partnership schools; training within a host school; classroom teaching in two contrasting schools and lesson observations.  \r\n\r\nSuccessful completion of the course leads to Qualified Teacher Status, a Postgraduate Certificate in Education and students are also able to accrue credits towards a Master’s Level Degree.\r\n\r\nSee our website for more information (https://ruralschoolsalliance.co.uk/)\r\n","interviewProcess":"All shortlisted applicants are interviewed prior to the formal offer of a training place with the Rural Schools Alliance.\r\n\r\nInterviews for a placement with the Rural Schools Alliance may include any combination of the following:\r\n- A tour of the school to meet pupils and staff\r\n- Small group or whole class teaching\r\n- A group discussion with an educational focus\r\n- A written task to show that you are able to write English clearly without errors of spelling, grammar or punctuation\r\n- A subject-specific verbal presentation\r\n- A formal interview (the panel will normally contain the Director of the Rural Schools Alliance, a Professional Mentor, a Subject Leader and a representative from the University of Winchester)\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The Rural Schools Alliance is a partnership of six rural secondary schools all based within Hampshire. Training is divided into 4 parts: Core Training Days, University Days, Placement 1 and Placement 2.\r\n\r\nCore Training Days - At the start of the programme, you will experience an intensive, immersive induction into the world of teaching and learning with Core Training Days. Both by developing your existing knowledge, and introducing you to practical concepts and applications in the classroom, you will be encouraged to establish and develop solid foundations in readiness for your school placements.\r\n\r\nUniversity Days - University days provide a valuable opportunity to study and learn your craft – both subject specific and pedagogy – through collaboration with trainees within and beyond the Alliance.\r\n\r\nPlacement 1 - You will begin with collaborative work and observation, and teaching will range from 25% to 50% by the end of the first placement, combining collaborative and solo training.\r\n\r\nPlacement 2 - During this placement, collaborative and solo teaching will increase to up to 60% by the end of your placement. This placement generally takes place during the first half of the Spring term.\r\n","personalQualities":"We will look for evidence of a commitment to the teaching profession, an understanding of professional requirements, and an awareness of current educational issues in an application. Prior experience in a school is not required, however prospective students may find experience in a school useful for obtaining insights into the primary education classroom. Experience in a school or similar setting may also provide reassurance to prospective students that teaching is the right choice for their career.","otherRequirements":"If you accept an offer of a place you will be required to complete a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) criminal records check and Prohibition Order check. If you have spent time overseas in the last 5 years you may also be required to obtain criminal records checks from each of the countries you visited.
