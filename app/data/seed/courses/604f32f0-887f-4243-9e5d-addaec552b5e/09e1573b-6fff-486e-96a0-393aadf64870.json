The first is the home address of the trainee. We want to ensure that your travel time is accessible and not too time constraining. The second is the availability of a Partnership school in your location. We always limit travel time to no more than 1 hour from home. We will let you know your placement as soon as possible.\r\nWe have a map of all our Primary and Secondary schools on our website \r\n - www.southbirminghamscitt.org.uk  We have a wide selection of Primary  and Secondary Schools to choose placements from -  new schools ask to join us all the time!\r\n\r\nThe majority of our trainees will complete a short placement in the Autumn term and will then be placed in their main school for the Spring and Summer Terms.  We need to ensure that the short placement will give you a contrasting experience - this may mean different size, socio-economic catchment, faith/non-faith for example. This will mean a slightly different journey for you, but we will always ensure that it is accessible, for example if you don’t drive.  \r\n","personalQualities":"* Enthusiasm \r\n* Dedication \r\n* Sense of humour\r\n* Passion\r\n* Resilience\r\n* Organisation\r\n* Patience\r\n* Professionalism\r\n* Reflective practice\r\n\r\nCheck out our website –  www.southbirminghamscitt.org.uk\r\n","otherRequirements":"If you studied outside of the UK, you will need to visit NARIC (www.naric.org.uk), as a certificate of proof for equivalence will need to be obtained. \r\n\r\nWe do not expect you to have school experience upon application.
