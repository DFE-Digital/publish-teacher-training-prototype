You will have the opportunity to observe good teachers at work and be able to work alongside them, gradually developing your own teaching skills. You will receive high quality mentoring, together with support from the SCITT team to enable you to develop into a competent and confident newly qualified teacher.\r\n\r\nTrainees will have half a term of workshops in primary subjects, based mainly at Beacon View Primary Academy, followed by half a term of teacher training in their placement school. Trainees will complete their practice at Early Years and Key Stages 1. A total of three teaching practices is required and will cover the age range of 3-7. Two practices will take place in one school and one practice in another, which should have a contrasting age range and catchment area to the first school.\r\n\r\nAssessment is based on trainees’ ability to meet the standards in Professional Standards for Qualified Teacher Status and Requirements for Initial Teacher Training. Trainees are required to write two assignments based on classroom research embedded in primary practice. In addition, trainees make presentations based on their knowledge of English, mathematics and science.","interviewProcess":"Candidates are selected for interview from those applications forwarded on to the Principal from UCAS.

Most schools are based in Portsmouth. Placements are made on an individual basis, considering: distance from home; careful pairing of mentors with trainees and various other factors which will give trainees the best school based experience possible.\r\n\r\nFurther information about placements schools can be found on our website, www.portsmouthscitt.co.uk.\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"","otherRequirements":"Our expectation is that prospective candidates will have some knowledge of what it is like to work in a primary or early years classroom, either on a voluntary basis or possibly working as a Learning Support Assistant.\r\n\r\nTo also be competent and confident in the use of ICT.\r\n\r\nYou must obtain an Enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service check (DBS) and an Occupational Health Assessment to assess fitness for teaching.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:52.608Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-01T09:00:35.214Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"}
