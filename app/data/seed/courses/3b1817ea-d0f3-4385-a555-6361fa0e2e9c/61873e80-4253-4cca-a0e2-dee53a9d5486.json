Biology sessions will  look at ways of teaching, with a focus on pedagogical themes. Typical topics for sessions include:\r\n\r\n* Safety and risk assessment in the laboratory; working with a technician\r\n* Using cells as an example, we look at how themes in Biology evolve through the key stages, we examine how to organise a scheme of work and how to use models to teach concepts such as cell structure and function and DNA structure, replication and protein synthesis.\r\n* Assessment for Learning (AFL) through the medium of cells and microscope use\r\n* Learning through self-discovery within evolution and using statistics in Biology through the topic of variation.\r\n* A focus on Scientific investigation skills. Looking at class practicals on enzymes – how to organise a class practical and monitor students.\r\n* A tour of the body systems; looking at modelling Biology through practical demonstrations and student centred practicals which link to the theory and allow application of knowledge and understanding.\r\n* Dissection – an outdated mode of practical teaching or as relevant as ever in the Biology laboratory? Ethics and dissection ‘refusers’ will be discussed\r\n* Plant Biology (Botany) – using SAPS methodology to bring to life the fascinating world of plants (a topic that so many biology teachers undersell). A practical approach.\r\n* Exam technique and revision – how do we prepare our students for the exam?\r\n\t\r\nThese sessions are delivered by a Biology Subject Expert in one of the Ormiston East Academies, therefore you are required to travel to this school for the delivery of these sessions (5 across the year)\r\n\r\nAn important part of the course is learning how to create a stimulating and caring environment. To help create such an environment, you need to be enthusiastic and lessons need to be well planned and related to the needs of pupils. They need to be conducted in a well-organised way with a positive approach to control. You will be able to prepare in advance for handling different situations since strategies for maintaining discipline and managing the learning in a laboratory are considered and discussed.\r\n\r\nWe also place emphasis on the development of your skills in Digital Technologies  and provide a wealth of opportunities for you to become a highly competent, skilled technology user.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Our selection process is a two way process where you can find out if the OAKS Norfolk is the training programme for you and we can decide if you can potentially become a highly effective secondary teacher.  We always carry out our interviews in one of our partnership schools, where you will be expected to teach either a class or a small group of their students for 15 minutes.  The students give us feedback on your lesson, which we share with you during a formal interview.  This interview then focuses on your lesson, your subject knowledge and your commitment to teach.  There are also written tasks for you to complete; these include a written subject specific activity and a generic writing task.  The whole process should take no more than half a day at the school.  You are interviewed by partnership school staff and OAKS tutors, who will talk through the programme and school placements. There will always be plenty of time for you to ask questions and the decision as to whether you are accepted on to the course is usually made on the same day (this may vary depending on the subject/time of year).\r\n\r\nWe want the interview to be a very positive experience for you. Please arrive promptly and formal dress is expected.  We look forward to meeting you!\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We will send you to two secondary schools where you will receive an 11-16 experience; the time spent in both of these placements is the same.  Hopefully they will give you two contrasting experiences whilst providing a level of stability and progression through the close working relationships between your two schools.  We make sure that you also receive a pre and post phase enhancement. For this you will be placed in a primary school for one week and gain experience in a post-16 environment (possibly in one of your secondary placements).  We are very proud of our alternative education placements that we arrange for you on our programme.  Hopefully you will gain experience in an EAL school, pupil referral unit (PRU), special school and an independent school.  \r\n\r\nTravel to and from your placements is always a key concern and we make every effort to make sure that you can easily commute to your schools.  Our partnership schools are all based in or around Norwich, Greater Yarmouth and Lowestoft. We will endeavour to keep your travel time to a minimum and never more than 75 minutes with the overwhelming majority being significantly lower than this.  When we visit our EAL schools we will travel together on a mini bus to allow collaboration but also to venture further to maximise the experience without expecting you to arrange travel.\r\n\r\nThrough undertaking regular evaluations, all of our partnership schools are deemed to be at least \"very good training experiences\" for our trainee teachers. We know high quality mentoring is key to a successful training year and take this very seriously. We train and then monitor all of our school based mentors and the quality of our school’s provision annually; so rest assured that you will have a good teaching experience with us at the OAKS Norfolk.\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"* Highly motivated individuals who want to make a positive contribution to the education of young people.       \r\n* Trainees who are passionate about their own specialism subject, with excellent subject knowledge.  \r\n* Able to inspire their learners and create an environment where everyone wants to succeed.       \r\n* Enthusiasm and a willingness to participate in the all aspects of the training course.       \r\n* Robus and resilient who want to make a difference in the classroom.       \r\n*Reflective on their own practice and take constructive feedback on board to help their rapid development as teachers.\r\n* Ambition to become highly effective classroom practitioners\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"* a satisfactory  medical report;\r\n* a completed DBS enhanced disclosure which is deemed satisfactory by the The OAKS Norfolk;\r\n* a successful completion of a minimum of 10 days teaching experience in a secondary school/college during the last two years. This could be either before or after selection (undertaking this before the selection process commences will strengthen your application).\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:51:56.976Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-28T11:31:33.279Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2023"}
