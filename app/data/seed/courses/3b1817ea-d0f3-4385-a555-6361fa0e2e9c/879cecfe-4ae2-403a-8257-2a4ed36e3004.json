Whatever your background, you will have a love of music and an enthusiasm for performance and a passion for conveying this to pupils and students.\r\n\r\nMusic is an universal language that embodies one of the highest forms of creativity.  A high-quality music education should engage and inspire pupils to develop a love of music and their talent as musicians, and so increase their self-confidence, creativity and sense of achievement. As pupils progress, they should develop critical engagement with music, allowing them to compose, and to listen with discrimination to the best in the musical canon.\r\n\r\nHaving an identity as a ‘musician in the classroom’, and the ability to aid creative music-making, are essential to a successful Music teacher. You will build on your existing skills as a musician and develop your subject knowledge in areas of weakness. You should be open to experiencing different styles and genres of music, and be prepared to broaden your musical horizon.  \r\n\r\nTopic and themes of the Music sessions are:\r\n\r\n* All things vocal\r\n* Transition work and primary links\r\n* Working with Technology\r\n* Building Resources\r\n* Practical conducting skills\r\n* Outstanding Music Teaching\r\n\r\nAn important part of the course is learning to create a stimulating and caring environment. To help create such an environment, you need to be enthusiastic and lessons need to be well planned and related to the needs of pupils. They need to be conducted in a well-organised way with a positive approach to control. You will be able to prepare in advance for handling different situations, develop strategies for maintaining discipline and managing the learning in a practical musical environment.\r\nKey models for the teaching of Music are analysed and different styles of teaching are explored. You will be encouraged to read widely and to employ Information and Communication Technology (ICT), role-play and audio-visual aids such as electronic whiteboards in the classroom.\r\n\r\nThese sessions are delivered by a Music Subject Expert in Schools, therefore you are required to travel to Stafford and Wolverhampton for the delivery of these sessions. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, the course aims to help you become a competent, professional and, above all, creative teacher, capable of developing the imaginations and abilities of the young people with whom you have the privilege of working.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Our selection process is a two way process where you can find out if the OAKS Norfolk is the training programme for you and we can decide if you can potentially become a highly effective secondary teacher.  We always carry out our interviews in one of our partnership schools, where you will be expected to teach either a class or a small group of their students for 15 minutes.  The students give us feedback on your lesson, which we share with you during a formal interview.  This interview then focuses on your lesson, your subject knowledge and your commitment to teach.  There are also written tasks for you to complete; these include a written subject specific activity and a generic writing task.  The whole process should take no more than half a day at the school.  You are interviewed by partnership school staff and OAKS tutors, who will talk through the programme and school placements. There will always be plenty of time for you to ask questions and the decision as to whether you are accepted on to the course is usually made on the same day (this may vary depending on the subject/time of year).\r\n\r\nWe want the interview to be a very positive experience for you. Please arrive promptly and formal dress is expected.  We look forward to meeting you!\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We will send you to two secondary schools where you will receive an 11-16 experience; the time spent in both of these placements is the same.  Hopefully they will give you two contrasting experiences whilst providing a level of stability and progression through the close working relationships between your two schools.  We make sure that you also receive a pre and post phase enhancement. For this you will be placed in a primary school for one week and gain experience in a post-16 environment (possibly in one of your secondary placements).  We are very proud of our alternative education placements that we arrange for you on our programme.  Hopefully you will gain experience in an EAL school, pupil referral unit (PRU), special school and an independent school.  \r\n\r\nTravel to and from your placements is always a key concern and we make every effort to make sure that you can easily commute to your schools.  Our partnership schools are all based in or around Norwich, Greater Yarmouth and Lowestoft. We will endeavour to keep your travel time to a minimum and never more than 75 minutes with the overwhelming majority being significantly lower than this.  When we visit our EAL schools we will travel together on a mini bus to allow collaboration but also to venture further to maximise the experience without expecting you to arrange travel.\r\n\r\nThrough undertaking regular evaluations, all of our partnership schools are deemed to be at least \"very good training experiences\" for our trainee teachers. We know high quality mentoring is key to a successful training year and take this very seriously. We train and then monitor all of our school based mentors and the quality of our school’s provision annually; so rest assured that you will have a good teaching experience with us at the OAKS Norfolk.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-11-29T10:02:09.897Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-29T10:03:55.916Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2024"}
