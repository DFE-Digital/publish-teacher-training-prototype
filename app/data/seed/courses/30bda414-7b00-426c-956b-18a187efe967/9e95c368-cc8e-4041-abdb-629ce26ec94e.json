We place an emphasis on teaching in an urban, multicultural environment, which is ideal if you want to teach in a city setting. \r\n\r\nOur trainees are high achievers, with 95% receiving an Ofsted good or outstanding grade by the end of the course, and 96% obtaining employment, many in their placement schools. \r\n\r\nThis course is exciting and challenging, so it's the perfect preparation for your career in teaching. \r\n\r\nThe course has two modules designed to help you develop an understanding of your future role as a primary school teacher. This structure gives you room to develop your classroom practice, as well as examine the underlying principles and values around educational issues. \r\n\r\nThe Curriculum Studies module introduces you to the issues of teaching within urban, multicultural and multilingual schools. You'll address the challenges of language, diversity and equality across the curriculum and learn how to teach core subjects including English, mathematics and science. \r\n\r\nThe Professionalism and Inclusive Practice (PIP) module includes your two extended school placements of 11 and 13 weeks.

University tutors will also teach your university sessions, ensuring there is continuity of support throughout your training. By working in both a school and a university environment, you have the chance to reflect on the links between your own teaching theory and practice. \r\n\r\nWith its educational links and high-quality teaching, this course is highly rated by Ofsted, who praised the 'inclusive, welcoming and open ethos and culture created by course leaders.
