We place an emphasis on teaching in an urban and multicultural environment, which is ideal for teaching in a city setting. \r\n\r\nYou'll undertake two school placements of 10 and 14 weeks, giving you hands-on practical experience and skills to become a competent maths teacher of 11 to 16-year-olds. By arrangement, you may also have the opportunity to work with 16 to 18-year-olds.\r\n\r\nDuring university-based sessions on our Holloway campus, you’ll develop teaching strategies, pedagogical techniques and discover the fundamentals of how children learn. These sessions include collaborative projects and school-based projects with other trainee teachers, as well as learning the principles of teaching and pupil assessment.\r\n* Curriculum studies will introduce you to the issues of teaching within urban, multicultural and multilingual schools. You'll address the challenges of language, diversity and equality across the curriculum and learn how to teach with these in mind. You’ll also ensure that your subject knowledge is up-to-date and relevant, plus be able to explore some of the latest education research.\r\n* Professionalism and Inclusive Practice (PIP) develops your understanding of the broader contexts of teaching, including the range of responsibilities on teachers. You'll make links to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), giving you a framework for meeting the needs of all students. By also undertaking a research project, you can engage with a topic of your choice in greater depth.\r\n\r\nThroughout your school placements, our school-based mentors and university tutors will support you in the classroom. University tutors will also teach university sessions, ensuring the support is consistent. By working in both environments, you have the chance to reflect on the links between your own teaching practice and relate this to teaching theory. \r\n\r\nWith its high-quality teaching, this course is highly rated by Ofsted, who praised the 'inclusive, welcoming and open ethos and culture created by course leaders. Combined with the tailored and personalised support trainees receive, which enables them to successfully complete their training and confidently go on to gain employment.'

Shortlisted applicants will be invited to an online interview and to complete online maths and English assessments. If you've applied to multiple routes of the same course offered by London Met (ie directly to London Met and also to one of our partner schools for the same subject) you'll only need to attend one interview. \r\n\r\nOnce you've completed your interview, we will normally confirm the decision through UCAS within one week. If you're offered a place at London Met, we will additionally email you to confirm how to meet any conditions of your offer. \r\n\r\nIf you're unsuccessful at any stage, the decision will be communicated through UCAS. We do try to indicate a reason in UCAS as to why we haven't been able to offer you a place. \r\n\r\nIf you have any queries relating to your application, please contact the Course Enquiries Team at London Met, even if you applied to a specific school for a course accredited by London Met.

Once you've met the conditions of your offer, we will send you a placement form to complete about where you're based, modes of transport you have access to and any other information, so that we can arrange placements that are appropriate for you. \r\n\r\nIf you've applied to a particular school, your placements may not necessarily be in that school but may be in partner schools attached to that school.
