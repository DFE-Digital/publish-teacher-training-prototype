It prepares you to teach 11 to 16-year-olds, while also giving you the opportunity to teach at a college level by arrangement. \r\n\r\nYou’ll learn to equip pupils with a strong command of the spoken and written language, and to promote high standards of literacy. This will help develop school pupils’ love of literature for their own enjoyment, alongside developing an interest in media studies.\r\n\r\nWe run this course in collaboration with the English and Media Centre (EMC), an award-winning educational charity. EMC tutors will provide you with support throughout the course, drawing on their extensive experience of consultancy for schools and running Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for teachers. You’ll continue to receive support from a dedicated EMC tutor throughout your school experience.\r\n\r\nThis PGCE course benefits from our London location and will broaden your understanding of teaching in multicultural and diverse urban environments. Through study, discussion and teaching, you’ll develop an understanding of how children learn and the methods you can use to help them to effectively develop their English and media skills.\r\n\r\nWe place great emphasis on sharing feedback with your peers and colleagues. You’ll complete a weekly reflection and contribute to discussions online in order to further develop your understanding of the role of a secondary teacher.\r\n\r\nIn the university-based sessions at our Holloway campus, you’ll develop your teaching strategies and pedagogical techniques, as well as discovering the fundamentals of how pupils learn. These sessions will include collaborative projects and school-based projects with other trainees, learning about the principles of teaching, as well as pupil assessment.\r\n\r\nThroughout your school placements, our school-based mentors and university tutors will support you in the classroom. University tutors will also teach your university sessions, ensuring there is continuity in the support you receive. By gaining experience both in the classroom and at university, you have the chance to reflect on links between your own teaching practice and theory. \r\n\r\nWith its high-quality teaching, this course is highly rated by Ofsted, who praised the 'inclusive, welcoming and open ethos and culture created by course leaders. Combined with the tailored and personalised support trainees receive, which enables them to successfully complete their training and confidently go on to gain employment.'
