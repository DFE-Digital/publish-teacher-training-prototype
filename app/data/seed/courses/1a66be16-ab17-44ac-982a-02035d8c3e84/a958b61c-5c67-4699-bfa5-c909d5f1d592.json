You will teach classes from across Key Stage 3 and Key Stage 4 across the year with some experience of Key Stage 5 teaching where available. Placement schools are carefully chosen to ensure they have strong support available for trainees that are on our programme.\r\n\r\nAt some point in the year, all trainees will complete a second school placement at another school (likely to be in the spring term). If your main placement school is not Reach Academy Feltham, then Reach Academy will be your second placement school.\r\n\r\nYou will have a subject mentor at your main placement school who will be your main day to day contact. You meet formally with them at least once a week to discuss your planning, receive feedback on your teaching and practice a key teaching technique. You will also have a professional mentor who is the key contact between the course leader and your placement school. They will oversee your placement and arrange the observations that will need to take place as part of assessing your progress.\r\n\r\nYou will also be supported by the course leader who is responsible for overseeing the programme.
