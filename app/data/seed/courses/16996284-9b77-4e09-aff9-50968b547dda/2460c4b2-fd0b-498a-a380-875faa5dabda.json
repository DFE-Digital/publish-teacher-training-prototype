The course is designed to help trainees demonstrate they have met the curriculum through planning, preparation and assessment of pupils. The programme is assessed through continual course work; there are no final exams.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Candidates take part in a selection and recruitment process designed to assess their suitability to train to teach. \r\n\r\nThe aim of the interview process is for candidates to demonstrate why they have chosen teaching as a career, demonstrate their subject knowledge and allow us to see their potential to work in in the classroom setting.\r\n\r\nIf successful, candidates will be made a conditional offer of a place on the TKAT SCITT programme, subject to all course requirements being met.\r\n\r\nCandidates will be invited to attend an interview. This will either be held virtually online or face-to-face.\r\n\r\nCandidates will be asked to plan a lesson which will be discussed during the interview and to prepare a short presenation based on the topic provided.\r\n\r\nCandidates will also be given a maths and written task to complete.\r\n\r\nFull details will be set out in the candidate's interview offer letter.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Applicants apply for their preferred school (A) placement where they will spend the majority of their training year. \r\n\r\nTrainees are required to complete a second (B) placement as part of training. \r\n\r\nThe second placement (B) will be for a minimum of four weeks in a contrasting setting. This enables us to ensure that we offer trainees a breadth of experience in their training year. Every effort is taken to place trainees in a school geographically convenient for them, without compromising their training needs.\r\n\r\nOur programme is full-time (term time only). Trainees spend four days a week in school and one day a week taking part in curriculum and professional studies at a partner school, the Atkins Centre (Sidcup, DA14 5AA) or via live online sessions. \r\n\r\nTrainees have the option of gaining a Distance Learning Postgraduate Certificate in Education (DLPGCE) through Leeds Beckett University. This is a distance learning programme which enhances the theoretical and research understanding of teaching and learning. \r\n\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"We are seeking  well-qualified graduates who have a passion for learning and a commitment to helping children be the best that they  can be.","otherRequirements":"* Disclosure Barring Service (DBS) Enhanced clearance;\r\n* Two satisfactory references;\r\n* Recommended as medically fit to teach.\r\n\r\n(TKAT SCITT meet the cost of the Enhanced DBS, however, if an overseas check is necessary, the additional cost will be met by \r\nthe trainee).\r\n\r\nTKAT is committed to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of our students, and expects all staff, trainees and volunteers to share this commitment.  \r\n\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:53:04.734Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-05T10:19:11.437Z","canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","cycle":"2024","salaryDetails":"Trainees on the salaried route will be paid on an unqualified teachers' pay scale 1 (minimum) at the discretion of each individual employing school, and as advertised.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) fee is met by the employing school.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the Distance Learning Postgraduate Certificate in Education (DLPGCE) with 60 Masters Credits (optional) is £2,000 and is met by the trainee.\r\n\r\n* Please note that salaried trainees are not eligible for student finance and therefore would need to self-fund their PGCE fee.\r\n"}
