You are expected to attend activities at your placement school just like other teachers at the school.\r\nOn Fridays, you attend the Bedford Campus of The University of Bedfordshire for taught sessions. You are a teacher Monday-Friday and are expected to work to the same professionalism throughout the week, regardless of location.\r\n\r\nWe give all our Trainee Teachers a quality placement. To do this we work with schools that are able to support you fully. The University offers teacher education through a partnership with a rich variety of different schools which provide Trainee Teacher placements across a geographically wide region.  \r\n\r\nWe aim to place you in a school inside our partnership area and within one hour journey from the Bedford Campus and your term time address. For those trainees living outside of our partnership area, we will endeavour to secure a school placement as near to your address as possible but still inside our partnership area. Should that not be possible, a placement will be allocated in the Bedford area. \r\n","personalQualities":null,"otherRequirements":"All suitable applicants will be interviewed and any offer of a place will be subject to receiving DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) and medical clearance.
