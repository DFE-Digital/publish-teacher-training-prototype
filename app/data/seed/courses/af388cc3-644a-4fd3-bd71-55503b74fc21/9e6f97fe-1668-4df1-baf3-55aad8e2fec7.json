During your course you will spend a minimum of 120 days across two different schools so that you can develop your teaching skills for Early Years and KS1 across the 3-7 age range. \r\nYou are based at your placement setting/school Monday - Thursday and act as any teacher would, albeit with a much lighter teaching timetable. The teacher’s day at school varies from school to school, but will include before and after school meetings, extra curricular events, open and parents' evening and other non-timetabled activities. You are expected to attend activities at your placement school just like other teachers at the school.\r\nOn Fridays, you attend the Bedford Campus of The University of Bedfordshire for taught sessions. You are a teacher Monday-Friday and are expected to work to the same professionalism throughout the week, regardless of location.\r\n\r\nWe give all our Trainee Teachers a quality placement. To do this we work with settings/schools that are able to support you fully. The University offers teacher education through a partnership with a rich variety of different schools which provide Trainee Teacher placements across a geographically wide region.  \r\n\r\nWe aim to place you in a school inside our partnership area and within one hour journey from the Bedford Campus and your term time address. For those trainees living outside of our partnership area, we will endeavour to secure a school placement as near to your address as possible but still inside our partnership area. Should that not be possible, a placement will be allocated in the Bedford area.\r\n","personalQualities":"We believe that everyone on our course has the potential to be an inspirational teacher so we are looking for people that demonstrate a commitment to meeting the needs of all children.
