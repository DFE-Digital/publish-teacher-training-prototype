The PGCE will be provided by Sheffield Hallam University. \r\nThe training programme will take place in a collaborative and supportive network of schools where you will gain experience in two contrasting schools and a variety of educational settings. This programme provides Masters’ Level accreditation (60 credits) which builds on the PGCE course. The National Modern Languages SCITT is in partnership with excellent schools from both the state and independent sector.\r\n\r\nYour training has been developed in close collaboration with Modern Languages experts from schools and universities and includes ‘day schools’ where we bring together all our trainees in Modern Languages for subject specialist training. The training will be delivered by our experienced classroom practitioners in collaboration with experienced ITT lecturers and our Director who has over twenty years’ experience as a languages teacher and subject leader. She is also a German national who trained to teach in England. You will have the opportunity to explore your own subject knowledge away from the classroom. There are two clear strands to the programme: academic study and classroom practice.\r\n\r\nWe are confident that you will receive an excellent start to your teaching career with The National Modern Languages SCITT and that you will be well placed to gain employment. By joining our SCITT which is associated with The Sheffield Teaching School Alliance, you will be able to access a clear path of Continued Professional Development (CPD) for excellent trainees who become Newly Qualified Teachers (NQT), Recently Qualified Teacher (RQTs) and future Middle and Senior Leaders. This is provided through our NQT training programme, Early Career Development Programme and links with the Department for Education Licensee provision for Middle and Senior Leaders. \r\n\r\nPlease be aware we are not a licenced sponsor of student visas and can therefore not support an application from outside the EEA.

The interview process will include representatives from the schools and will be a half-day to full day process. We are committed to providing a high quality experience for prospective trainees and have planned our interview days accordingly. The process may be longer than you have anticipated but the end result is that we have the best trainees training with the best schools.  We will contact all successful applicants at the end of the interview day. Similarly, we will provide feedback if we have not made an offer.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Each trainee will gain experience in two contrasting schools where you will be supported by a subject specific mentor in school. During the placements, there will be further training provided by the schools, University and the SCITT. Each school has a specialised programme of training put in place by a senior mentor which is designed to complement SCITT training and University academic input.  Some of this will take place across phases to provide experience in the relevant Key Stages.","personalQualities":"The potential to be an outstanding teacher with a passion for Modern Languages with sound subject knowledge.

We expect you to be aware of the professionalism required to teach and demonstrate your empathy and understanding when considering how a child learns and develops cognitively.","otherRequirements":"We would advise you to spend at least 5 days observing MFL lessons in a local secondary school to gain an insight into the teaching profession.  \r\n\r\nOur hubs offer taster days, please contact the Hub Lead School for further information about these events or please check our [NML SCITT website] for details (https://www.nationalmodernlanguages.com/) Your application should include all experience you have gained in an educational setting and details of any future experience you may have planned. \r\n\r\nAs you will be working with children you will be required to complete an enhanced DBS and Health check.\r\n","status":2,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:50:32.585Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2024"}
