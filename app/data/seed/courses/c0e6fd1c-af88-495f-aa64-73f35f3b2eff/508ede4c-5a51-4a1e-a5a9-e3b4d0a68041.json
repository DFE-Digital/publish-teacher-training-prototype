This programme will develop highly employable and reflective teachers capable of transforming lives, and inspiring and leading change in schools. \r\n\r\nThroughout the PGCE Primary programme you will be enhancing your subject and pedagogic knowledge in order to become a creative, dynamic and innovative teacher.  Overall there are five modules; three placement modules and two modules at Level 7. The two modules at Level 7 are Teaching, Learning and Assessment and Professional Studies. These are taught at our purpose built Waterside Campus by experienced and expert tutors and address the ITT Core Content Framework, National Curriculum coverage and national priorities in primary education. Over the year, there are blocks of centre-based Learning Events and three school-based training experiences (placements). There are two assignments, which are linked to the Level 7 modules.\r\n\r\nThe University of Northampton has an extensive School Experience Library which is an excellent resource offered specifically to trainee teachers to enhance their classroom practice.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Interviews are held at the University of Northampton and if candidates are successful they will be invited for a further interview at Upton Meadows Primary School.
