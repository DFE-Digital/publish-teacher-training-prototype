Secondary History, we will help you to transform your subject knowledge into teaching skills and educational theory into practice. You will then be qualified to deliver the National Curriculum and other related national strategies.  Completion leads to both a postgraduate qualification and recommendation for qualified teacher status (QTS).\r\n\r\nWorking in conjunction with the University of Manchester (Ofsted rated Outstanding 2019) you will attend university-based sessions that will enable you to reflect on teaching methods. These sessions will give you creative and innovative ideas to take into the classroom\r\n\r\nYou will spend approximately two-thirds of your time in schools and the rest will be University based. \r\n\r\nWe will support your development as a teacher by providing a quality teaching experience in our partner schools, where you will receive  guidance and support from experienced mentors. \r\n\r\nAs an alliance, we work collaboratively with a range of secondary schools in our local area, which enables us to tailor placements to the individual.  \r\n\r\nThroughout your training year, there will be a bespoke training program that will be delivered by highly effective practitioners from within our alliance. \r\n\r\nPeer lesson observations will enable you to participate actively in your own and your fellow students' development as teachers, with the expectation that you will begin to develop your own teaching style, set targets, take your own initiatives and evaluate your own work in planning, teaching and assessing.\r\n\r\nYou should anticipate that time in university-based learning combined with school-based placements will roughly equate to the time commitment of a full-time job, with additional time required in evenings and weekends for background reading, lesson planning and completing written assignments.\r\n\r\nYour school and University experiences are formally assessed. Both your mentors and tutors will help you to record your achievements and set targets.\r\n\r\nDuring each placement, you will be formally observed teaching and helpful and constructive feedback will be given, and at the end of each school experience, you will receive a report from your mentor. The report will comment on the following areas:\r\n\r\nteaching;\r\nplanning;\r\ndifferentiation and assessment;\r\nlearning environment;\r\nwider professional responsibilities.\r\nThese reports, together with your record of achievement and development, facilitate your progression as a teacher.\r\n\r\nThe written assignments will allow you to gain a maximum of 60 master's-level credits.  Guidance and support to complete these assignments will be available from your University tutors.","interviewProcess":"Following a successful application to UCAS, you will be invited to interview. \r\n\r\nThis process takes place during either a morning or an afternoon and we try to accommodate the needs of the applicant where possible. \r\n\r\nApplicants should expect to partake in a teaching activity, followed by a short presentation to a small interview panel and who will then pose interview style questions. \r\n\r\nThe interview panel will consist of a subject specialist, an alliance mentor and a member of the administrative staff.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Candidates will be placed in two schools throughout the year.  \r\n\r\nWe operate an A-B-A style training course.  This approach ensures students experience different schools, allowing them to return to their initial placement school following their second placement.  This style of placement facilitates self-reflection and pedagogical development.\r\n\r\nPlacement schools are selected based upon the needs of the trainees, the strengths of the differing departments across schools.
