Arden Alliance has been training teachers via the school direct route for many years and our trainees always extol the virtues of working closely with their fellow subject teachers; the excellent personalised training and, probably most of all, being completely submerged within their subject department and feeling like one of the team.\r\n","interviewProcess":"You will be asked to attend the school in which you wish to train for interview/assessment.     The process takes a couple of hours and includes a 40 minute literacy/numeracy task; 20-25 minute \"micro-lesson\" and a formal interview.   The purpose of the micro-lesson is to see how you interact and communicate with students.   The formal interview will be with a member of the Teaching School team and the Head of Department for the subject you are interested in teaching.   \r\nIf you are successful, a decision to recommend you for offer will be made within 24 hours and you should expect to hear from The University of Warwick within 1 week of your interview.\r\n\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Trainees spend 4 days a week in the training school of their choice, and 1 day at The University of Warwick - (https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/cte/).  \r\nDuring the course of your training, you will spend 1 week in a primary school setting and a half-term (usually in the Spring Term) in an alternative (complementary) secondary school setting.   \r\nWe have 6 secondary schools and 4 primary schools within our Alliance and your placement will be in one of our own partner schools.
