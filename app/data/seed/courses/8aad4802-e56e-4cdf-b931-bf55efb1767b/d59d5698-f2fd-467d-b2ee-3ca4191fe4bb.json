Arden Alliance has been training teachers via the school direct route for many years and our trainees always extol the virtues of working closely with their fellow subject teachers; the excellent personalised training and, probably most of all, being completely submerged within their subject department and feeling like one of the team.\r\nFor this course, which you will be based in the PE Department, you must also be able to teach history (at KS3 level) therefore, history A-Level Grade A-C is required.  \r\n","interviewProcess":"You will be asked to attend the school in which you wish to train for interview/assessment.     The process takes a couple of hours and includes a 40 minute literacy/numeracy task; 20-25 minute \"micro-lesson\" and a formal interview.   The purpose of the micro-lesson is to see how you interact and communicate with students.   The formal interview will be with a member of the Teaching School team and the Head of Department for the subject you are interested in teaching.   \r\nIf you are successful, a decision to recommend you for offer will be made within 24 hours and you should expect to hear from The University of Warwick within 1 week of your interview.\r\n\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Trainees spend 4 days a week in the training school of their choice, and 1 day at The University of Warwick - (https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/cte/).  \r\nDuring the course of your training, you will spend 1 week in a primary school setting and a half-term (usually in the Spring Term) in an alternative (complementary) secondary school setting.   \r\nWe have 6 secondary schools and 4 primary schools within our Alliance and your placement will be in one of our own partner schools.
