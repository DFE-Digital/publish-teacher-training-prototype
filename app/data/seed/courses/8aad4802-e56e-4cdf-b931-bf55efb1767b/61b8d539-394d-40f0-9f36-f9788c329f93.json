Whilst all our primary partners offer the same quality training which is rigorously overseen by our own Quality Assurance Lead, applicants often choose a training location based on ease of travel, etc. \r\n\r\nTo learn more about each school, we recommend that you view the respective website of the school you wish to teach in.   To access this information, you can go through our Alliance website: (https://sites.google.com/arden.solihull.sch.uk/ats/itt-school-direct/about/partner-schools)   \r\n\r\nIf you have any specific questions, please do not hesitate to get in touch via email on [traintoteach@arden.solihull.sch.uk]\r\n","interviewProcess":"You will be asked to attend the school in which you plan to train for interview/assessment.     The process takes a couple of hours and includes a 40 minute literacy/numeracy task; 20-25 minute \"micro-lesson\" and formal interview.   The purpose of the micro-lesson is to see how you interact with students.   The formal interview will be with a member of the Teaching School team and a member of the senior leadership team.\r\nIf you are successful, a decision to recommend you for offer will be made within 24 hours and you should expect to hear from The University of Warwick within 1 week of your interview. \r\n\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Trainees spend 4 days a week in school and 1 day at The University of Warwick.  You will train alongside a class teacher who will be your mentor, offering one-to-one bespoke training developed specifically to work with your own strengths and weaknesses.\r\nYou will spend 1 whole term (spring term) in an alternative (complementary) primary school setting, training at a different key stage level to increase your knowledge and experience.  \r\nWe have 4 primary schools within our Alliance and your complementary placement will be in one of our own partner schools.
