You will be supported throughout by expert colleagues including our trained school mentors, subject specialists and link tutors. Former trainees describe our team as offering \"amazing support and focus on well-being.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a school-led programme, accredited by an Ofsted outstanding provider of Primary Initial Teacher Education, affording you the opportunity to link theory with practice simultaneously to drive your progress. Whilst on placement, 1-2 days a week you will undertake REAch Teach or university training.\r\n\r\nOur programme is structured via 12 face-to-face training days in local partner schools and 12 online training sessions. We hold our sessions in exemplary schools where you observe and de-construct a range of outstanding teaching practice alongside fellow trainees. Our online training brings together REAch Teach trainees across our national network to enhance collaboration and community.\r\n\r\nFacilitators are outstanding teachers and leaders who provide practical tools and strategies you can apply in the classroom.  With an additional 14 hours of Masters level teaching from The University of Derby, our curriculum provides firm pedagogical foundations which go beyond the mechanics of teaching so you become a confident teacher with a clear professional identity. \r\n\r\nPast trainees have described our training sessions as \"incredibly useful because they were delivered by experienced professionals who still work as teachers or in their fields of expertise.\"\r\n\r\nCore modules focus on pedagogy and its practical implications and include:\r\n* Professional Practice and Pedagogy \r\n* Theories of Learning and Teaching: The Pupil as Learner\r\n* Developing Teacher Enquiry: Research Informed Practice \r\n\r\nAll assessments relate to your school placements. You will complete three assessed teaching placements: two in your main school and one in a second school. You will also complete one essay, one critical presentation and one presentation on an area of curriculum interest. Alongside weekly developmental feedback, there will also be 6 assessed teaching observations during the year. \r\n\r\nSuccessful completion leads to the award of Postgraduate Certificate of Education (PGCE) which includes recommendation for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).  You will also have the opportunity to gain 60 Masters level credits. For further information: https://www.derby.ac.uk/postgraduate/teacher-training-courses/pgce-primary-school-direct/ \r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"We aim for our interview process to be as relaxing as possible so that you can feel comfortable to show us your true potential. \r\n\r\nShortlisted applicants will complete an online Stage 1 interview where you will be asked to deliver a presentation, respond to a range of scenario based questions and complete maths and English tasks. This takes around 1 hour to complete and the panel will consist of a local ITT Lead and either our Head of Early Career Development or a partner school representative. \r\n\r\nIf you are successful at Stage 1, you will complete a Stage 2 assessment in one of our partner schools. This will involve you completing a 20 minute teaching a activity with a small group of children. This gives us an opportunity to see how you interact with and respond to pupils. We try where possible at this stage to give you the opportunity to meet leaders from your preferred partner school. \r\n\r\nOur selection process is designed to assess how well you demonstrate the following competencies which we think are essential in an effective trainee, and ultimately in successful teachers:\r\n* Person-centred communication \r\n* Self-management \r\n* Care and compassion \r\n* Works well with others\r\n* Professional practitioner\r\n* Copes with demands\r\n* Engages with learning\r\n* Adaptable\r\n\r\nIn addition to this all trainees must demonstrate:\r\n*  High quality written English \r\n*  A suitable academic profile \r\n*  A clear education and employment record\r\n*  Favourable and recent references\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"As part of the course, you will undertake three assessed teaching placements in good or outstanding schools to broaden your experience. You will be supported throughout by highly trained school mentors on each school placement, as well as the same Link tutor and University Tutors throughout. We invest heavily in our mentor training to ensure you receive the best support throughout the programme. \r\n\r\nWe work with a large network of around 65 partnership of schools, grouped in local clusters. A benefit of training with us is that you can indicate a preference to train in a particular school as you main placement school. This means you have the opportunity to train locally in schools whose ethos and values align with yours. We are fortunate to have a wide range of good and outstanding school partners so each year, this means we can select the locations of our training based on proximity to our trainee cohort. Alongside our online learning, this helps to reduce unnecessary travel. \r\n\r\nOur network of primary schools is diverse yet they share the values of integrity, inclusion and success for all children, regardless of their background. Our partners include rural, multi-cultural and inner city schools;  most schools are part of the REAch2 Academy Trust, the largest primary only academy trust in the country yet we are also proud of our links with a range of other schools in local communities. Starting your teaching career with REAch2 brings with it unrivalled training and development and excellent career progression.
