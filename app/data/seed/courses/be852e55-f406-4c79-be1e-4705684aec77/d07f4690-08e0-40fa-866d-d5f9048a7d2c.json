","aboutCourse":"At Nottinghamshire Torch SCITT we pride ourselves on ensuring all our trainee teachers have an exceptional training experience.\r\n\r\nThe majority of your time will be spent in your placement schools to gain qualified teacher status developing your practice working alongside school-based mentors.\r\n\r\n* The course starts with an intensive 2 week induction programme to the teaching and learning process, including discussion and development of basic elements of teaching, introduction to planning and curriculum, behaviour management and safeguarding, etc.  You will experience a range of school settings, meet over 30 different educational experts and feel fully confident before you start. This will enable deeper, more detailed coverage of the professional standards to be done later during the training year. The aim is to give you a thorough grounding prior to starting school placements. \r\n* Fridays will be spent on core and subject specific training as well as 10 days across the year at the University of Nottingham where you will gain your PGCE and Masters credits.\r\n* We have a dedicated team of Subject Specific Mentors across our alliance who will ensure you are supported in your school and will quality assure the training you are undertaking.\r\n* Timetables will be developed to progress practice, by having an escalation of the number of lessons taught, and/or developing stages in practice, from supporting the class teacher, to team teaching with the class teacher, to taking elements of a lesson, to taking full lessons.\r\n* You will have two main placement schools and through training and extended placements visit over 10 schools within our partnership.\r\n* We offer you an international experience which is a unique feature of the programme enabling you to more deeply appreciate the need to secure high standards and outcomes for students, to enable them to compete in a global world.  We believe this experience can assist you in deepening your pedagogical thinking and help you to develop into reflective practitioners.\r\n* You will experience a range of special educational needs (both during mainstream placements and via a special school visit), strategies for supporting students with such needs plus real experiences of differentiation and personalised learning which will give you an excellent grounding for teaching SEN/D students within mainstream education.\r\n* Throughout the course you will receive exceptional levels of support and care from the SCITT core team, mentors and subject specialists to ensure you succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Torch SCITT Website](http://teachnottinghamshire.co.uk/)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"We will screen your application and decide whether to offer you an interview.
