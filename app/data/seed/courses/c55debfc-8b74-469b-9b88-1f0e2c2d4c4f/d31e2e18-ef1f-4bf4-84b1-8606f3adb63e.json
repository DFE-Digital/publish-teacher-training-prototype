Trainees on the CTK SD route will have an opportunity to take a teaching placement in a faith school.    \r\n\r\nTrainees undertaking this programme will opt to specialise in either Early Primary (3-7 years) or Primary (5-11 years). Specialising in an age range leads to accelerated progress and learning for trainees.  It is important to note that specialising in one age range does not preclude you from teaching across the age ranges of primary school.  \r\n\r\nAll trainees benefit from attending all the [Leicester and Leicestershire SCITT](https://leics-scitt.co.uk/why-choose-scitt/) Early Primary or Primary training sessions alongside trainees on other SCITT and School Direct programmes. \r\n\r\nTraining sessions take place in bespoke training rooms within schools.   Sessions are dynamic and engaging. Each of the 30-35 trainees quickly become known as unique individuals so SCITT trainers and management can mould training and select placements to fit each individual’s needs, working exactly as skilled teachers do with their pupils.  This is a key strength of our programme, making the training personalised so that trainees are challenged and supported at every step in becoming the best teacher they can be.    \r\n\r\nThe SCITT trainers are all leading experts in their fields, charismatic and passionate about making a difference in children’s lives. They include excellent practitioners from partner schools and consultants who will ensure trainees will swiftly establish an understanding of learning and developmental progression and how these are fundamental in teaching in foundation stage / KS1 or KS1/KS2.\r\n\r\nCentral training includes days spent working with exceptional teachers and their pupils, in exceptional partnership schools, so all trainees are exposed to best practice in teaching creatively and effectively. We want future pupils to love learning and our future teachers to love teaching!   \r\n\r\nAn integral part of the courses is a full University of Leicester PGCE, with Masters Level credits.  Trainees complete the equivalent of two 5000 word assignments within this internationally recognised PGCE award,   receiving additional training at the University and are recognised as students of the University. This includes access to the library, sports and learning support facilities. \r\n\r\nClick [HERE](https://leics-scitt.co.uk/our-courses/) for more information about the course design and timetables.\r\n","interviewProcess":"The SCITT and School Direct partner alliances, will use a two stage interview process for candidates called to interview, normally held on two separate days. It may be possible to hold both interviews on the same day for candidates who need to travel further or candidates who will find attending interview for two half days particularly difficult.  \r\n\r\nAs part of our selection process all candidates will be asked to complete written audits in English and mathematics.  The written audits assess whether each candidate’s personal subject knowledge in English and mathematics is sufficient to form a secure base to underpin high quality teaching of these subjects in the primary school. \r\n\r\n [Audit Information and Preparation Advice](https://leics-scitt.co.uk/entry-requirements/our-interview-process/)\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The SCITT partnership knows trainees can only reach their potential if given exceptional support in placements. Teaching is about relationships; and the relationship between a trainee and their class teacher on placement is vitally important.  The trust and loyalty of headteachers and teachers in our partner schools, built up over the last 14 years, is a key strength of our training. The SCITT is proud that ALL of the top four of Leicestershire’s primary schools [(The Real Schools Guide 2019)](https://leics-scitt.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/TOP-ten-schools-2019.pdf) are our partners, offering placements and employing many SCITT trained teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe consistently high quality of support on 3 different school placements, from dedicated and enthusiastic teachers, underpins our success, making us one of the very top teacher training providers in the country [(The Good Teacher Training Guides)](https://www.buckingham.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/GTTG17fin.pdf).  This maximises opportunities for each trainee to learn from best practice in different settings, including one guaranteed placement in a faith school.  This allow trainees to experience the Christian ethos within a faith school, participating in collective worship, daily prayer and a sharing of faith.  Our trainees complete training confident across the key stages and fully prepared to work in a wide variety of schools, ready to serve diverse pupil populations. \r\n\r\n\r\nPlacements are carefully matched to trainee’s development needs and SCITT management also take into account the fact that trainees may be using public transport to reach placement schools.  Trainees with children are always thought about carefully so as to best support them as they juggle teaching demands with their own childcare arrangements. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe autumn placement starts with an introduction week, followed by a 7 week block.  Spring and Summer terms have the same introduction week, followed by a 6 and 9 week block respectively.  We have over 80 partner primary schools across the city and county which offers trainees a wide range of schools in which to gain experience.   \r\n\r\n\r\nOfsted (2016) reported that “Placement schools are very carefully allocated to provide trainees with teaching experiences across the whole 5-11 age range in a variety of settings. This is an outstanding feature of the training.”\r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for talented, creative individuals, with a passion for teaching across a wide range of subjects within the primary curriculum. Good communication skills are at the heart of effective teaching and all applicants are expected to demonstrate excellent interpersonal and communication skills. \r\n\r\nTeachers in schools know that teaching demands stamina and perseverance. We look for applicants with the resilience and determination required to cope with the demands of teaching. \r\n\r\nWe aim to recruit a range of good role models representative of the local population, particularly from minority ethnic communities and men. We also encourage LSAs and career changers.\r\n","otherRequirements":"Having your own faith is not an essential requirement of this course.  \r\n\r\nA commitment to undertake teacher training is a major step. As such, it is important applicants understand the pressures and rewards of working in a British primary school in the twenty first century. Applicants are strongly encouraged to have a minimum of one week’s relevant and recent experience in a primary school. We feel this is advantageous to demonstrate your understanding of teaching and learning in your interview.   \r\n\r\n\r\nApplicants will need to pass health and DBS police checks and have the physical and mental fitness to teach. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:14.699Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-30T08:58:28.673Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2024"}
