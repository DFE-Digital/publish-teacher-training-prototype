It trains you to teach children in the five-to-11 age range. \r\n\r\nAs a trainee you will learn how to teach the entire primary curriculum as well as choosing a particular route. The English as an Additional Language route is for graduates who are particularly interested in how pupils whose first language is not English are included and supported in schools.\r\n\r\nEast London offers multicultural, multilingual and vibrant schools in which to learn, but your training at UEL will qualify you to teach anywhere in England or Wales.\r\n\r\nOur PGCE team is made up of experienced practitioners who have worked in a range of primary and early years settings across London as classroom teachers, curriculum co-ordinators, advisory teachers and school leaders.\r\n\r\nAt UEL you will be part of a diverse community of students. We want to bring to east London a teacher workforce that reflects the local community.","interviewProcess":"The entire interview process lasts about three hours.

You will be supported in these schools by a school based mentor as well as your UEL tutor.
