The Early Years route is designed for graduates who are interested in teaching children aged three to seven, but this will not restrict you to working with this age group.\r\n\r\nEast London offers multicultural, multilingual and vibrant schools in which to learn, but your training at UEL will qualify you to teach anywhere in England or Wales.\r\n\r\nUEL’s PGCE team is made up of experienced practitioners who have worked in a range of primary and Early Years settings across London as classroom teachers, curriculum co-ordinators, advisory teachers and school leaders.","interviewProcess":"The entire interview process lasts about three hours.
