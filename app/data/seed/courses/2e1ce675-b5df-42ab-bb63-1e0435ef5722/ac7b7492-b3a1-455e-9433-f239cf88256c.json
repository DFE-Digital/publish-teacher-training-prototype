The way computing is taught in schools has changed. Children in schools now learn about programming and other computer science based topics from the age of five. Applicants will be expected to have a clear understanding of computer science or be prepared to undertake a subject knowledge enhancement course in the field.\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"You will be interviewed at UEL by the Computing ITT course tutor, and where possible, a practising teacher from one of our partner schools. The interview will involve two tests - one that focuses on your literacy expertise and one that considers you subject knowledge.

You are also asked to prepare a lesson plan for Year 7 pupils, which you will present during the interview.
