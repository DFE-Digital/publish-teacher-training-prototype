Where possible, we also give you the chance to gain experience in the 11 to 18 age range.\r\n\r\nIt is of the utmost importance that all young people get the chance to learn at least one language to a high standard.\r\n\r\nThat’s why schools will always need highly-skilled language teachers to help pupils develop valuable, lifelong skills – and why trainee language teachers can benefit from the highest range of training bursaries.\r\n\r\nThe three most commonly taught languages in east London schools are French, German and Spanish, followed by Italian, Russian, Mandarin, Japanese, Urdu and Bengali. \r\n\r\nYour teacher training will help you discover how to open young people’s eyes and ears up to the beauty of the language by exploring its uses in business, everyday life and culture.\r\n","interviewProcess":"You will be interviewed at UEL by the ML ITT course tutor, and where possible, a practising teacher from one of our partner schools.

You are also asked to prepare a lesson plan for Year 7 pupils, which you will present during the interview.
