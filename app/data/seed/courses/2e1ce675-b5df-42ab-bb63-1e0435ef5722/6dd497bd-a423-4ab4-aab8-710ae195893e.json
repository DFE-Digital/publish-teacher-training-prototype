It trains you to teach the five to 11 age range. \r\n\r\nAs a trainee you will learn how to teach the entire primary curriculum as well as choosing a particular route. This SEN: Special Schools route is designed to give you the skills and confidence to meet the needs of pupils in special schools.\r\n\r\nEast London offers multicultural, multilingual and vibrant schools in which to learn, but your training at UEL will qualify you to teach anywhere in England or Wales.\r\n\r\nOur PGCE team is made up of experienced practitioners who have worked in a range of primary and Early Years settings across London as classroom teachers, curriculum co-ordinators, advisory teachers and school leaders.\r\n\r\nAt UEL you will be part of a diverse community of students. We want to bring to east London a teacher workforce that reflects the local community and, in 2013-14, 24 per cent of our Primary PGCE trainees were men.","interviewProcess":"The entire interview process lasts about three hours. During the interview you will be asked to talk about a current educational issue.  Please ensure you have done some research into current educational issues in advance of the interview.

We do not wish to disadvantage our trainees by asking them to travel a long distance to their placement schools.

You will be supported in these schools by a school based mentor as well as your UEL tutor.
