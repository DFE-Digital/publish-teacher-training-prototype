The Primary PGCE with The Arts route gives you additional expertise in supporting the teaching and learning of music and art. It is not essential that you consider yourself to be an expert musician or artist, or to have any particular qualifications (though these would be advantageous), but you should feel strongly about the important role of the arts in the education of young people. You will develop the arts skills and knowledge that you have and develop a range of activities and strategies for bringing the arts ‘alive’ in your practice. UEL is blessed with fantastic resources for training in music and art education and it will be possible for you to develop your own ability as well as the pedagogies you will need to teach music effectively in schools.\r\n\r\nEast London offers multicultural, multilingual and particularly vibrant schools in which to train, but your training at UEL will qualify you to teach anywhere in England or Wales.\r\n\r\nUEL’s PGCE team is made up of experienced primary practitioners who have worked in a range of primary and Early Years settings across London as classroom teachers, curriculum co-ordinators, advisory teachers and school leaders.","interviewProcess":"The entire interview process lasts about three hours. During the interview you will be asked to talk about a current educational issue.  Please ensure you have done some research into current educational issues in advance of the interview.  You could, for example, read recent editions of the Times Educational Supplement. \r\n\r\nOur aim is to find out as much as we can about your attributes, skills, knowledge and understanding in order to shape training opportunities for you, should you be offered a place on the programme. \r\n\r\nYour responses to these tasks and activities will be considered alongside all the other evidence to assess your suitability for the Primary PGCE programme.\r\n\r\nDuring the individual interview you will be given the chance to talk with a tutor about the programme and any other issues that are relevant.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We work within a very large partnership of schools across London and also Essex, Hertfordshire, Kent and Surrey. We do not wish to disadvantage our trainees by asking them to travel a long distance to their placement schools. Generally, we look at one hour door to door as being the maximum travel time expected.  You will experience three, eight week placements in three complementary schools. You will be supported in these schools by a school based mentor as well as your UEL tutor","personalQualities":"*Good interpersonal skills with young people and/or adults;\r\n\r\n*Evidence of ability to respond to a challenge and overcome setbacks;\r\n\r\n*Resilience and commitment;\r\n\r\n*Evidence of knowledge of wider education issues and the ability to express and justify opinions and to consider those of others.","otherRequirements":null,"status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:53.030Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-23T09:19:30.524Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes"}
