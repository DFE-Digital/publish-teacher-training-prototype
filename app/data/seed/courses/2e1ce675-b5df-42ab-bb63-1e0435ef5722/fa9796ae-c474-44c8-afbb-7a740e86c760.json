The interview will involve two tests - one that focuses on your literacy expertise and one that considers you subject knowledge. These tests are not pass/ fail in design, but simply enable us to ascertain the best ways of supporting these areas as you hopefully progress onto the programme. You are also asked to prepare a lesson plan for Year 7 pupils, which you will present during the interview. ","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We work within a very large partnership of schools across London and also Essex, Hertfordshire, Kent and Surrey.

You will be teaching all year groups in the 11-16 age range but we do provide 16-18 experience as well in many school placements.
