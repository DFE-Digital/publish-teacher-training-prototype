In the last research assessment exercise, the department was rated second in the UK (REF, 2014). You will have the opportunity to work with experienced tutors who are actively engaged in research in their subject and in pedagogy more widely. 94% of 2018 graduates who sought teaching posts were employed within 6 months of qualifying. In our 2020 student survey, 98% of trainees rated their training as good, very good or excellent.\r\n\r\nThis course aims to prepare students to:\r\n* become effective secondary school teachers\r\n* become knowledgeable subject specialists who can progress to take on responsibilities in curriculum development\r\n* become good classroom managers\r\n* become successful form tutors and collaborative colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe course encourages learning through critical reflection, making connections between the theory and practice of teaching, and continuing to self-evaluate and improve throughout a teaching career.\r\n\r\nWe work to enable students to teach pupils to think, and to interpret pupils' understanding, building their subsequent teaching on this.\r\n\r\nProgramme description\r\n\r\nThe special features of the PGCE science programmes at King’s are:\r\n\r\n* Separate groups for each of the four science specialisms: Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Physics with Mathematics. These focus on how to teach your specialist subject to the age range 11-18.\r\n* Sessions designed to help you teach science topics which are outside your science subject specialism. These are designed to help you contribute to science programmes at Key Stage 3 and 4.\r\n* 'Science Pedagogy' sessions where you work in mixed groups of science students on topics like scientific enquiry, formative assessment, use of discussion in science lessons and cognitive acceleration through science education. These classes are often taught by people who are at the forefront of research about innovative teaching strategies. The Science Education research group at King's is the largest in the UK and has a strong national and international reputation. This allows us to feed new ideas into the PGCE programme and creates a dynamic and forward-looking course. \r\n*The course is set in the context of a friendly department with a strong commitment to our students.\r\n\r\n[KCL Biology Course Information](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught-courses/pgce-biology.aspx)\r\n","interviewProcess":"The King’s process includes an interview, a group task and a short piece of writing.\r\n\r\nIn the interview and group task we will be looking for:\r\n\r\n* evidence that you have a commitment to working with young people;\r\n* ability to explain clearly and to think on your feet;\r\n* evidence of good interpersonal skills;\r\n* knowledge of school level science in each of biology, chemistry and physics;\r\n* familiarity with the realities of teaching science in secondary schools;\r\n*  awareness of current educational issues;\r\n*  commitment to equal opportunities;\r\n* ability to work well in a group dynamic.\r\n\r\nWriting\r\nIn your writing we will be looking for:\r\n* ability to express yourself clearly;\r\n*  accurate grammar and spelling.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"School Direct trainees start at their chosen school during the first week of the autumn term. Term dates will be confirmed upon acceptance of an offer.\r\n\r\nThe university course starts in the second week of September and is full-time until late June. Sessions are usually from 9:30 to 4:30 but much of the time is spent in schools and you are usually expected to be in school by 8:00 or 8:30. The course is very intensive and most students find that they are not able to do part-time work during this time.\r\n\r\nAround half of the schools within the Catholic Schools' Partnership offer training placements. Those who are able to support the main placement are listed for each respective course. \r\n\r\nCandidates usually apply to schools that are located close to where they live and we are happy to arrange tours and an observation day in your preferred school prior to application. \r\n\r\nWhen applying please select your preferred school.

Where possible, we will try to accommodate your request and placements are arranged with a maximum commuting distance of 1 hour 15 minutes based upon the address provided. Travel time is usually significantly less than this.\r\n\r\nWe are able to offer contrasting placements in single-sex or mixed schools and in schools with sixth forms where your main placement school is 11-16.
