In the last research assessment exercise, the department was rated second in the UK (REF, 2014). You will have the opportunity to work with experienced tutors who are actively engaged in research in their subject and in pedagogy more widely. 94% of 2018 graduates who sought teaching posts were employed within 6 months of qualifying. In our 2019 student survey, 92% of trainees rated the quality of their training as very good or good.\r\n\r\nThis course aims to prepare students to:\r\n* become effective secondary school teachers\r\n* become knowledgeable subject specialists who can progress to take on responsibilities in curriculum development\r\n* become good classroom managers\r\n* become successful form tutors and collaborative colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe course encourages learning through critical reflection, making connections between the theory and practice of teaching, and continuing to self-evaluate and improve throughout a teaching career.\r\nWe work to enable students to teach pupils to think, and to interpret pupils' understanding, building their subsequent teaching on this.\r\n\r\nProgramme description\r\nWe adopt a variety of teaching and learning strategies during the year. Our aim is to use the sessions not only to give practical and theoretical ideas on the teaching of English but to model ways in which you might teach English in the classroom.\r\n\r\nSessions include:\r\n* opportunities to discuss and debate in small groups\r\n* interactive whole class teaching\r\n* trialling materials for use in schools\r\n* using drama, media and technology resources.\r\n* lectures\r\n* opportunities for students to develop their presentation skills.\r\n\r\nWe also make full use of the university's unique location on the river Thames by providing opportunities throughout the year to visit places like the Globe, Tate Modern and the Poetry Library.\r\n\r\n[Course Information](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught-courses/pgce-english.aspx)\r\n","interviewProcess":"The King’s process includes:\r\na group discussion, a written task and an individual interview.\r\n\r\nWriting\r\nIn your writing we will be looking for:\r\n*  ability to express yourself clearly;\r\n*  accurate grammar and spelling.\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"All School Direct trainees start at their chosen school during the first week of the autumn term before attending university sessions the following week. School term dates will be confirmed once you have accepted an offer.\r\n\r\nAround half of the schools within the Catholic Schools’ Partnership offer training placements. Those who are able to support the main placement are listed for each respective course.\r\n\r\nCandidates tend to apply to schools that are located close to where they live and we are happy to arrange tours and an observation day in your preferred school prior to application. \r\n\r\nAt the point of application please select your first choice of school.  Once your application has passed our vetting process you will be invited to interview at KCL and if successful at this stage this will be followed by an interview at the school.\r\n\r\nWe offer an ABA placement route with King's College London. This involves one long placement with a 6-week placement at another school within the CSP in the spring term before you return to your original school for the remainder of the course. \r\n\r\nAt the start of the academic year we will contact all registered trainees to confirm the area where you are living and to ask about the type of school that you would like to be placed in for your second placement. Where possible, we will try to accommodate your request and placements are arranged with a maximum commuting distance of 1 hour 15 minutes based upon the address provided. Travel time is usually significantly less than this.\r\n\r\nWe are able to offer contrasting placements in single-sex or mixed schools and in schools with sixth forms where your main placement school is 11-16.  Where you have completed a placement in a single-sex school your second placement will be in a mixed school or a school with students of the opposite sex.\r\n\r\nShould you have any questions relating to the placement structure, please do not hesitate to email c.barclay@catholicschoolspartnership.org.uk for more information.\r\n","personalQualities":"* Ability to engage interest and communicate your own enthusiasm for English\r\n* Commitment to working with young people\r\n* Ability to explain ideas clearly and to think on your feet\r\n* Evidence of good interpersonal skills\r\n* Awareness of current educational issues\r\n\r\nPotential for Teaching \r\nPrevious experience of teaching or voluntary work in a school is desirable.\r\nSpend at least one day observing your subject being taught in a  secondary school and reference this in your application.\r\n\r\nDemonstrate an awareness of what good teaching entails (or why some teaching you experienced was bad) and indicate a desire to teach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"You should provide:\r\n* a reference which identifies your academic strengths and personal qualities required for teaching\r\n* a reference with no reservations about suitability e.g. relating to academic achievement, effort, health, commitment, consistency, group working skills, communication skills\r\n\r\nPolice Clearance\r\nCandidates offered a place will be asked to complete an enhanced check with the DBS to ensure they do not have a criminal background which might prevent them from working as a teacher.
