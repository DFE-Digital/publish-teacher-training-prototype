Ideally you will have a good degree in mathematics. However, there is a significant difference between school mathematics and the wide variety of topics and areas which are studied in mathematics degrees; therefore degrees with a significant mathematical element are also acceptable for mathematics teaching – these include, for example, physics, some psychology courses and some economics courses. As a guide we would normally expect 50% of the degree to be in mathematics beyond A-level. For that reason degrees in for example accountancy and business studies frequently do not cover enough mathematics to equip someone to teach at A‐level.\n\nKnowledge and understanding of the subject you intend to teach. Applicants must have detailed knowledge and understanding of the subject you intend to teach, which is up to full A-level Mathematics. A high grade in at least single subject A‐level mathematics (or equivalent) is essential, since the course is for teaching ages 11‐18 and you will need to teach this level. If your degree subject does not contain any mathematics we would expect you to have high grades in A level mathematics and A level further mathematics","english":"3","maths":"1","acceptPendingGcse":"yes","acceptGcseEquivalency":"yes","acceptEnglishGcseEquivalency":"yes","acceptMathsGcseEquivalency":"no","additionalGcseEquivalencies":"[A Star Equivalency](https://astarequivalency.co.uk/), or [Birmingham City University](https://www.bcu.ac.uk/education-and-social-work/initial-teacher-training/gcse-equivalency-test/gcse-equivalency-tests-non-bcu-applicants).

In the last research assessment exercise, the department was rated second in the UK (REF, 2014). You will have the opportunity to work with experienced tutors who are actively engaged in research in their subject and in pedagogy more widely. 94% of 2018 graduates who sought teaching posts were employed within 6 months of qualifying. In our 2020 student survey, 98% of trainees rated their training as good, very good or excellent.\r\n\r\nThis course aims to prepare students to:\r\n* become effective secondary school teachers\r\n* become knowledgeable subject specialists who can progress to take on responsibilities in curriculum development\r\n* become good classroom managers\r\n* become successful form tutors and collaborative colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe course encourages learning through critical reflection, making connections between the theory and practice of teaching, and continuing to self-evaluate and improve throughout a teaching career.\r\n\r\nWe work to enable students to teach pupils to think, and to interpret pupils' understanding, building their subsequent teaching on this.\r\n\r\nProgramme description\r\nThe principle of the mathematics course at King’s is a view of teaching based on the process of planning ‐ teaching ‐ reflection. The process looks at relevant research, the principles of the mathematical topic which is being taught and links with other areas of the mathematical curriculum. In general mathematics sessions are workshops where we consider how to build upon pupils’ prior knowledge and address any misconceptions they might have. A sequence of lessons can then be planned to enable successful learning and teaching. Suitable responses from pupils are identified to assess their progress and understanding, and the effectiveness of the teaching approach used. Additional areas covered in the mathematics programme include:\r\n\r\n*\tGrowth mindset\r\n*\tMotivation and engagement\r\n*\tMathematical modelling\r\n*\tProblem solving\r\n*\tReasoning and proof\r\n*\tAssessment methods\r\n*\tResources beyond textbooks\r\n*\tGovernment initiatives \r\n\r\nThis is a full-time course consisting of four required modules and two placements in secondary schools within the Catholic Schools' Partnership. You will complete the course within ten months, studying September to June. 120 credits are required for the qualification. Two assessed pieces of coursework give you 60 Master’s-level credits (a third of an MA) which can be put towards to a Master’s degree later in your teaching career.\r\n","interviewProcess":"The King’s process includes an interview, short written task and a mathematics task.\r\n\r\nBefore a place is offered all applicants will be invited for an interview. The interview is looking to see whether you have a reasonable understanding of mathematics for teaching pupils aged 11‐18 years, to see if you can communicate with an audience, to see that you have prepared yourself for taking a career move towards teaching and to look at your commitment to teaching. You will complete a written task and a mathematics task and an individual interview. The individual interview will explore your views about teaching in general and more specifically teaching some aspects of the secondary mathematics curriculum. \r\n\r\nDuring the individual interview and the mathematics task, we will be looking for:\r\n\r\n* An ability to explain concepts at a school level\r\n* How you engage with the audience\r\n* Understanding of the subject you wish to teach\r\n* Confidence\r\n\r\nIn your written task we will be looking for:\r\n* An ability to express yourself clearly\r\n* A considered view of the profession you wish to enter\r\n* Accurate grammar and spelling\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"School Direct trainees start at their chosen school during the first week of the autumn term. Term dates will be confirmed upon acceptance of an offer.\r\n\r\nThe university course starts in the second week of September and is full-time until late June. Sessions are usually from 9:30 to 4:30 but much of the time is spent in schools and you are usually expected to be in school by 8:00 or 8:30. The course is very intensive and most students find that they are not able to do part-time work during this time.\r\n\r\nAround half of the schools within the Catholic Schools’ Partnership offer training placements. Those who are able to support the main placement are listed for each respective course.\r\n\r\nCandidates usually apply to schools that are located close to where they live and we are happy to arrange tours and an observation day in your preferred school prior to application. \r\n\r\nWhen applying please select your preferred school.  Once your application passes our vetting process you will be invited to interview at KCL followed by an interview at the school.\r\n\r\nWe offer an ABA placement route, this includes a 6-week placement at another school within the CSP in the spring term before you return to your original school for the remainder of the course. \r\n\r\nAt the start of the academic year we will contact all registered trainees to confirm where you are living and to ask about the type of school that you would like to be placed in for your second placement. Where possible, we will try to accommodate your request and placements are arranged with a maximum commuting distance of 1 hour 15 minutes based upon the address provided. Travel time is usually significantly less than this.\r\n\r\nWe are able to offer contrasting placements in single-sex or mixed schools and in schools with sixth forms where your main placement school is 11-16.  Where you have completed a placement in a single-sex school your second placement will be in a mixed school or a school with students of the opposite sex.\r\n","personalQualities":"* Ability to engage interest and communicate your own enthusiasm for mathematics\r\n* Commitment to working with young people\r\n* Ability to explain ideas clearly and to think on your feet\r\n* Evidence of good interpersonal skills\r\n* Awareness of current educational issues\r\n\r\nPotential for Teaching \r\nPrevious experience of teaching or voluntary work in a school is desirable.\r\nSpend at least one day observing your subject being taught in a  secondary school and reference this in your application.\r\n\r\nDemonstrate an awareness of what good teaching entails (or why some teaching you experienced was bad) and indicate a desire to teach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"You should provide:\r\n* a reference which identifies your academic strengths and personal qualities required for teaching\r\n* a reference with no reservations about suitability e.g. relating to academic achievement, effort, health, commitment, consistency, group working skills, communication skills\r\n\r\nCandidates offered a place on a PGCE course will be asked to complete an enhanced check with the DBS to ensure they do not have a criminal background which might prevent them from working as a teacher.
