In the last research assessment exercise, the department was rated second in the UK (REF, 2014). You will have the opportunity to work with experienced tutors who are actively engaged in research in their subject and in pedagogy more widely. 94% of 2018 graduates who sought teaching posts were employed within 6 months of qualifying. In our 2020 student survey, 98% of trainees rated their training as good, very good or excellent.\r\n\r\nThis course aims to prepare students to:\r\n* become effective secondary school teachers\r\n* become knowledgeable subject specialists who can progress to take on responsibilities in curriculum development\r\n* become good classroom managers\r\n* become successful form tutors and collaborative colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe course encourages learning through critical reflection, making connections between the theory and practice of teaching, and continuing to self-evaluate and improve throughout a teaching career.\r\n\r\nWe work to enable students to teach pupils to think, and to interpret pupils' understanding, building their subsequent teaching on this.\r\n\r\nSchool Direct Route: The School Direct teacher training route is composed of a partnership between King’s College London and a lead school. Students apply to the lead school for admission to the course. The academic components of the course are delivered by King’s College London whilst the secondary school teaching experience is organised by the lead school.\r\n\r\nProgramme description\r\nThe PGCE in Geography is a full-time course that consists of four required modules and two blocks of teaching experience based in secondary schools within London and Greater London. You will complete the course within ten months, studying September to June. You must take modules totalling 120 credits to meet the requirements of the qualification. \r\n\r\nYou’ll engage in education, pedagogy and professional studies sessions and curriculum workshops. These will take place in both university and school settings and will develop your expertise in general educational and professional issues, as well as subject pedagogy. \r\n\r\nYou’ll gain the skills and understanding to take up positions in schools as a teacher of your subject with the potential to contribute fully to the life of the school. The course carries the Accreditation of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). \r\n\r\n[KCL Geography Course Information](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught-courses/pgce-geography)\r\n","interviewProcess":"The King’s process includes an interview, a group task and a short piece of writing.\r\n\r\nIn the interview and group task we will be looking for:\r\n\r\n* evidence that you have a commitment to working with young people;\r\n* ability to explain clearly and to think on your feet;\r\n* evidence of good interpersonal skills;\r\n* knowledge of school level science in each of biology, chemistry and physics;\r\n* familiarity with the realities of teaching science in secondary schools;\r\n*  awareness of current educational issues;\r\n*  commitment to equal opportunities;\r\n* ability to work well in a group dynamic.\r\n\r\nWriting\r\nIn your writing we will be looking for:\r\n* ability to express yourself clearly;\r\n*  accurate grammar and spelling.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"School Direct trainees start at their chosen school during the first week of the autumn term.
