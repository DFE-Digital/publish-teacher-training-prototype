In the last research assessment exercise, the department was rated second in the UK (REF, 2014). You will have the opportunity to work with experienced tutors who are actively engaged in research in their subject and in pedagogy more widely. 94% of 2018 graduates who sought teaching posts were employed within 6 months of qualifying. In our 2020 student survey, 98% of trainees rated their training as good, very good or excellent.\r\n\r\nThis course aims to prepare students to:\r\n* become effective secondary school teachers\r\n* become knowledgeable subject specialists who can progress to take on responsibilities in curriculum development\r\n* become good classroom managers\r\n* become successful form tutors and collaborative colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe course encourages learning through critical reflection, making connections between the theory and practice of teaching, and continuing to self-evaluate and improve throughout a teaching career.\r\n\r\nWe work to enable students to teach pupils to think, and to interpret pupils' understanding, building their subsequent teaching on this.\r\n\r\nProgramme description\r\nThis is a high-quality course (graded outstanding by Ofsted) that focuses on developing the subject knowledge that will enable all trainees to teach two Modern Foreign Languages with confidence in secondary schools. The course is skills-based, research-focused and developmental, aimed at promoting teaching skills based on a reasoned and elective methodology that integrates formative assessment practices, class management issues, technology awareness and research findings. \r\n\r\nStudents sometimes work with native speaker linguists from the Strand campus to develop linguistic competence and pedagogical awareness in a unique programme. Hispanists, Germanists and those with main French work with each other, sometimes working in language specific groups. There is a varied programme of tutor inputs, seminars, workshops and student presentations with considerable collaborative learning. Students are also required to undertake research and other independent learning tasks including data-collection from the classroom. \r\n\r\nThe ERASMUS programme enabling students to do part of their School Experience abroad is also a unique feature of this course available, although not guaranteed, for a small number of students who meet the requirements. \r\n\r\n[Course Information](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught-courses/pgce-modern-foreign-languages.aspx)","interviewProcess":"At interview, applicants will be asked to discuss their observations of time spent in a Secondary School MFL department (where this has taken place) as well as to share their vision of learning. \r\n\r\nApplicants will be asked to consider and then to present their ideas for teaching a grammatical structure or a lexical item selected previously prepared for the interview, in a micro-teaching format.\r\n\r\nOral and written competence will be tested. Applicants whose mother tongue is French, German, or Spanish will need to have an excellent command of spoken and written English. This will also be tested.\r\n\r\nPresentation\r\nIn your presentation that comprises a 5-minute teaching slot we will be looking for:\r\n* effective age-appropriate use of the target language:\t\r\n* ability to present concepts at a school level;\r\n* engagement with the audience;\r\n* use of simple resources (e.g. visual aids.

School term dates will be confirmed once your have accepted an offer.\r\n\r\nAround half of the schools within the Catholic Schools’ Partnership offer training placements. Those who are able to support the main placement are listed for each respective course.\r\n\r\nCandidates tend to apply to schools that are located close to where they live and we are happy to arrange tours and an observation day in your preferred school prior to application. \r\n\r\nAt the point of application please select your first choice of school.  Once your application has passed our vetting process you will be invited to interview at KCL and if successful at this stage this will be followed by an interview at the school.\r\n\r\nWe offer an ABA placement route with King's College London. This involves one long placement with a 6-week placement at another school within the CSP in the spring term before you return to your original school for the remainder of the course. \r\n\r\nAt the start of the academic year we will contact all registered trainees to confirm the area where you are living and to ask about the type of school that you would like to be placed in for your second placement. Where possible, we will try to accommodate your request and placements are arranged with a maximum commuting distance of 1 hour 15 minutes based upon the address provided. Travel time is usually significantly less than this.\r\n\r\nWe are able to offer contrasting placements in single-sex or mixed schools and in schools with sixth forms where your main placement school is 11-16.  Where you have completed a placement in a single-sex school your second placement will be in a mixed school or a school with students of the opposite sex.\r\n\r\nShould you have any questions relating to the placement structure, please do not hesitate to email c.barclay@catholicschoolspartnership.org.uk for more information.\r\n","personalQualities":" You should aim to demonstrate the following: \r\n* conceptual understanding of secondary school-based MFL teaching and learning\r\n* competence and certification in two foreign languages (French, German, Spanish), the main language at degree level and the second language to at least B2 level. \r\n* ability to think and reason clearly\r\n* clarity and accuracy of written and spoken communication\r\n* ability to interact with pupils and colleagues\r\n* strong motivation to teach\r\n* ability to recognise own shortcomings\r\n* flexibility of mind and potential necessary to improve.\r\n* ability to present ideas clearly and at an appropriate level.","otherRequirements":"All applicants for teacher training programmes must pass the Department for Education’s Literacy and Numeracy Skills Tests prior to commencing their teacher training course.\r\n\r\nThe Department for Education requires the Disclosure and Barring Service (formerly the Criminal Records Bureau) to vet the background of persons working in their schools. Candidates offered a place on a PGCE course will be asked to complete an enhanced check with the DBS to ensure they do not have a criminal background which might prevent them from working as a teacher. This must be completed before you register on the programme.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:55:42.601Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-17T12:56:15.507Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2023"}
