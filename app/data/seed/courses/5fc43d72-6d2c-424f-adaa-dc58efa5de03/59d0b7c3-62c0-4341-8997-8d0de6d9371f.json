The Catholic Schools' Partnership is, therefore, dedicated to developing staff with high expectations and a clear understanding of how to create a learning environment in which their students can flourish. Our focus is on developing teaching and learning through innovative ideas, creativity and intelligent collaboration. Our strong and supportive network is based on the shared values of our schools and colleges.\r\n\r\nGoldsmiths University\r\n\r\nThe School Direct Primary programme (PGCE + QTS) has three distinct modules. These are: \r\n•\tSchool Experience  \r\n•\tStudies and Professional Issues in Education \r\n•\tCurriculum Studies \r\n\r\nSchool Experience \r\n\r\nYou will spend approximately 6 weeks of the programme in University. In this time, you will have mix of lectures and small group seminars to support you in developing a strong and confident knowledge of the subjects you will be teaching in the primary classroom. Underpinning the programme is the Professional Studies course which is designed to prepare you fully for the wider roles and responsibilities of the teacher. \r\n\r\nThe Primary School Direct Programme is taught and assessed at Masters Level. In addition to a recommendation for QTS, if you pass all academic elements of the programme, you will also leave with level 7 credits equivalent to one-third of a master’s degree. Full academic support is provided to ensure you are fully prepared for assessment regardless of your prior experiences. \r\n\r\nStudies and Professional Issues in Education (SPIRE)  \r\n\r\nThe SPIRE module focuses upon issues that most impact upon the young person’s experience of education in the 21st Century.  In sessions you will be asked to: consider a range of issues relating to diversity and inclusion; engage with research and policy and link all of this to your own experience in the classroom.  In your written assignment you will choose one area from this module to reflect upon more deeply. \r\n\r\nCurriculum Studies  \r\n\r\nFor students following a School Direct pathway this module will focus specifically upon Learning Theory and will ask students to reflect upon the impact that research in this area has on the policy and practice of their school.   \r\n\r\nThe Early Years Primary School Direct Programme with the Catholic Schools' Partnership offers training for the 3-7 age group (with placement in EYFS and Key Stage 1).\r\n\r\n[Primary School Direct at Goldsmiths](https://www.gold.ac.uk/pgce/primary/)\r\n","interviewProcess":"At the CSP we are looking for candidates who can support our shared vision: Growing Teachers, Growing Learners, Growing Schools.  \r\n\r\nWhen applying please select your preferred school.
