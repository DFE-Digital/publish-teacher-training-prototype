The Catholic Schools’ Partnership is, therefore, dedicated to developing staff with high expectations and a clear understanding of how to create a learning environment in which their students can flourish. Our focus is on developing teaching and learning through innovative ideas, creativity and intelligent collaboration. Our strong and supportive network is based on the shared values of our schools and colleges.\r\n\r\nWe at the CSP are passionate about developing a generation of outstanding teachers and want to provide as much support as we can to ensure committed, enthusiastic and capable people make it on to our teacher training scheme. We offer excellent teacher training in partnership with St Mary’s University, with all courses resulting in a PGCE qualification.\r\n\r\nWe run an extensive CPD programme including two Early Career Conferences in the autumn and summer terms and School Study Visits in the spring term, providing networking opportunities and the chance to observe teaching in other schools within the partnership, in line with both your university studies and personal areas of development. Opportunities for school-based research and reflection, along with the sharing of outstanding expertise within a business-like model form the heart of our work.\r\n\r\nAn induction programme will be provided in school to supplement your university provision. The weekly sessions will cover a range of topics relevant to your training, including safeguarding; lesson planning, marking, and pastoral aspects such as the role of a form tutor. You will be fully involved in the life of the school attending parents’ evenings and participating in school trips.\r\n\r\nAbout the University Course\r\n\r\nThe Primary PGCE programme provides an intense training experience that combines academic rigour with personal and professional learning experiences. The training is designed to meet the needs of each trainee to support and develop the skills, knowledge and attributes needed to start a teaching career.\r\n\r\nThe PGCE is a 60-credit, Masters-level course and students must pass the two M-level modules and demonstrate that they have met the Teachers’ Standards.\r\n\r\n[School Direct Primary at St Mary's University](https://www.stmarys.ac.uk/postgraduate-courses-london/pgce-primary) \r\n\r\nYou will attend university training days at St Mary's University alongside students recruited via other routes and other School Direct partnerships.
