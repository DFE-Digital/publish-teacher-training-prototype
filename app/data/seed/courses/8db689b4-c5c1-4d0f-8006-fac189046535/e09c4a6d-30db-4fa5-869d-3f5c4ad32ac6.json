Applicants who can demonstrate some recent and meaningful experience working with young people will have a much better idea about what makes an effective teacher. This doesn't need to be paid work but any kind of helping activity, classroom observation or learning support helps to reinforce your application and discussion at interview. Candidates should be enthusiastic about their subject, have effective communication skills, an ability to understand written English and to speak and write clearly in English.
