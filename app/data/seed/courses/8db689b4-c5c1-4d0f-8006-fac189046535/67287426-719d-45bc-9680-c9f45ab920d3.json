Training sessions will take place every week in the form of twilight sessions, and over the course of the year there will be Professional Studies Days and Subject Days either at the Lead School or the University.\r\nThere will be a 4 week placement that you will undertake in a different school setting to gain a wider experience.

Candidates should be enthusiastic about their subject, have effective communication skills, an ability to understand written English and to speak and write clearly in English.
