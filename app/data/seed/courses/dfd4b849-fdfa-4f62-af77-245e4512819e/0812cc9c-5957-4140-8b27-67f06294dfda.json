Our courses have been highly rated in Ofsted inspections and Loughborough has been assessed as a category 'A' provider, representing 'outstanding' provision consistently.\r\n\r\nThe Loughborough PGCE course trains individuals to teach the 11-18 age range. All individuals on the PGCE course will experience teaching the 11-16 curriculum as well as post-16, and will be qualified to take up teaching posts in all secondary schools covering the 11-18 age range.\r\n\r\nThe Loughborough PGCE has been designed by university staff and teachers from schools, and is intended to set you on the path to becoming a well informed and reflective professional. The heart of the course is the development of your teaching competences. The course lasts 36 weeks and will give you teaching experience in two different secondary schools. Two thirds of the course is spent in schools where you will have the support and guidance of experienced teachers. For the rest of the time, you will work in the university with tutors and teachers who prepare you for your school experience, and guide you in making the important links between the theoretical and practical components of the course.\r\n\r\nOur course will help you to:\r\n\r\n* learn how to teach and relate to young people in a variety of learning situations;\r\n\r\n* develop the ability to plan sequences of lessons, and to teach and manage pupils effectively;\r\n\r\n* gain the confidence and competence to undertake your full role as a teacher within a secondary school;\r\n\r\n* develop sufficient knowledge and understanding of educational issues to be able to contribute effectively to the highest standards of teaching and learning, and to whole school improvement.\r\n\r\nAlongside teaching experience in schools, you will undertake two other elements within the course:\r\n\r\n1.Subject Methods courses in which you learn to teach Physical Education.\r\n\r\n2.General Professional Studies through which you come to understand the framework of the education system and how to contribute professionally to the wider role of the teacher responsible for the personal, social and health education of pupils.","interviewProcess":"You are required to attend an interview if you are selected for consideration for a place on this course \r\n\r\nThe selection process will determine whether you: have the intellectual capabilities needed to meet the Teachers’ Standards; possess appropriate qualities, attitudes and values expected of a teacher; are able to communicate clearly and accurately in Standard English.\r\n\r\nCareful consideration is given to every applicant.
