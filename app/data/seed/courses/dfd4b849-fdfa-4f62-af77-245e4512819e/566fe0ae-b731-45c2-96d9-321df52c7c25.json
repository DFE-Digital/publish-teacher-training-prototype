A pack of materials incorporating designated tasks and critical reading enables student teachers to make the most of this experience and also supports the completion of a preliminary assignment.  \r\n\r\nOn arrival in Leicester, students begin Phase A of their training, starting with an intensive University-based programme consisting of days devoted to subject work and days for the core Professional Studies Programme, which all students follow (A1). This helps prepare students for their first school placement, which at Leicester comes early in the PGCE course. By Christmas, everyone will have completed over a month's teaching in school (A2). Students then return to the same school after Christmas, continuing with their teaching for a further two weeks. \r\n\r\nA similar format is repeated in the second half of the year (Phase B). Some mainly University-based weeks (B1) lead into a substantial period of teaching experience in a different school (B2). A concluding spell in the same school, working on a subject project and other activities while continuing with a reduced teaching load, (B3) is followed by a final week in the School of Education.  \r\n\r\nWhat is taught on this course? \r\nThere are two inter-related strands: subject work and the Professional Studies Programme, with elements of both developed through taught sessions in the University and through practical teaching experiences in schools.  \r\n\r\n A number of features are common to all courses, regardless of the specific subject students are preparing to teach: \r\n\r\nClose links between the University and its partner schools/colleges, ensuring  placement experiences in different institutions draw on and inform each other  \r\n\r\nIndividual Action Planning that helps students identify their own development needs and make appropriate plans to fulfil them as they progress through the course \r\n\r\nSubject sessions, particularly in the early part of the course, which concentrate on fundamental matters such as lesson planning and evaluation, literacy, preparation of resources, adapting to various levels of pupil ability and the importance of assessment, recording and reporting achievement  \r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Our selection process is in two parts: School based interview and University based interview.  During the process you will participate in a small group discussion and presentation activity with candidates from a range of subjects.\r\n\r\nTeachers from Partnership schools are normally involved, as well as University Tutors.\r\n\r\nThe day will also involve:\r\n\r\n* An individual interview with the University Subject Tutor(s) and visiting teacher(s). You will be encouraged to demonstrate commitment to your subject, to reflect on relevant previous experience, and expand upon the skills, knowledge, experiences and aptitude that you can bring to your training.\r\n\r\n* A short subject specific written task which is designed to explore aspects of your subject knowledge and the quality of your expression*\r\n\r\nFurther details about the selection process are on the School of Education website http://www.le.ac.uk/education\r\n\r\n*The University of Leicester is committed to Equal Opportunities for all students and potential students, and support is available for candidates for whom this task might present a challenge. Potential applicants for whom this may be a consideration are advised to contact the Secondary PGCE team in advance.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Placements schools will be those within The lion heart Educational Trust.  Schools are selected to ensure a breadth of experience, though we will consider any preferences based on location.  You will have the opportunity to experience teaching across the 11-18 age range.\r\n\r\nThe placements are referred to as 'Phase A' and 'Phase B' placements.\r\nYour first placement is the 'Phase A' placement. \r\nAfter a two a two day induction you will then spend around 10 weeks in your first school. You will build on any existing experience and develop new skills with support from the school's ITT Co-ordinator and the subject mentor who will oversee your progress and professional development throughout.\r\n\r\nDuring your 'Phase B' you will spend about 12- 15 weeks in your second placement school. You will work again with the schools' ITT Co-ordinator and mentor who will work with you to develop and refine you as a classroom practitioner and ensure you have focused opportunities to strengthen your subject knowledge and pedagogical approach to teaching and build on your Phase A practice.\r\n\r\nThroughout the year there will be opportunities for our School Direct trainees to come together to share their experiences and build good practice on our CPD days, whilst on placement. This enriches your training experience and builds vital collaboration between trainees and their subject areas.\r\n\r\nThroughout your placements you will have weekly professional learning sessions that focus on all areas of your teaching practice and are underpinned by our Trust's key priorities in teaching and learning.","personalQualities":"We prefer all prospective students to have spent 10 days or more observing, and possibly assisting, learners and teachers in secondary science classrooms in order to familiarise themselves with current developments in science teaching. We welcome applicants who can provide suitable evidence of their engagement with practical work in the laboratory and demonstrate their interest in practical science.\r\n\r\nWe are interested in candidates showing enthusiasm for their subject in a variety of ways, for example, through their reading, leisure pursuits, attendance at local/national Science events.","otherRequirements":null,"status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:50:29.813Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-14T15:25:49.998Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2023"}
