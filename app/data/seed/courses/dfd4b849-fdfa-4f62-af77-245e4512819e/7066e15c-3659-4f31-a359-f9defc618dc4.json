The course will equip you to respond effectively to the issues currently affecting schools. We place a strong emphasis on developing your individual strengths and skills within the context of the contemporary education environment.\r\n \r\nThe award of PGCE is offered at two levels:\r\n*Professional Graduate Certificate in Education; and\r\n*Postgraduate Certificate in Education, where 60 Masters-level credits can be gained.\r\n \r\nBoth of these are recognised teaching qualifications but the postgraduate award will allow fast-track entry onto a Masters course. \r\nSuccessful completion of the PGCE leads to Qualified Teacher Status. The majority of your time will be spent on placement in schools or colleges. This practical teaching is supported by University-based lectures, seminars, workshops and tutorials exploring learning and teaching in your subject and in the wider context. Trainees also engage in an independent research project that draws together academic and professional practice.\r\n \r\nThe PGCE Computer Science with ICT course will enable newly qualified teachers to teach ICT and Computer Science with confidence, inspiring and challenging pupils in the 11 to 16 age phase.\r\n","interviewProcess":"The interview day - what to expect\r\n\r\nWritten task\r\nYou will complete an English test of your reading and writing ability so we can ensure that you have a good and accurate use of Standard English.\r\n \r\nIndividual interview\r\nYou will have an individual interview lasting around 15 minutes with a course tutor and, in some cases, a senior teacher from one of our partnership schools. The interview will focus on your personal qualities and skills, your suitability for teaching, your experience of working with young children in school settings and your current studies or employment.\r\n \r\nYou may be required to do other tasks during your interview, such as a presentation based on your teaching subject area, or a group activity.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"School or college experience is central to the Secondary PGCE at NTU. At least 24 weeks are spent on placement in at least two secondary schools or colleges. For both placements, training is planned by mentors to enable students to attain QTS. This practical teaching element is assessed on a regular basis via formal observation by a subject mentor and University tutors, enabling us to monitor each individual traineeâ€™s progress and effectively support their development. As a School Direct partnership your placements will be in two contrasting schools within the Lionheart Academies Trust and may be in city centre, suburban or semi-rural locations. This variety provides opportunities for a wide range of teaching experiences and lays a good foundation for your future professional development.","personalQualities":"","otherRequirements":"* Disclosure and Barring Service and Prohibition Order checks and a satisfactory health check passed prior to enrolling.\r\n\r\n* Two references - one academic and one vocational.\r\n\r\n* An interview with both the training school and NTU is part of the selection process.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:50:30.311Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-14T14:56:41.009Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2023"}
