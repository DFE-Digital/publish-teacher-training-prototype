The course will equip you to respond effectively to the issues currently affecting schools. We place a strong emphasis on developing your individual strengths and skills within the content of the contemporary education environment.\r\nThe award of PGCE is offered at two levels:\r\n*Professional Graduate Certificate in Education; and\r\n*Postgraduate Certificate in Education, where 60 Masters-level credits can be gained.\r\nBoth of these are recognised teaching qualifications but the postgraduate award will allow fast-track entry onto a Masters course. \r\nSuccessful completion of the PGCE leads to Qualified Teacher Status. The majority of your time will be spent on placement in schools or colleges. This practical teaching is supported by University-based lectures, seminars, workshops and tutorials exploring learning and teaching in your subject and in the wider context. Trainees also engage in an independent research project that draws together academic and professional practice.\r\n","interviewProcess":"The interview day - what to expect\r\n* Introduction to the Design and Technology PGCE\r\nYour interviewing tutor will give a short presentation on aspects of the course.
