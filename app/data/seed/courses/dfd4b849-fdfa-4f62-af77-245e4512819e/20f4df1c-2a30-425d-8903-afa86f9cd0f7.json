The course will equip you to respond effectively to the issues currently affecting schools. We place a strong emphasis on developing your individual strengths and skills within the context of the contemporary education environment.\r\nThe award of PGCE is offered at two levels:\r\n*Professional Graduate Certificate in Education; and\r\n*Postgraduate Certificate in Education, where 60 Masters-level credits can be gained.\r\nBoth of these are recognised teaching qualifications but the postgraduate award will allow fast-track entry onto a Masters course. \r\nSuccessful completion of the PGCE leads to Qualified Teacher Status. The majority of your time will be spent on placement in schools or colleges. This practical teaching is supported by University-based lectures, seminars, workshops and tutorials exploring learning and teaching in your subject and in the wider context. Trainees also engage in an independent research project that draws together academic and professional practice.\r\nDo you want to help pupils express themselves, to become critical thinkers and develop the vital skills they need to succeed, not just in English, but also in other areas of their education and beyond? Our PGCE in English will develop you into a teacher able to deliver the wide-ranging curriculum covered under English, including language, literature and supporting studies in drama and media education.\r\n","interviewProcess":"We will ask you to complete an activity and discuss your thoughts \r\nWe will ask you to plan and deliver a short presentation on teaching a key text to students\r\nYou will complete an English test of your reading and writing ability so we can ensure that you have a good and accurate use of Standard English.\r\nIndividual interview\r\nYou will have an individual interview lasting around 20 minutes with a course tutor and, in some cases, a senior teacher from one of our partnership schools.
