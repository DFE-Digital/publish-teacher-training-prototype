Loughborough has been acknowledged by Ofsted to be an outstanding provider for PGCE.\r\n\r\nHaving a good level of personal subject knowledge is important but what is equally important is having pedagogic subject knowledge, which concerns the way you might go about teaching that knowledge to someone else. The course will address a variety of ways in which the teaching of mathematics can be approached, of which telling and explaining are only two of the options available.\r\n\r\nThe course will involve you learning about such things as the National Curriculum, mathematics assessments and standard misconceptions. It will also challenge your thinking about what it means to work mathematically, what teaching involves, and what it means to say someone has learnt something.\r\n\r\nMost of the sessions will involve carefully chosen activities which allow you to experience personally some important issues relating to teaching and learning mathematics. Sessions will involve a significant amount of discussion which will arise from reflection upon activities, videos or readings.\r\n\r\nOn arrival in Loughborough, students begin Phase A of their training, starting with an intensive University-based programme consisting of days devoted to subject work and days for the core Professional Studies Programme. This helps prepare students for their first school placement, which at Loughborough comes early in the PGCE course. By Christmas, everyone will have completed over a month's teaching in their placement school. Students then return to the same school after Christmas, continuing with their teaching for a further two weeks. \r\n\r\nA similar format is repeated in the second half of the year (Phase B). Some mainly University-based weeks lead into a substantial period of teaching experience in a contrasting school. \r\n\r\nIt is situated within the Mathematics Education Centre which has an international reputation for research into teaching and learning mathematics at all ages. This enables the course to be research informed as well as practically based. The course offers 90 credits towards a Masters degree with a clear pathway to complete your Masters within two years of teaching.","interviewProcess":"You are required to attend an interview if you are selected for consideration for a place on this course \r\n\r\nThe selection process will determine whether you: have the intellectual capabilities needed to meet the Teachers’ Standards; possess appropriate qualities, attitudes and values expected of a teacher; are able to communicate clearly and accurately in Standard English.\r\n\r\nCareful consideration is given to every applicant. Loughborough University abides by its Equal Opportunities Policy. Ethnic minorities are currently under-represented in teaching and we particularly welcome applicants from such backgrounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Placements schools will be those within The Beauchamp Lionheart Trust.  Schools are selected to ensure a breadth of experience, though we will consider any preferences.  You will have the opportunity to experience teaching across the 11-18 age range.\r\n\r\nThe placements are referred to as 'Phase A' and 'Phase B' placements.\r\n\r\nPhase A\r\nYour first placement is the 'Phase A' placement. After induction you will then spend about 10 weeks in this school. You will build on existing experience and develop new skills with support from the school's \r\nCo-ordinator for Initial Teacher Training and the subject mentor who will oversee your professional development during the placement.\r\n\r\nPhase B\r\nDuring your 'Phase B' placement you will spend about 12 weeks in your second placement school. The Phase B school has a Co-ordinator and mentor who have similar roles and responsibilities as those in the 'Phase A' School.\r\n\r\nThroughout the year there will be opportunities for Beauchamp Teach School Direct trainees to come together to share their experiences and good practice in our CPD days, while on placements. This enriches the experience and builds vital collaboration between trainees and subject areas.","personalQualities":"","otherRequirements":"Applications are welcome from students with very good qualifications in their Mathematics at GCSE (grade A or above) and A level (grade C or above) or equivalent. Those students with joint or combined honours degrees in which mathematics is a major subject are also welcome to apply. In all cases applicants should be able to demonstrate a genuine interest in and enthusiasm for Mathematics at interview. This course prepares teachers who are fully able to teach up to A level and thus candidates need to have strong Mathematics subject knowledge.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:50:29.948Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-14T14:51:50.775Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2024"}
