At university, trainees undertake three Masters level modules towards their PGCE: Developing And Reflecting On Professional Practice and Developing And Reflecting On Subject Knowledge And Pedagogy. Successful trainees are awarded 60 Masters level credits which they can choose to carry forward to the full Master’s course at a later stage. Our School Direct programme provides a wealth of opportunity for trainees to demonstrate evidence of the Teachers’ Standards required for QTS.\r\n\r\nOur School Direct programme is designed to train teachers in the classroom. Our vision to develop expert teachers and leaders of the future starts with all trainees becoming part of the staff team from the beginning of the academic year. Trainee teachers will learn from experienced colleagues and work closely with the staff in the Mathematics department. You will be given experience of KS3, KS4 and KS5. The vast majority of the year is spent in the host school that you apply to and you will be allocated a contrasting placement which will include six weeks of teaching elsewhere. Contrasting placements are key to the development of all trainee teachers in order to develop a broader understanding of different educational settings.","interviewProcess":"Sheffield Hallam University’s Admissions Team will conduct an initial eligibility check to determine whether you meet the eligibility criteria. The school you have applied to will then consider your application. If you are selected for interview, you will be sent information about the interview process, together with guidance on how to prepare. The interview process will take approximately half a day at whichever school you have applied to within the alliance. It is important that you spend some time in the school that you are applying to so that you have an opportunity to talk to some key staff and get a feel for the setting. You will be required to teach an observed lesson and will be told in advance about the content and age group, as well as any other relevant information to help you prepare. At the end of the day you will be interviewed by the professional tutor with an Emmanuel Teacher Training Partnership representative present.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will spend the majority of the year and undertake most of your teaching commitments at your host school.
