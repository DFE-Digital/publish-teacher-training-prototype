Tollbar MAT aims to offer a world-class, 21st century education to the young people in all its Academies, providing life-long learning opportunities and creating centres of excellence, which model the successful practices at Tollbar Academy, bringing confidence and pride to the local community. To learn more about the Trust visit our website http://www.tollbarmat.co.uk/ \r\n\r\nTollbar MAT works closely with the University of Hull to offer teacher trainees a high quality programme which leads to Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) as well as enabling candidates to achieve a PGCE. The Secondary PGCE programme concentrates on the teaching of 11 - 16 year olds, but part of it extends your studies/experience to cover preparation for post-16 teaching. It is delivered by the University from its Hull campus together with Academies within Tollbar MAT. Our Academies are based in Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire region.\r\n\r\nTrainees spend one third of their course studying at the University with dedicated subject tutors, and the remainder is spent on two teaching practices in two Academies within the Trust. On placement every trainee has the benefit of both a professional tutor, and a subject specific, personal mentor to guide them through their teaching practice. \r\n\r\nGeography \r\nThe main aim of the course is to help you become a competent and engaging teacher of geography at secondary level. This is a process that began when you achieved graduate status in the subject and will continue throughout your career as a teacher.\r\n\r\nThe year will help convert geographers into geography teachers. The course concentrates on the teaching of 11-16 year olds, but part of it extends your studies/experience to cover preparation for post-16 teaching. The core areas of the course concentrate on:\r\n- Geography in the National Curriculum and the opportunities that it offers\r\n- Developing teaching approaches that will engage pupils of all abilities and backgrounds\r\n- The changing practices in assessment\r\n- Planning, preparing, teaching and evaluating quality geography lessons\r\n- The value and importance of fieldwork\r\n- The use of new technologies in the production of stimulating and engaging geography lessons\r\n\r\nEach session forges a practical link that will enable you to relate geographical theory to its direct impact on children in the classroom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"Applications should be made as early as possible, of the academic year immediately preceding the proposed date of entry.\r\n\r\nSuitable applicants will be called for interview. The interview process will involve staff from Tollbar MAT and University of Hull. Candidates will complete a teaching task and formal interview as part of the process. Full details are sent to each candidate who has been selected for interview. \r\n\r\nFor more information contact: \r\nPaul Donnelly - HR Officer and School Development for Tollbar MAT\r\nEmail: donnellyp@tollbarmat.org\r\nPhone: 01472 502299\r\n\r\nTeacher Education Team, Faculty of Arts, Cultures and Education, School of Education and Social Sciences, University of Hull, Hull, HU6 7RX\r\nTel: 01482 466028/465974\r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Practical Classroom Experience\r\nAll trainees have two school placements and teach in two Academies within Tollbar MAT. The two periods of teaching experience are approximately 12 weeks in length. Each teaching block is preceded by a developmental phase of structured preparation. This involves observing experienced teachers working with individual pupils, working with groups of pupils, team teaching, and eventually taking responsibility for whole lessons. In their practical teaching, trainees are advised and guided by their subject mentors in schools, and observed teaching by University Method Tutors. Trainees each have a Journal and Profile Document in which they and their mentors record their development. This document is both formative and summative because you use it throughout your training and it also contains two sections for completion at the end of each major period of teaching.\r\n\r\nTollbar MAT has extensive experience in supporting trainees through their placements. Staff at each of our Academies have a vast experience of supporting and guiding trainees to develop their craft. The Trust is keen to develop reflective practitioners who are passionate about delivering a high class education to our students. Subject mentors have received the necessary training from the University and are highly competent practitioners who are keen to aid the development of trainees. The Trust also allocates a senior member of staff on each site to oversee the support that trainees receive. During placements, bespoke sessions are ran for trainees to enhance their knowledge which underpins their classroom experiences.\r\n","personalQualities":"Personal Criteria\r\nWe a looking for someone who is:\r\n- Motivated to work with young people and enthusiastic about their subject.\r\n- Adaptable, hardworking and committed to teaching all pupils\r\n- Able to think on their feet, with good communication skills.\r\n- Work as a member of a team as well as being independent and resourceful.\r\n\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"Professional Requirements\r\nYou will be well qualified in your subject and to be able to talk about it with understanding and enthusiasm. \r\n\r\nExperience of working with young people or, at least evidence that you have done some research into teaching, such as undertaking some classroom observation, will be viewed positively.\r\n\r\nProtection of Children\r\nAdmission to all Initial Teacher Training programmes will be subject to the relevant Disclosure and Barring Service enhanced checks.
