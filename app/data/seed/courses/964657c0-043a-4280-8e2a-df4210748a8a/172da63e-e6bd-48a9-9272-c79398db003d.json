This will be the focus for your work with your Business Subject Tutors in the two schools to which you are allocated. For each week of the course there is identified a particular focus on which you should concentrate. ","interviewProcess":"Upon receipt of your application, the BPD Partnership will consider each candidate according to the selection criteria described above. Applicants are not expected to fulfil all of the additional requirements, but should be aware that these criteria will be applied in determining whether an applicant will be called to interview. Candidates who are selected for interview will normally be informed within 30 days of the receipt of their application. \r\n\r\n\r\nInterviews will take place at the relevant lead school and will include the opportunity to observe teaching. There will also be a number of tasks including a subject-based assessment, and a pupil interaction activity.  Candidates will complete a subject knowledge audit in advance of the interview. The exact format of the day will be determined by the number of candidates being interviewed and the timetable of the lead school for that day. The day will conclude with a formal panel interview, and applicants will be informed within 48 hours of the decision. The selection panel will take the evidence from all aspects of the day into consideration in making their judgement. Unsuccessful candidates will be offered feedback and a debrief on their application. \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The course runs for 37 weeks from September to July. During this time, trainees will spend the majority of their time (30 weeks) in school and a total of 7 weeks will be spent on central training covering both professional and subject-based themes, and academic sessions linked to the award of the PGCE.\r\n\r\nThe teaching programme in school is based on 2 placements. In the Autumn term in the first school, this commences with lesson observations and builds gradually to a maximum of a 50% teaching commitment by Christmas. Trainees spend the Spring & Summer term in their main school, which will provide a contrast to their first school. During this phase the teaching commitment will be around 60%, increasing slightly in the Summer term to a maximum of around 70% of a timetable. \r\n\r\nThe BPD  Business Studies course is a KS4 & 5(14-19) training programme. However, where possible trainees will be offered experience of KS3 teaching in a national curriculum subject according to their personal strengths (e.g. Maths, History etc) in order to enhance their employability after training.\r\n\r\nSchool placements are arranged on behalf of trainees and where possible such aspects as home location and travel are taken into account when allocating schools. Although the partnership consists of 14 schools, it should be noted that not all schools have the capacity to offer placements in all subjects.","personalQualities":"In addition to the academic entry requirements, the  Partnership applies the following criteria to judge whether an applicant may be offered a place on the course: \r\na) The ability to communicate clearly and accurately in both written and spoken English \r\nb) Some practical experience or similar recent connection with young people\r\nc) Details of appropriate referees who will provide confirmation of the applicant's suitability for teaching \r\nd) The ability to cope with the demands of an exacting profession \r\ne) Evidence of appropriate levels of commitment and motivation for successful study, including the intellectual capacity for academic study at Masters' level \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"Candidates who are successful at interview will also be required to demonstrate: \r\na) that they have no criminal convictions which might prevent them from working with children or young people, or as a teacher \r\nb) that they are physically and mentally fit to teach, and are capable of undertaking a course of study to become a qualified teacher ","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:49:45.105Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-08T21:27:21.542Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"}
