You will be encouraged to engage in a variety of activities in order to develop your own understanding, and will be supported in your use of different strategies for effective Science teaching. \r\n\r\na) To enable you to meet the objectives of the course towards the PGCE qualification and to show that you have achieved the standards which lead to being awarded Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) \r\nb) To prepare you to teach broadly across the whole Science curriculum for pupils in Key Stages 3 and 4, and to experience some post-16 specialist teaching. \r\nc) To interact with the Professional Studies programme in developing your understanding of the whole role of the teacher. \r\nd) To provide you with knowledge of the basic areas fundamental to the teaching of Science\r\ne) To help you plan, deliver and evaluate a variety of lessons effectively \r\nand develop a variety of styles and techniques for use within the classroom \r\nf) To give you the opportunity to discover your own personal qualities and talents as a teacher of Science\r\ng) To encourage reflection and critical evaluation of your practice and that of others, in order to improve the quality of your teaching \r\nh) To help you to understand the context of Science within your school \r\ni) To help you develop classroom management skills \r\nj) To enable you to become a professional colleague of other teachers \r\n\r\n You will have a series of subject pedagogy sessions in which you will develop some key skills, ideas and concepts of Science teaching. These will take place fortnightly. The majority of these sessions will take place at the main SCITT base, although some will take place at other locations as appropriate. \r\n\r\nYou will be able to share practice and discuss critically the progress you are making. You will have the opportunity to work collaboratively with fellow trainees and other colleagues, to develop new ideas and improve as teachers of Science.\r\n\r\nWithin your placement schools you will also follow a school-based Science subject pedagogy programme. This will be the focus for your work with your Science Subject Tutors in the two schools to which you are allocated. For each week of the course there is identified a particular focus on which you should concentrate. ","interviewProcess":"Upon receipt of your application, the BPD Partnership will consider each candidate according to the selection criteria described above. Applicants are not expected to fulfil all of the additional requirements, but should be aware that these criteria will be applied in determining whether an applicant will be called to interview. Candidates who are selected for interview will normally be informed within 30 days of the receipt of their application. \r\n\r\n\r\nInterviews will take place at the relevant lead school and will include the opportunity to observe teaching. There will also be a number of tasks including a subject-based assessment, and a pupil interaction activity.  Candidates will complete a subject knowledge audit in advance of the interview. The exact format of the day will be determined by the number of candidates being interviewed and the timetable of the lead school for that day. The day will conclude with a formal panel interview, and applicants will be informed within 48 hours of the decision. The selection panel will take the evidence from all aspects of the day into consideration in making their judgement. Unsuccessful candidates will be offered feedback and a debrief on their application. \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The course runs for 37 weeks from September to July. During this time, trainees will spend the majority of their time (30 weeks) in school and a total of 7 weeks will be spent on central training covering both professional and subject-based themes, and academic sessions linked to the award of the PGCE.\r\n\r\nThe teaching programme in school is based on 2 placements. In the Autumn term in the first school, this commences with lesson observations and builds gradually to a maximum of a 50% teaching commitment by Christmas. Trainees spend the Spring & Summer term in their main school, which will provide a contrast to their first school. During this phase the teaching commitment will be around 60%, increasing slightly in the Summer term to a maximum of around 70% of a timetable. \r\n\r\nThe BPD course is a KS3&4 (11-16) training programme. However, where possible trainees will be offered experience of post-16, whether as an observer or as a teacher of part of a lesson or a sequence of lessons if appropriate. At least one of the placements will be in an 11-18 or 13-18 school.\r\n\r\n\r\nSchool placements are arranged on behalf of trainees and where possible such aspects as home location and travel are taken into account when allocating schools. Although the partnership consists of 14 schools, it should be noted that not all schools have the capacity to offer placements in all subjects.\r\n\r\nCandidates should note that in most schools Physics teachers are expected to teach across the other Science disciplines at least in KS3, and often also in KS4. Candidates should therefore be prepared to teach outside their specialism.","personalQualities":"In addition to the academic entry requirements, the  Partnership applies the following criteria to judge whether an applicant may be offered a place on the course: \r\na) The ability to communicate clearly and accurately in both written and spoken English \r\nb) Some practical experience or similar recent connection with young people\r\nc) Details of appropriate referees who will provide confirmation of the applicant's suitability for teaching \r\nd) The ability to cope with the demands of an exacting profession \r\ne) Evidence of appropriate levels of commitment and motivation for successful study, including the intellectual capacity for academic study at Masters' level \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","otherRequirements":"Candidates who are successful at interview will also be required to demonstrate: \r\na) that they have no criminal convictions which might prevent them from working with children or young people, or as a teacher \r\nb) that they are physically and mentally fit to teach, and are capable of undertaking a course of study to become a qualified teacher ","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:49:44.918Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-12T19:10:03.202Z","cycle":"2024","fundingType":"fee","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no"}
