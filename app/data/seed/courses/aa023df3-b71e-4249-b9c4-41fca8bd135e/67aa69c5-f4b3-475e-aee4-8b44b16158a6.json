Study your chosen course over one year full-time or two years part-time, giving you the flexibility to fit your studies around your other commitments.\r\n\r\nUWE Bristol is committed to training the best teachers for the future, able to provide first-class educational experiences and make a significant difference to children's lives. We'll train you to do so in partnership with your schools or educational settings.\r\n\r\nTeaching is a challenging, exciting and rewarding career, with a high level of job satisfaction. It's a great privilege, as well as a great responsibility, to be able to influence and shape the progress of children and young people.  All children deserve to learn well, with enthusiastic specialist teachers.\r\n\r\nTo undertake the course, you must be in a role, or secure a role, in a school. This will enable you to undertake the required teaching practice specified by the Department for Education (DfE), which must be agreed by UWE Bristol before starting the course.\r\n\r\nYour teaching practice will need to include some time spent in an alternative placement school, ensuring you'll gain a variety of teaching experience.  The schools involved will need to support your engagement with and progression through the course.\r\n\r\nThe Primary phase is a broad and rewarding one and you'll have the opportunity to make a significant difference to the lives of the children you teach.  In the PGCE Online Distance learning Primary (5-11) you'll study the theory and practice to enable you to provide high quality education for children in Key Stages 1 and 2 of the National Curriculum.","interviewProcess":"","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You'll complete two school-based placements that you'll need to organise before starting the course.
