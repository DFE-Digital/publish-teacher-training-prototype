In the Autumn Term, the trainees are 'information gathering' by reading pedagogy from the latest theorists, observing excellent practitioners, attending training and unpicking the teacher standards. They also gradually build up to teaching a 40% timetable towards the end of the term. In this term, two short reflective pieces are written looking at traditional theories of education and looking at the impact of observed practice. There is also a focus on behaviour management, the essence of teaching and learning and writing lesson plans. \r\n\r\nIn the Spring Term, the trainees go on a placement in a different school and a different key stage. This is to appreciate a different age range and how to adjust your teaching accordingly and also to experience teaching the curriculum to younger or older children and the subject knowledge this involves. The teaching time increases to 60%\r\n\r\nThe Summer Term sees the trainees back to their base school to embed and refine their teaching practice. The teaching timetable increases to 80%.\r\n\r\nThe majority of time is spent in school to 'learn on the job'. Other times are spent at training sessions at Latchmere and some lectures at the university.\r\n\r\nThe trainees are assessed through evidence against the teacher standards via observations which occur on a regular basis. All feedback is advice!","interviewProcess":"At interview, the candidates sit the Kingston University maths and English tests. These are short tests and you do not need to revise for them. You will also read with a small group of children and here we are looking at how you engage with children, what questions you might ask them and what learning is taking place. Then there will be a panel interview. We invite heads from schools who are looking to employ a school direct trainee to form the panel. ","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"When you are offered a place, we will already know the school that you will be working at and we will tell you this on your offer letter. All the schools that take trainees are within the local authority of Kingston upon Thames.\r\n\r\nYou will begin your training as an employee of the school and, as such, you will follow that school's protocols. You will work alongside an experienced teacher and have a mentor at that school and will participate in all aspects of school life. This is your base school.\r\n\r\nThe second placement takes place in the 2nd half of the Spring Term. Latchmere Teaching School will organise this and the placement lasts for 6 weeks. You return to your base school for the Summer Term.\r\n\r\nWe take into account locality, family, travel distance, experience and many other factors when organising placements.","personalQualities":"We are looking for those who are passionate about improving outcomes for children. A school is a busy workplace so you need to be flexible, adaptable, resourceful and resilient.","otherRequirements":"All candidates are subject to a criminal record check and are asked to complete a health questionnaire.","status":2,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:52:01.200Z","canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","cycle":"2024","salaryDetails":"School Direct salaried trainees are paid on the unqualified teacher pay scale.
