Further information on additional sources of financial support can be found here: [Financial support](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/fees-funding/postgraduate/pgce/)","aboutCourse":"Good history teaching can and does take a variety of forms. The programme enables each individual student teacher to discover how best to use themselves and their talents to teach history effectively. The history programme is intellectually demanding and requires full commitment and a great deal of energy. You will need to be fit and well-prepared for a busy, but highly rewarding and exciting year. Our aim is for you to become a confident, reflective, innovative, and flexible teacher of history through: \r\n\r\n* collaborative working with other student teachers;\r\n\r\n* collaborative working with strong practitioners in partner schools;\r\n\r\n* introducing you to the underpinning concepts in history education which shape a history curriculum at KS3, GCSE, and A-level;\r\n\r\n* equipping you with a wide variety of strategies to engage, motivate and challenge students in the process of historical enquiry;\r\n\r\n* providing high level tuition at professional and Master’s level with leading subject specialists;\r\n\r\n* working in a variety of schools with different practices and comparing and contrasting those experiences;\r\n\r\n* participating in local and national history teacher professional networks;\r\n\r\n* participating in interdisciplinary initiatives which address global challenges.\r\n\r\nOur history PGCE graduates are sought-after for first appointments locally and nationally and employment rates are very high. The group of student teachers will have a range of age, work, and historical interests.\r\n\r\n‘I chose the University of Bristol because of their outstanding reputation. I was already aware of the high level of support that UoB tutors offer to their students. I could not be happier with my choice. The tutors got to know me and made sure my placement schools were places which would most develop my teaching skills. Not only did I graduate from the PGCE feeling confident and ready to start my NQT year, but I also have 60 credits towards a Master’s in Education.’ PGCE history student 2016-17","interviewProcess":"If the potential to be a good History teacher is evident in your application, we will invite you for an online interview. Interviews are conducted over a half-day, typically with a two-hour group interview, a 40 minute individual interview and a 20 minute written task. Interviews take place every 3-4 weeks and in line with our commitment to collaborative learning, for online interviews, we typically invite up to 8 applicants at any one time. We welcome applications from BAME candidates. \r\n\r\nYou will be interviewed by one or both of the University History tutors and, where possible, a teacher mentor from a local school. You will be sent material to read before interview and asked to prepare a short lesson starter activity. The interview process includes sharing of your lesson starter activity as part of a group, an individual task evaluating sections of a textbook, a discussion task about the role of a History teacher and an individual interview.   ","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Our stable and well-established Partnership compromises approximately 65 schools. Some are in the City of Bristol itself, and others are typically within a day’s commute of Bristol (around one hour travelling) - in North Somerset, South Gloucestershire, Bath and North East Somerset as well as a small number in Gloucestershire, Wiltshire and Somerset. We work with some schools in South Wales (e.g., Chepstow). The Partnership comprises a diverse range of schools and we are therefore able to offer opportunities to experience different contexts across the year, for example including schools with higher numbers of BAME and/or EAL pupils. Where appropriate, we are also able to offer experience in a special school.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYou will be placed in a minimum of two schools and when making placement decisions we take account of where you live as well as doing our best to accommodate personal circumstances. We know our Partnership schools well, however, and our priority is to place you in schools where your needs will be met, where you will be well-supported and have the opportunity to thrive. The majority of student teachers are required to travel for around one hour for at least one placement. \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOur programme comprises three distinct phases. During the Induction Phase (Autumn Term), you will complete a short teaching placement (5 weeks). During the Assimilation Phase (Spring Term) you will complete your main placement (typically 12 weeks) in a second school. During the Extension Phase (Summer Term), you will complete a final, shorter placement (5 weeks). Typically, this is based in the main placement school, but can often involve tailored experiences in other schools, gaining additional experience such as teaching pupils with EAL, focusing on Key Stage 5 teaching or experience in a special school. Whilst the majority of our Partnership schools teach pupils 11-18, some teach 11-16 or 16-19. Therefore, a priority when selecting placement schools is to ensure that everyone has experience of teaching across the age ranges including A level/BTEC classes. ","personalQualities":"We look for applicants with passion and who want to inspire the next generation. The PGCE is demanding but we’ll support you to become a confident and successful qualified teacher. \r\nAs our aim is for you to thrive and become a confident and successful teacher; we look for:  \r\n* good subject skills \r\n* good understanding of the secondary curriculum \r\n* awareness of current effective teaching and learning in your subject \r\n* interest and awareness of what working with young people involves \r\n* commitment to the state sector \r\n* communication skills \r\n* critical analysis \r\n* good organisation \r\n* reflection \r\n* resilience ","otherRequirements":"In addition to the academic entry requirements, all applicants will be subject to suitability checks.
