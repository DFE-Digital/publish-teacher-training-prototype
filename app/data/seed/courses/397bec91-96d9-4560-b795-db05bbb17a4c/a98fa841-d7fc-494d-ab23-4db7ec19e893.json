You will be supported by a very experienced mentor at both of your training schools. The course is offered in collaboration with the University of Reading, which has an outstanding record in teacher training.\r\n\r\nThe Court Moor Partnership is led by Court Moor School, one of the highest performing schools in Hampshire. All of our partner schools (all within easy commute of each other - in Fleet or Farnborough) are welcoming and supportive of trainees, and open to visitors who would like to observe some lessons and meet staff prior to applying.\r\n\r\nThe course has a good balance of time spent in university and at school, allowing trainees to spend their early phase at school observing lessons and learning how the school operates, before beginning to teach your first lessons. You will be assessed at the end of each term by your university tutor. QTS is awarded in June 2021, provided evidence has been met across the teaching standards.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Interviews are conducted by senior teachers. We usually ask candidates to teach a 'mini lesson' on an accessible topic with carefully selected students, followed by an interview.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Trainees will have two placements. These will always be at one of our partner schools (i.e. Fleet or Farnborough).\r\n","personalQualities":"Candidates must demonstrate an enthusiasm for their subject and a passion for working with young people to help them to fulfil their potential. Teachers must be innovative, committed and conscientious. Confidence is crucial, too, but it is something which can be developed during training.","otherRequirements":"All applicants will be required to successfully complete a DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) check before appointment.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:55:07.423Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-11T17:51:49.419Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2023"}
