Trainees will be continually assessed through lesson observations and placement reports whilst on teaching placements, and through a series of 3 short assignments.\r\nDetailed portfolios of evidence are submitted 3 times during the year to demonstrate how trainees are meeting the Standards for Qualified Teacher Status. Following the first 2 submissions, trainees receive feedback on their progress.\r\n","interviewProcess":"The first thing we look at is your application form and your references to decide whether or not we should invite you for interview. It is, therefore, important to include all the relevant information on the form to help us make this decision. If you have a disability, please let the school know in advance if there are any special arrangements that should be made for the interview process, for example large print copies of documentation, additional time for reading or wheelchair access to the interview rooms. The interview will be held in your chosen school.\r\nThe selection process will be in 2 stages. If you are invited to interview, you will be sent information about a 15 minute teaching task.\r\nOnce you have completed Stage 1 you will be told by a member of the panel whether or not you have been selected to go through to Stage 2. At this point you will also be given verbal feedback.\r\nStage 2 will consist of a formal interview and other activities which may be used to identify training needs.\r\nYour performance on the day will be assessed against criteria linked to the Standards for Qualified Teacher Status.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Trainees have the opportunity to gain experience in 11-16/11-18 comprehensive schools/academies; special schools (EBD); a school with BESD status; Sixth Form colleges and primary schools.
