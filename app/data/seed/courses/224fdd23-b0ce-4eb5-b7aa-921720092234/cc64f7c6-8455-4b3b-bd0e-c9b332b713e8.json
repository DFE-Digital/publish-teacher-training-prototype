These include physical activities considered to be less conventional compared to more established types of activities. The A-list includes the following non-conventional physical activities:\r\n\r\n* Alternative – Physical activities that depart from or challenge traditional norms and are considered to be non-traditional in a UK context such as tchouckball, kinball and korfball.\r\n* Adapted – Physical activities suited to pupils with additional learning needs but that can also be practiced by all pupils within secondary schools such as boccia, goalball and new age kurling.\r\n* Artistic – Physical activities related to cultural and artistic forms of dance.\r\n* Aesthetic – Physical activities that are creative and involve a combination of movements requiring precision, fluency and control such as urban gymnastics, cheerleading and trampolining.\r\n* Aquatic – Physical activities that take place in or on the water such as swimming, synchronised swimming, water aerobic dancing, water polo, life-saving and personal survival.\r\n* Athletic – Physical activities that require physical skill, agility and stamina such as street surfing.\r\n* Adventurous – Physical activities that require precise problem-solving and decision making skills such as orienteering and climbing.\r\n* Aerobic – Physical activities that are sustained and require low to high intensity such as jogging, rowing and cycling.\r\n* Anaerobic – Physical activities that are non-endurance activities involving speed strength and power such as sprinting, jumping, and throwing.\r\n\r\nOur tutors and mentors will advise and support you throughout each placement. You will receive comprehensive feedback during this time, enabling you to see what you are doing well and where you might need to improve. You will have the opportunity to organise group activities which reflect contemporary expectations of physical education teachers and the individual needs of pupils from diverse backgrounds. The campus is excellently equipped with multimedia training materials, giving you the opportunity to develop your confidence and competence in the use of ICT.\r\n\r\n * The Weald School is the only school with a Sixth Form \r\n","interviewProcess":"If you have applied for a School Direct place with us, you need to expect two interview stages - the first with the university, the second with the school offering the place.\r\n\r\nThe university interview will be with staff from the School of Education and the department of your subject. They will also want to check your documentation to ensure you are eligible and compliant, so it’s worth looking for the originals of GCSE, degree and marriage certificates before that interview. If you haven’t got them, or haven’t yet finished your degree, you will be given time to order copies and showing then mot the university will become part of any conditional offer you might be made. Copies can take up to six weeks and there is a charge, so factor that in to your planning.\r\nIf successful at the university stage, you will then be invited to a school-based interview which will take two to three hours. You will be expected to:\r\n\r\n-\tteach a short part of a lesson on a specific topic; you'll be given  information as to the numbers in the group, their ability and the point they are at in that topic.\r\n-\tgive a short presentation to the interview panel – this is likely to consist of senior subject and leadership staff, possibly the Headteacher\r\n-\tcomplete a written task\r\n\r\nIf you are unsuccessful at the university stage, it is unlikely that the school will proceed any further with your application.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"On the School Direct route, you have applied to train at a specific school and, following interview, have been offered and accepted a place at that school. You therefore know where your first school will be, unlike those on the PGCE route. \r\nYou will start at your school in mid-late September and will have a few days of  induction to settle you in. You'll stay at this school until February half term and will be on site most of the week; on some weeks you may have additional training days at university. You'll be very much part of the school and the more you join in, the more you'll get out.\r\nAfter February half term, you will move to another school for your short  second placement which lasts for most of the second half of the spring term. This second placement is sorted by the Lead school late in the Christmas term and under the directive given by the ITT criteria, must provide a contrasting experience to your host school.  As with all second placements, you must expect up to 40 minutes travel.\r\nIf you have a child in a school in the partnership, you wouldn't be placed there, so please make this known early on. \r\nYou will return to your host school for the last week of the Spring term and the first half of the summer term when your training year will finish. You would expect to be awarded QTS (Qualified Teacher Status) towards the mid/end of June.","personalQualities":"We are looking for ambitious trainee teachers who are passionate and enthusiastic about their subject and have a desire to share that with young people of all abilities in this particular age range. Strong subject knowledge will make your training year easier. \r\nYou must like working with young people and making a difference to their lives; resilience and patience are also key qualities.\r\nAlthough school experience is no longer a compulsory requisite, we do feel that you should have a basic understanding of the challenges of education before you commence your training.\r\n","otherRequirements":"DBS checks will be carried out by the university for those on the SD tuition route.","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:48:11.120Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-08T07:53:44.251Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2024"}
