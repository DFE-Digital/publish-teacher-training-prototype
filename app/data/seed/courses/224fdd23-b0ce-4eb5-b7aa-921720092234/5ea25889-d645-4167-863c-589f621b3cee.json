They will also want to check your documentation to ensure you are eligible and compliant, so it’s worth looking for the originals of GCSE, degree and marriage certificates before that interview. If you haven’t got them, or haven’t yet finished your degree, you will be given time to order copies and showing then mot the university will become part of any conditional offer you might be made. Copies can take up to six weeks and there is a charge, so factor that in to your planning.\r\nIf successful at the university stage, you will then be invited to a school-based interview which will take two to three hours. You will be expected to:\r\n\r\n-\tteach a short part of a lesson on a specific topic; you'll be given  information as to the numbers in the group, their ability and the point they are at in that topic.\r\n-\tgive a short presentation to the interview panel – this is likely to consist of senior subject and leadership staff, possibly the Headteacher\r\n-\tcomplete a written task\r\n\r\nIf you are unsuccessful at the university stage, it is unlikely that the school will proceed any further with your application.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"You will need a six-week second placement which must be in a contrasting key stage.","personalQualities":"We are looking for ambitious trainee teachers who are passionate and enthusiastic about their subject and have a desire to share that with young people of all abilities in this particular age range.
