Trainees will experience placements in mainstream and special school settings.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Qualified Teacher Status (QTS), trainees will achieve a PGCE from the University of Leeds. This evidence-based research will support trainees’ critical thinking about behaviour and barriers to learning related to teaching children with learning difficulties.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the programme, trainees will be equipped to complete their NQT induction in mainstream and special school settings.\r\n\r\nThe course provides a broad range of teaching experience across Key Stages 1 and 2. \r\n\r\nIn the Primary year groups, creativity is at the heart of our teaching, both in the core subjects of English, Maths and Science, and across the full breadth of National Curriculum Primary subjects.\r\n\r\nYou’ll enjoy working with many inspirational teachers from across the partnership, showing you how they continuously strive to improve practice in the classroom, and enable progression across the full range of Primary year groups. You’ll also develop inspirational and innovative techniques to enthuse and engage young people.","interviewProcess":"For the foreseeable future, interviews will be held virtually on Microsoft Teams.\r\n \r\nPreparation for the interview will include:\r\n\r\n* Workload prioritisation activity\r\n* Plan for a pupil activity\r\n\r\nYou will be given the opportunity to meet current trainees and course leaders. \r\n \r\nWhen it is possible to access schools freely, we shall ask that you conduct a pupil activity and complete a written English test.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Please note that the only placements remaining are in Scarborough.\r\n\r\nWe have a large partnership of schools, meaning our trainees have flexibility when it comes to placements. Our trainees can also benefit from the placements our partners can offer, which can vary from rural settings to the buzz of the city. \r\n \r\nWhen allocating main placements, we consider trainee preferences, transport and location. Our dedicated team work hard to organise placements early, giving you as much time as possible to make arrangements.\r\n \r\nAll trainees undertake two main placements. The first placement runs from the first day of the Autumn Term until December. The second placement, in a contrasting school environment, runs from January until late June. \r\n \r\nTrainees will also take part in mini placements across the year, which give trainees a unique opportunity to broaden their experience in a range of schools and contexts.\r\n","personalQualities":"\r\n* Passionate about making a difference to the lives and development of young people\r\n* Independent, resilient and adaptable\r\n* Friendly and approachable, with the ability to engage young people\r\n* Enthusiastic about their subject and are continuing to develop their subject knowledge\r\n* Creative and imaginative\r\n* Good organisational skills and excellent time management skills\r\n* Reflective and strive to improve their own practice\r\n* High standards of spoken and written English\r\n* Demonstrate a professional attitude\r\n* Have made a considered and informed decision to train to teach\r\n","otherRequirements":"Experience of being in a school and/or working with young people is not essential, however, it will be beneficial during the application process.
