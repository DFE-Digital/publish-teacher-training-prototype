You’re in one school four days a week to the end of the school year, spending spring half term at a contrasting school. One day a week you’ll be at with our partner ITT provider, Kirklees and Calderdale SCITT, sharing and learning from each other’s experiences. Our model enables you to experience a full year in school and fully appreciate the demands/rewards that brings.\r\nWorking alongside your mentor, you’ll identify your ongoing level of knowledge, skills and experience and from that draw up and work continuously on a training plan. This will involve observing experienced teachers and training activities leading to delivering whole class.\r\nYour core training is extremely diverse from theoretical input to observing excellent practice. We support our trainees throughout their training year, enabling them to be fully prepared for teaching during their training and beyond.\r\nIn order to gain Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) you have to be judged competent against the Teacher Standards.\r\nAssessment includes -\r\n•\tHalf-termly Tutor visit reports\r\n•\t3 termly reports\r\n•\t2nd school placement report\r\n•\t3 Reflection Points (training activities which focus on a group of standards feeding into 2 Assignments)\r\nWe work hard to create a reduced workload approach to assessment, basing many of our judgements on professional dialogue - not paper trails. Assessment is based upon day-to-day practice and should complement your teaching and reduce the amount of additional work required.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Once we receive your application, we’ll acknowledge by email and update UCAS if you are invited to interview. We’ll e-mail or call you with the details.\r\nYou’ll be interviewed at Kirklees & Calderdale SCITT by colleagues from our partnership and the SCITT.\r\nYou’ll be expected to answer a range of questions designed to explore your personal qualities and meeting the course criteria. The interview gives you the opportunity to discuss why you want to teach, what you would bring to the profession, and show us your resilience and initiative. You will be asked to bring a prepared task and you’ll undertake a written task on the day demonstrating your ability to read effectively and communicate clearly and accurately in Standard English.\r\nYou’ll need to bring interview original certificates of all qualifications and proof of identity as part of our Safeguarding processes. If you are successful, we’ll offer you a place. Ideally within 48 hours. We’ll update UCAS and contact you.

If you have a school in mind, you’re welcome to approach us about it and we’ll work with you to arrange the best experience for you. You will be placed in a school which we feel will fully support you in your subject specialism.\r\nYou will spend most of the year in one school with a second experience in a contrasting school (usually Christmas to February half term). This enables you to deepen your experience and ensures that you have the opportunity to meet all the Teacher Standards. When in school, you are expected to follow the timings, practices and culture of the school. Having an extended practice in one main school means that you can develop your practice well and show that you have a positive impact on your pupils, in your own classes. We always try to take into consideration the location of our trainees and their placement schools to assist in their daily commute and try to work around other personal situations.\r\n","personalQualities":"We aim recruit excellent candidates who have the drive and ambition to become outstanding teachers and want to improve the lives and development of children.
