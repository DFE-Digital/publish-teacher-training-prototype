You can bring other forms of photo ID for the selection event, but if you do, you will still need to present valid identity documents required by the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) at your pre-course day.\r\n\r\nThe selection event is a process which assesses if you're suitable for a place on the course. It's a chance to show us your knowledge about the subject and your enthusiasm for the career. Being invited to a selection event doesn't mean you're guaranteed a place on the course - the point of the day is to help us come to a mutual decision. We need to decide whether to make you an offer and you need to decide whether you like the course and the university.\r\n\r\nWe aim to make the interview process as rigorous and informative as possible. It's very much a two-way process, where you can evaluate what we offer while we find out more about you. In order to help us explore your thinking and subject knowledge, and for you to decide if this is the right course for you, we have a number of activities we usually use as part of the interview process.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"School-based training is an integral part of the course, and you will work with pupils in key stages 3 and 4 and also have Post-16 experience. \r\n\r\nWe offer the course in partnership with local and regional Secondary schools, which play a key role in the teaching and assessment of your professional competence against the teachers' standards.\r\n\r\nIn total you spend 120 days in school over the year.\r\n\r\nYou will be assigned a school-based mentor for your placement.","personalQualities":"We are looking for the next generation of outstanding teachers and future school leaders.
