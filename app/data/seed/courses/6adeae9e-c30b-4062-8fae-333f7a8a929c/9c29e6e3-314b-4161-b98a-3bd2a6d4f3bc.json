It is a flourishing comprehensive school with a small, family-feel. The school opened in September 2016 for its first 120 students and is now at full capacity with years 7 to 11. The school supports its students to make exceptional progress through its innovative curriculum design; students study EBAC subjects every morning and then have extended lessons in the afternoon focussing on the more practical and creative areas of the curriculum.  In 2021 the first year of students sat their GCSEs with 81% achieving grade 5+ in English and Maths. \r\n\r\nThe Trust's ethos is strongly and distinctively Christian, with an emphasis on developing socially responsible individuals with a sense of their own capacity to do and be good.  The Twyford Trust prides itself on embracing 'life lived to the full' - a Christian-based concept it has developed as the 10:10 ethic.\r\n\r\nThe School Direct Computing programme at Ealing Fields begins in September 2022. Upon successful completion of the training programme in summer 2023, you will gain Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).\r\n\r\nAll schools in the Teach West London Ealing secondary partnership are highly supportive and inspirational environments where you will develop the necessary skills and acquire a true appreciation of the practice essential for outstanding teaching and learning.
