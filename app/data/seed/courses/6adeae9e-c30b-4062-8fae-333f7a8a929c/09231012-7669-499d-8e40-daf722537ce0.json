The Trust's ethos is strongly and distinctively Christian, with an emphasis on developing socially responsible individuals with a sense of their own capacity to do and be good. The Trust prides itself on embracing 'life lived to the full'; a concept that we have developed as our 10:10 ethic.\r\n\r\nAda Lovelace opened as a Free School in September 2018 and last year we moved into our new school site with year groups 7 through to 10. \r\n\r\nThe School Direct programme at Ada Lovelace School begins in September 2022. Upon successful completion of the training programme in summer 2023, you will gain Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).\r\n\r\nAll schools in the Teach West London Ealing secondary partnership are highly supportive and inspirational environments where you will develop the necessary skills and acquire a true appreciation of the practice essential for outstanding teaching and learning. You will learn your craft in a safe environment which allows you to experiment with teaching styles, strategies and ideas.\r\n\r\nYour training will be delivered by expert teachers within the school. You will participate in weekly professional development sessions which will cover a wide range of topics and school policies which will be of use to you in your subject area and in the school as a whole. \r\n\r\nYou will be assigned an experienced mentor from within your subject area at Ada Lovelace who will support you in your development over the course of what will be a challenging and rewarding year. All mentors are excellent teachers who are well-trained in mentoring, coaching, lesson observations and feedback skills. ","interviewProcess":"Shortlisted applicants will be invited to an interview at school and to take part in some or all of the following activities: a presentation; a written task; small group teaching; curriculum discussion and an interview. You will be told in advance if you are required to prepare a presentation or to teach. Hillingdon SCITT will also attend the interview at school, where possible, and be part of the selection panel.\r\n\r\nIt is a rigorous and thorough process designed to ensure successful applicants are well placed to succeed.\r\n\r\nPlease note that we recruit on a rolling basis and usually offer only one position per subject area (unless otherwise stated). We suggest that you apply early as popular subjects are filled quickly.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"As well as your main training placement at Ada Lovelace CE High School, you will complete a six-week placement in a contrasting context within Ealing; this will afford you the opportunity to experience working with different students, within different structures and with a wider range of colleagues.","personalQualities":"We seek to appoint applicants who exhibit a passion for and excellent knowledge of their subject and a commitment to the education of all young people.  \r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that all successful applicants will participate fully in the life of the school and therefore it is essential that trainees are very well organised, hardworking and enthusiastic. \r\n\r\nWe look to appoint those with the potential to become outstanding teachers, with this in mind, it is crucial that applicants are resilient, reflective and responsive to advice.","otherRequirements":"You must have 3 years full-time (or equivalent) work experience (this does not have to be from an educational setting).\r\n\r\nSchool experience is also essential if you are interested in applying for School Direct at one of the Teach West London Ealing secondary partnership schools. We prefer that candidates have up to 10 days of recent experience in a UK school. If you have arranged some classroom experience but it is yet to take place, please make a note of this in your application.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-12T13:48:34.198Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-05T14:30:18.397Z","canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","cycle":"2023","salaryDetails":"Teach West London Ealing secondary partnership Salaried School Direct trainees will be paid on the Unqualified Teacher Pay Scale (Band A, Inner London) area.\r\n\r\nTeach West London Ealing secondary partnership schools offering Salaried places in Maths, Physics and Computing will pay trainees at least Â£25,000 as a result of additional funding being offered by the government. \r\n\r\nSalaries for other subjects will vary depending on the subject and salary.\r\n\r\n"}
