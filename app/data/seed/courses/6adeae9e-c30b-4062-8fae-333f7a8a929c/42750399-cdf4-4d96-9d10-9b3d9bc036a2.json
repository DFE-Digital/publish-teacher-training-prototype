The Twyford Trust aims to deliver outstanding education in a comprehensive school setting, and embraces the Twyford School motto 'Life in all its fullness', encouraging students to use their individual gifts wisely and well. The atmosphere at the school reflects this. It is upbeat, positive and energetic with an emphasis on high engagement.\r\n\r\nTwyford is currently heavily oversubscribed and there are now almost 1000 students in Years 7 -11 and over 500 students in the 6th Form. Alongside its specialisms of Science, Languages and Music, the Arts at Twyford also have a very high profile at the school with regular productions, exhibitions and performances. In its most recent Ofsted inspection, Twyford School was graded as outstanding , the highest grade attainable in an Ofsted inspection.\r\n\r\nThe School Direct Geography programme at Twyford School begins in September 2021. Upon successful completion of the training programme in summer 2022, you will gain Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).\r\n\r\nAll schools in ETSA are highly supportive and inspirational environments where you will develop the necessary skills and acquire a true appreciation of the practice essential for outstanding teaching and learning. You will learn your craft in a safe environment which allows you to experiment with teaching styles, strategies and ideas.\r\n\r\nYour training will be delivered by expert teachers within the school. You will participate in weekly professional development sessions which will cover a wide range of topics and school policies which will be of use to you in your subject area and in the school as a whole. You will also attend Alliance-wide Golden Day training events along with fellow ETSA trainees. Your school-led training will be complemented by attendance at the St Mary's University in Twickenham.\r\n\r\nYou will be assigned an experienced mentor from within your subject area at Twyford School who will support you in your development over the course of what will be a challenging and rewarding year. All mentors are excellent teachers who are well-trained in mentoring, coaching, lesson observations and feedback skills. You will also work closely with a member of the Senior Leadership team who will oversee a great deal of your training and will provide an invaluable perspective on your role as a teacher and the wider issues of education leadership.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Shortlisted applicants should expect to first attend an interview at St Mary's University. \r\n\r\nIf successful, applicants will then be invited to an interview at school and to take part in some or all of the following activities: a presentation; a written task; small group teaching; curriculum discussion and an interview. You will be told in advance if you are required to prepare a presentation or to teach. \r\n\r\nIt is a rigorous and thorough process designed to ensure successful applicants are well placed to succeed.\r\n\r\nPlease note that we recruit on a rolling basis and usually offer only one position per subject area (unless otherwise stated). We suggest that you apply early as popular subjects are filled quickly.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"As well as your main training placement at Twyford School, you will complete a six-week placement in a contrasting context within ETSA.\r\n\r\nThis will afford you the opportunity to experience working with different students, within different structures and with a wider range of colleagues.","personalQualities":"We seek to appoint applicants who exhibit a passion for and excellent knowledge of their subject and a commitment to the education of all young people. \r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that all successful applicants will participate fully in the life of the school and therefore it is essential that trainees are very well organised, hardworking and enthusiastic. \r\n\r\nWe look to appoint those with the potential to become outstanding teachers, with this in mind, it is crucial that applicants are resilient, reflective and responsive to advice.\r\n","otherRequirements":"You must have 3 years full-time (or equivalent) work experience (this does not have to be from an educational setting).\r\n\r\nSchool experience is also essential if you are interested in applying for School Direct at ETSA. We prefer that candidates have up to 10 days of recent experience in a UK school. If you have arranged some classroom experience but it is yet to take place, please make a note of this in your application.\r\n","status":2,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:49:59.983Z","canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","cycle":"2023","salaryDetails":"ETSA Salaried School Direct trainees will be paid on the Unqualified Teacher Pay Scale (Band A, Inner London) area.\r\n\r\nAll ETSA schools offering Salaried places in Maths, Physics and Computing will pay trainees at least £25,000 as a result of additional funding being offered by the government. \r\n\r\nSalaries for other subjects will vary depending on the subject and salary.\r\n"}
