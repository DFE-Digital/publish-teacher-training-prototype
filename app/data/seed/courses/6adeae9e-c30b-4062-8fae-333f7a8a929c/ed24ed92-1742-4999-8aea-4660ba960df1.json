It is a high performing school and its value added has been consistently in the top 20% of schools nationally. In 2015, pupil achievement placed us in the top 100 non-selective schools in England. Elthorne Park's mission statement: Achieving Excellence in a Learning Community, highlights its belief that everyone within the school is a learner, that everyone can excel with the support and challenge of others and that all achievement will be celebrated together.\r\n\r\nThe school's balanced curriculum aims to enable all students to become successful learners, who enjoy learning, make progress and achieve; confident individuals who are able to lead safe, healthy and fulfilling lives; and responsible citizens who make a positive contribution to society.\r\n\r\nThe School Direct Computing programme at Elthorne Park High School begins in September 2022. Upon successful completion of the training programme in summer 2023, you will gain Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) plus Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).\r\n\r\nAll schools in the Teach West London Ealing secondary partnership are highly supportive and inspirational environments where you will develop the necessary skills and acquire a true appreciation of the practice essential for outstanding teaching and learning. You will learn your craft in a safe environment which allows you to experiment with teaching styles, strategies and ideas.\r\n\r\nYour training will be delivered by expert teachers within the school. You will participate in weekly professional development sessions which will cover a wide range of topics and school policies which will be of use to you in your subject area and in the school as a whole. You will also attend Alliance-wide Golden Day training events along with fellow trainees. Your school-led training will be complemented by attendance at the Hillingdon SCITT.\r\n\r\nYou will be assigned an experienced mentor from within your subject area at Elthorne Park High School who will support you in your development over the course of what will be a challenging and rewarding year. All mentors are excellent teachers who are well-trained in mentoring, coaching, lesson observations and feedback skills. You will also work closely with a member of the Senior Leadership team who will oversee a great deal of your training and will provide an invaluable perspective on your role as a teacher and the wider issues of education leadership.","interviewProcess":"Shortlisted applicants will be invited to an interview at school and to take part in some or all of the following activities: a presentation; a written task; small group teaching; curriculum discussion and an interview. You will be told in advance if you are required to prepare a presentation or to teach. Hillingdon SCITT will also attend the interview at school, where possible, and be part of the selection panel.\r\n\r\nIt is a rigorous and thorough process designed to ensure successful applicants are well placed to succeed.\r\n\r\nPlease note that we recruit on a rolling basis and usually offer only one position per subject area (unless otherwise stated). We suggest that you apply early as popular subjects are filled quickly.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"As well as your main training placement at Elthorne Park High School, you will complete a six-week placement in a contrasting context within Ealing.\r\n\r\nThis will afford you the opportunity to experience working with different students, within different structures and with a wider range of colleagues.","personalQualities":"We seek to appoint applicants who exhibit a passion for and excellent knowledge of their subject and a commitment to the education of all young people. \r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that all successful applicants will participate fully in the life of the school and therefore it is essential that trainees are very well organised, hardworking and enthusiastic. \r\n\r\nWe look to appoint those with the potential to become outstanding teachers, with this in mind, it is crucial that applicants are resilient, reflective and responsive to advice.\r\n","otherRequirements":"School experience is also essential if you are interested in applying for School Direct at one of the Teach West London Ealing secondary partnership schools. We prefer that candidates have up to 10 days of recent experience in a UK school. If you have arranged some classroom experience but it is yet to take place, please make a note of this in your application.\r\n\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:50:03.093Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-06T11:37:53.259Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2023"}
