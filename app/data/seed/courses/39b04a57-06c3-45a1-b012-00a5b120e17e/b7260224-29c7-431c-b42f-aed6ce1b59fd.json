Our Initial Teacher Training (ITT) Partnership includes a number of excellent schools across the Black Country where trainees will spend the majority of their time. School Direct trainees enjoy more time in school than their PGCE Core counterparts, learning and honing their craft at the chalkface!\r\n\r\nWe work in unison with The University of Worcester as one of our HE providers to deliver a high-quality training programme for our trainee teachers. \r\n\r\nStour Vale offer a comprehensive Professional Studies programme which includes training in all aspects of school life. Trainees attend theory sessions with Stour Vale one day a week with the rest of their time being spent in school or university. Sessions are designed to support trainees' development in the core areas of the Core Content Framework (CCF) and provide a valuable insight into pedagogical approaches. The PGCE element of the course is assessed in university where trainees complete assignments throughout the year, all of which, alongside successful school placements, must be passed in order to gain Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). Successful trainees also gain 60 Masters credits.\r\n\r\nTrainees spend the Autumn and Summer Terms in their lead school and the Spring Term in another school to gain experience of a different context. The Autumn term will consist in observing lessons and working collaboratively with other teachers, and trainees will be teaching independently around October half-term. Teaching allocations will then be increased gradually over the next two terms. \r\n\r\nAll trainees are fully supported by both their subject and their professional mentor in school where they will apply what they have learned in Professional Studies into the classroom. The subject mentor will provide subject-specific support, including access to the latest teaching and learning strategies in order to become a confident teacher. In addition to school and university support, the Stour Vale Central Team will be with you at every stage of the course to provide professional guidance, expert pedagogical knowledge, along with heaps of advice, support, and encouragement!\r\n\r\nFor the latest information on places and locations, please contact teach@svat.org.uk.","interviewProcess":"For applications through The University of Worcester, candidates will attend an interview with their lead school which will include a presentation and formal interview questions with subject and course leaders from the school and Stour Vale. Candidates will also be asked to deliver a lesson or part-lesson. This could be face-to-face with pupils, or remotely to the interview panel made up of representatives from Stour Vale and the lead school. We will provide further details upon application. \r\n\r\nInterviews with the lead school may be online OR face-to-face. Where possible, we encourage all applicants to visit their lead school prior to interview and support candidates in arranging this.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We discuss placement schools at the application stage. In all cases, the applicant's own circumstances will be considered so that travel times are not inconvenient. A full, clean driving license and access to a car is desirable, but not essential.\r\n\r\nSuccessful candidates will spend the Autumn and Summer Terms at their host school and the Spring Term in a second placement at a different school. \r\n\r\nAll trainees are allocated a subject mentor and a professional mentor within school. Teaching timetables are staged, and trainees will be expected to be teaching independently by the end of the first term.\r\n\r\nWeekly meetings and observations will be designed to fully support the trainee's needs and help them to develop as classroom practitioners.\r\n\r\nAll trainees are allocated a subject mentor and a professional mentor within school.

You will also need to be a confident communicator who will contribute to a great team spirit. ","otherRequirements":"\r\n* Full criminal/DBS checks will be carried out upon application. \r\n* Trainees without the relevant degree may well be expected to take a Subject Knowledge Enhancement course.\r\n* Fitness to Teach: Admission to the course is subject to a satisfactory medical report, as you are required to meet the standards for Fitness to Teach.
