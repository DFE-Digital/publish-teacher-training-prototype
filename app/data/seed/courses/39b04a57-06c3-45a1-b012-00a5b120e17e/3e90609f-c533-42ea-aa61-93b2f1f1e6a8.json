Our Initial Teacher Training (ITT) Partnership includes a number of excellent schools across the Black Country where trainees will spend the majority of their time. School Direct trainees enjoy more time in school than their PGCE Core counterparts, learning and honing their craft at the chalkface!\r\n\r\nWe work in unison with Haybridge Alliance SCITT (accredited through Birmingham City University) as one of our HE providers to deliver a high-quality training programme for our trainee teachers. \r\n\r\nHaybridge offer a comprehensive Professional Studies programme which includes training in all aspects of school life. Trainees attend theory sessions at Haybridge one day a week with the rest of their time being spent in school. Sessions are designed to support trainees' development in the core areas of the Core Content Framework (CCF) and provide a valuable insight into pedagogical approaches. The PGCE element of the course is assessed alongside this programme of study. Trainees work through three modules throughout the year, all of which must be passed to gain Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). \r\n\r\nTrainees spend the Autumn and Summer Terms in their lead school and the Spring Term in another school to gain experience of a different context. Autumn term will consist in observing lessons and working collaboratively with other teachers, and trainees will be teaching independently around October half-term. Teaching allocations will then be increased gradually over the next two terms. \r\n\r\nAll trainees are fully supported by both their subject and their professional mentor in school where they will apply what they have learned in Professional Studies into the classroom. The subject mentor will provide subject-specific support, including access to the latest teaching and learning strategies in order to become a confident teacher. In addition to school and university support, the Stour Vale Central Team will be with you at every stage of the course to provide professional guidance, expert pedagogical knowledge, along with heaps of advice, support and encouragement!\r\n","interviewProcess":"For applications through Haybridge SCITT, candidates will attend an interview with their lead school which will include a presentation and a formal interview with subject and course leaders from the school and Stour Vale. Candidates will also be asked to deliver a lesson or part-lesson. This could be face-to-face with pupils, or remotely to the interview panel made up of representatives from Stour Vale and the lead school. We will provide further details upon application. \r\n\r\nInterviews with the lead school may be online OR face-to-face. Where possible, we encourage all applicants to visit their lead school prior to interview and support candidates in arranging this.\r\n\r\nSuccessful candidates are required to take an English and Maths skills test just before or at the very start of the course. \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"We discuss placement schools at the application stage. In all cases, the applicant's own circumstances will be considered so that travel times are not inconvenient. A full, clean driving license and access to a car is desirable, but not essential.\r\n\r\nSuccessful candidates will spend the Autumn and Summer Terms at their host school and the Spring Term in a second placement at a different school. \r\n\r\nAll trainees are allocated a subject mentor and a professional mentor within school. Teaching timetables are staged and trainees will be expected to be teaching independently by the end of the first term.\r\n\r\nWeekly meetings and observations will be designed to fully support the trainee's needs and help them to develop as classroom practitioners.\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for people who first and foremost believe in the power of education to transform the lives of young people, whatever their background and ability. You will be hard-working, with an enquiring mind and have the resilience to stay the course. Teaching is the most rewarding job in the world, but it is also, like all professions, a challenging one. You will be supported all the way, but we also want you to be independent, a critical thinker, reflective and self-aware. You will also need to be a confident communicator who will contribute to a great team spirit.
