This school-led course includes a one-week induction to prepare you for your placement and weekly sessions to develop your knowledge of the curriculum.  \r\n\r\nWe focus on school student learning right from the start of the PGCE and this encourages our trainees to develop very quickly as teachers. You will be well supported by subject experts in both school and University and welcomed into a warm and friendly PGCE team who will challenge you to become the best teacher that you can be. All academic assignments focused around pupil progress and your classroom practice. On successful completion, you will receive 60 Masters level credits with Qualified Teacher Status (QTS), which is governed by DfE regulations.\r\n\r\nYou will be very well supported during your time on the course and will benefit from a designated subject mentor in school who will hold weekly meetings with you, help you teach and review lessons, develop your subject knowledge and set and monitor agreed targets. \r\nIn addition, you will have a University Tutor who will oversee your overall development as a teacher. Improvement Planning sessions in the University will take place to support you throughout the year with your University Tutor. \r\n\r\nAs a trainee, you will be given a phased introduction to teaching that will reflect your personal needs. You will normally begin by observing the regular class teacher, helping with group work and then moving towards sharing classes with the teacher before eventually taking classes yourself. As well as teaching, you will be expected to contribute generally to the life of the school. \r\n\r\nThe blend of practical experience and University study gained during your course will be assessed through the compilation of portfolios of evidence and the production of short written academic papers. \r\nTo see posts about activities that we run during the PGCE course and for details of our upcoming events and open days please visit the [Staffordshire University website](http://www.staffs.ac.uk/) or our [PGCE Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/StaffsUniPGCE/).\r\n","interviewProcess":"Following an initial screening to ensure your application meets our entry requirements, applications will be submitted to the Subject staff for review. Successful applicants at this stage will be offered an interview. \r\n\r\nThe main purposes of the interview are to: \r\n* Allow you to understand as fully as possible the nature of the course, the teaching profession and your commitments to it \r\n* Begin to explore your subject strengths and areas for development\r\n* Assess your ability to communicate effectively in spoken and written English \r\n* Answer any questions you may have\r\n\r\nWhilst school experience is not a requirement for being invited to interview, successful candidates will be able to demonstrate during their interview that they have a good understanding of student learning and progress. Applicants may wish to draw upon experiences from their own education or paid or voluntary work in schools or with school-age children to show evidence of their understanding.\r\n\r\nFurther information about tasks for the interview will be detailed in an interview invitation. Please note that for some activities preparation prior to the interview may be required. \r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"The quality of our relationships with our schools and colleges is extremely high and is based on a shared vision of teaching and a genuine partnership.
