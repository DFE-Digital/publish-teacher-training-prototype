These involve work in studying key concepts that underpin the various curricula and syllabi for your subject or phase. The sessions allow discussion of different pedagogies and allow reflection on differing school approaches to develop your appreciation of what works and how.\r\n\r\nTrainees will be welcomed as full members of the staff team and encouraged to immerse themselves in all aspects of school life including professional development days, monitoring and evaluation activity, extra-curricular activities and community events.\r\n\r\nAssessment\r\n\r\nQTS Pathway – all students\r\nThroughout the course you will be assessed by your mentors and tutors who will grade you at key points to help you understand how well you are meeting the standards for QTS. At the end of the course you will have a final assessment. This will take the form of a review meeting to formally assess whether you have met the standards for QTS.\r\n\r\nSchool Direct PGCE Pathway\r\nIn addition to the above assessment process for the recommendation for QTS students who have opted for the School Direct PGCE Pathway will be required to submit three 4,000 word equivalent assignments, spread across the year, which will be assessed at Masters Level.","interviewProcess":"Each candidate shortlisted for interview will be notified directly and by email from our team. \r\n\r\nIf candidates are notified that they have been successful in securing an interview, they may wish to visit the lead school prior to the interview.\r\n\r\nInterviews will be generally be held at the school to which you are applying and will be conducted by senior teachers and the Head of Department. Some panels will also include a representative of the University and/or the Partnership.\r\n\r\nCandidates will be asked to complete a subject knowledge audit, which will form part of the discussions at interview in assessing your readiness to teach specific areas of the curriculum and to identify any requirements for subject knowledge enhancement prior to the starting the programme.\r\n\r\nCandidates should be able to discuss their recent relevant educational experience, which should be based on their work with children or young people.\r\n\r\nCandidates will be expected to demonstrate relevant skills through a brief teaching activity. You will also be asked to give a short, prepared presentation and complete short mathematics and literacy tasks.\r\n\r\nWe also require candidates to bring proof their qualifications to interview, including their degree certificate. This is to ensure that there are no subsequent problems with eligibility to train.\r\n\r\nWe are happy to respond to questions from candidates prior to interview.

As Kent is a selective authority, we tend to swap those in one setting with the contrasting one for their second placement.","personalQualities":"We are looking for ambitious trainee teachers who have a passion for education, are positive, enthusiastic, organised, creative, flexible, patient and have a desire to share these skills with young people of all abilities in our schools.\r\n\r\nIt is an advantage to have experience of to have experience of British mainstream schools. \r\n\r\nKnowledge of the curriculum, the challenges a school may face in raising standards and the ability to talk about what makes for great teaching are particularly important.
