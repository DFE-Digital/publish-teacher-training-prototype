The sessions allow discussion of different pedagogies and allow reflection on differing school approaches to develop your appreciation of what works and how.\r\n\r\nTrainees will be welcomed as full members of the staff team and encouraged to immerse themselves in all aspects of school life including professional development days, monitoring and evaluation activity, extra-curricular activities and community events.\r\n\r\nAssessment\r\n\r\nQTS Pathway – all students\r\nThroughout the course you will be assessed by your mentors and tutors who will grade you at key points to help you understand how well you are meeting the standards for QTS.
