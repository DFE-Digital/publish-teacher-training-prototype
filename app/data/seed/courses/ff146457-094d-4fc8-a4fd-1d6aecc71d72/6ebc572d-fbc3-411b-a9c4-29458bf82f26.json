Additionally, you should be able to demonstrate an enthusiasm and genuine interest in and understanding of young people and the teaching profession.","otherRequirements":" In line with current safeguarding practice,  we (or the employing school) will carry out a number of pre-employment checks, including taking up references and a DBS Clearance check for all trainees prior to the start of the course.","status":2,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:36.615Z","canSponsorSkilledWorkerVisa":"no","cycle":"2023","salaryDetails":"As a Salaried School Direct applicant, you will be employed and paid on the bottom of the unqualified teacher scale by your placement school for the duration of your training placement.There are no tuition fees attached to this course and upon successful completion of the training programme, applicants will receive the award of QTS.
