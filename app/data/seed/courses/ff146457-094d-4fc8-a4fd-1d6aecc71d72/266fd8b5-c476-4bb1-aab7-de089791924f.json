We would encourage applicants to familarise themselves with the Teacher Standards and the relevant Secondary GCSE curriculum - as well as the current issues effecting education and schools. As Salaried applicants are required to deliver a teaching timetable from the outset - it would be helpful if they have had some previous relevant experience - although this is a recommendation and not an entry requirement.   Additionally, you should be able to demonstrate an enthusiasm and genuine interest in and understanding of young people and the teaching profession.","otherRequirements":"All applicants to ITT courses are now required to pass the Professional Skills Tests in Numeracy & Literacy prior to commencing their training.
