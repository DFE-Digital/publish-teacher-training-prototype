All PGCE tuition fee trainees will be in school for the equivalent of  four days per week increasing to five days per week in the final term. This course is offered through the Lead School of Robert Bloomfield Academy in Shefford in conjunction with our Partnership schools throughout Bedfordshire.\r\n\r\nThe main strength of our training provision, is that we are small enough to treat every trainee as an individual and as such, we are able to tailor the training experience to meet individual requirements.\r\nIt is our belief that teachers are best trained when there is a high level of involvement in the training by qualified teachers - and an extensive immersion in school life. Consequently, all of our trainees are allocated subject specific mentors who will oversee and monitor trainee progress and development.\r\n\r\n Underpinning  the practical aspect of the training, are the academic taught courses which operate at the end of the school day on a twice weekly basis. The Professional Studies course aims to connect theory and practice  and addresses the Standards for QTS and will involve assessment via three assignments (one each term). Additionally, all trainees will attend the Subject Application course which is delivered by the Subject Leaders as a small group subject based tutorial programme - addressing the required subject knowledge for teaching.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the course, all trainees will be able to achieve the prescribed Standards for newly qualified teachers in secondary education and additionally all of our Tuition Fee courses offer the award of a university validated PGCE with the option of gaining credits towards a Masters qualification. \r\n","interviewProcess":"Applications received by The Bedfordshire Schools' Training Partnership are subject to initial shortlisting by the relevant Subject Leader. Shortlisted candidates are then invited to attend an interview which consists of two subject knowledge based tasks (one written), a practical classroom focussed exercise as well as basic literacy & numeracy testing. Successful candidates are then informed of the outcome within two working days of the interview date.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"As a Secondary School training provider, trainees will be allocated a base school placement within a Secondary School as well as a shorter complementary placement during which time they will be allocated a subject specific mentor to oversee their training and development.\r\nThese placements will be located across Bedfordshire within our Partnership schools. We will endeavour where possible, to  place trainees within a reasonable travelling distance of their home (typically half an hour by car)\r\n","personalQualities":"We welcome applications from all suitably qualified applicants. We would encourage applicants to familarise themselves with the Teacher Standards and the relevant Secondary GCSE curriculum - as well as the current issues effecting education and schools.  Additionally, you should be able to demonstrate an enthusiasm and genuine interest in and understanding of young people and the teaching profession.","otherRequirements":"In line with current safeguarding practice,  we will carry out a number of pre-employment checks, including taking up references and a DBS Clearance check for all trainees prior to the start of the course.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:56:36.806Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-20T13:44:56.372Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2023"}
