Well-being of trainees is crucial and we have developed a strong mechanism to support trainees in this respect.  A qualified counsellor is available at no cost to you.\r\n\r\nOver the course you will produce an e-portfolio of evidence, monitored by TCP and your school(s).  You will also have assignments to complete and your teaching will be observed regularly, with feedback to ensure strong classroom practice.\r\n\r\nOur Design Technology course includes Food, which forms part of the Design Technology curriculum. We would welcome applications from anyone wishing to train to teach Food.\r\n\r\nIn November 2017, TCP was graded “good” by Ofsted and we shall be pleased if you view our final report on the OfSTED website.","interviewProcess":"","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Placements will be in CMAT schools across the academy trust.","personalQualities":"","otherRequirements":"","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:49:01.069Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-13T08:42:20.632Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2024","applicationsOpenDateOther":"2021-11-28T00:00:00.000Z"}
