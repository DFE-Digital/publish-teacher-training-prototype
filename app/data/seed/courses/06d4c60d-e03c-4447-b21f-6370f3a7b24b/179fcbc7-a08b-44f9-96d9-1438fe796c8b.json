a meeting with a subject mentor and a subject-specific training session provided by one of the subject mentors. \r\n- During the two block teaching practices regular meetings with mentors and subject-specific training sessions continue though the other sessions mentioned above are discontinued. \r\n\r\nWhat is taught on this course:\r\n\r\n- Subject knowledge \r\n- Teaching methodology \r\n- ICT skills \r\n- General professional studies topics such as how children learn, education in a multi-ethnic society etc. \r\n- What it is to be fully involved in all aspects of the life of the host school. \r\n\r\nAssessment is by a variety of methods: \r\n\r\n- A portfolio of evidence built up over the full course \r\n- A standards log to measure your progress against the DfE standards as in Qualifying to Teach \r\n- A number of presentations and three longer assignments which aim to develop powers of observation and reflection, the ability to relate published data to your own classroom research and, finally, the ability to experiment with different teaching styles and methodologies. \r\n\r\nStudy facilities and support:\r\n\r\n- The scheme supports Associate Teachers with relevant ICT equipment. \r\n- A small professional library is kept at the lead school and course members have access to specialised material at the University of Leicester.\r\n","interviewProcess":"Applicants who are invited to interview would normally spend a day in one of the Partnership schools. During this time they would be given a tour of the school and spend time talking to staff and pupils in classes. They would be interviewed by one of the Directors of the scheme and by a subject mentor. During the interview they would be asked, depending on their subject, to give a short presentation/speak in their foreign language/complete a subject specific test/deliver a short practical. \r\n\r\nIn addition, all candidates are asked to complete a generic, short written task and numeracy task.\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Arrangements for teaching placements:\r\n- Associate teachers spend the first week of the course observing in a primary school (this is organised by the trainee at a school of their choice) \r\n- From the second week of the course Associate Teachers are based in one of the Partnership schools except for the ten weeks of their main block practice when they will be placed in one of the other schools in the Partnership. \r\n\r\nWe value the experiences that our Associate Teachers bring with them and we try to be flexible in meeting their particular needs when placing them in their host schools.\r\n\r\nIn order to find the most suitable placement for each trainee, we look at the distance they would have to travel from home to school, the age ranges they will be teaching and the availability of the most appropriate School Based Tutor.\r\n","personalQualities":"Associate Teachers are selected from a wide age range with a good balance of people in their 20s, 30s and 40s. Some will be straight from university; others may have had considerable experience of another career. A majority of our Associate Teachers come from within a 25 mile radius of the Partnership schools. \r\n\r\nSuccessful candidates are able to show:\r\n\r\n- A commitment to teaching which may be demonstrated by evidence of previous work with young people. \r\n\r\n- An ability to communicate effectively with pupils and with adults. \r\n\r\n- A genuine interest in sharing enthusiasm for their subject\r\n","otherRequirements":null,"status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:51:23.332Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-09T09:46:31.630Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"no","cycle":"2023"}
