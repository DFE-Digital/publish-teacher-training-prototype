Alongside your students, you will explore the vast number of physical and human connections that exist within our world and the pressures that the world’s natural environments face. You will also have the opportunity to broaden your specialist subject knowledge by teaching Physical, Human and Environmental Geography - we will support you with this! \r\n\r\nYou will deliver exciting lessons that discuss the natural processes that affect millions of people every year like volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and tsunamis, how climate change is affecting populations and how population change is itself affecting different countries. \r\n\r\nYour classroom will be brimming with opportunities for students to explore the world through images, film clips, stories of personal experiences and of course, maps! \r\n\r\nOn completion of this programme, you will be awarded a PGCE with QTS and 60 Masters credits in Education from the University of York.
