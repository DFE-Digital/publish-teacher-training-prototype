The loan is not means -tested and covers the full amount of the tuition fees. These are paid direct to the University when you enrol on a PGCE course. You would repay the loan after you have graduated and are earning over £25,000.\r\n\r\nMaintenance Loan\r\n\r\nThis is available to help you with your living costs. The amount you will receive depends on your household income (parents’ or partner’s income plus yours) and the loan is repayable once you have finished the course and are earning over £25,000.\r\n\r\nA bursary or scholarship may also be available for this subject. Details of bursaries and scholarships available for 2022 - 2023 will be announced soon.

This will be further enhanced by attendance on a number of days at our partner University, Manchester Metropolitan University. BSA supplement this classroom placement experience with a structured continuous professional development programme throughout the year. \r\n\r\nDuring the PGCE year you will complete three placements (across two consecutive key stages) in two Bury schools within the Alliance. You will work alongside happy and friendly children and hardworking and ambitious staff. With full support and thorough preparation you will share the responsibility for planning and teaching your own classes. \r\n\r\nThe programme is highly personalised from your first contact with us at Bury Schools Alliance to taking up your first teaching job, hopefully in one of our alliance partner schools. To date, all of our School Direct students secured employment in their NQT year. Several of our former students now hold middle and senior leadership roles in local schools. Other graduates have chosen to use their skills to teach overseas. \r\n\r\nStudents will complete four assessments over the year. This is in the form of two written assignments, one presentation and a portfolio of evidence. Each assessment contributes 15 M level credits towards a PGCE and all are led and marked by University tutors. Student must pass all assignments and their Teaching Experience (TE) to achieve qualified teacher status (QTS).\r\n\r\nOn completion of the programme, successful students will gain 60 credits at Masters level, which they may use towards a future continuing professional development qualification, they will be awarded a PGCE and be recommended for Qualified Teacher Status. \r\n\r\n","interviewProcess":"All applications are checked to ensure they meet course entry requirements by our partner university, MMU. Applications which fulfil this criteria are then shortlisted by the BSA admissions panel. Successful candidates will be invited to attend an interview ( this will be online if Government guidance regarding Covid restrictions mean face to face interviews are not permitted) to assess their potential to participate effectively and enthusiastically in the School Direct course.\r\n\r\nAs well as a formal interview with senior practitioners from our Alliance, you will be asked to prepare a 12 minute lesson plan based around a specific learning objective for a particular year group in advance. You will then deliver the short lesson to a group of children. The interviewers will observe the lesson, discuss it with the candidate and give feedback.\r\n\r\nIn order to assess your writing ability and grammatical knowledge you will be sent a written piece and asked to produce a handwritten piece of writing. The written task is designed to assess the quality of written English and understanding of current issues in education. The standard of spoken English will be assessed throughout the interview. Short Maths and SPaG tests are completed on the day.\r\nThese tasks enable us to get to know you, your engagement with pupils and to identify whether we may be able to organise additional support through MMU, for example, with course assignments. \r\n\r\n","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"BSA works on an A B A model where you will complete two school placements A and B; placement A in the autumn and summer terms at one of the schools in the Bury  School Alliance and placement B in the spring term where you will be allocated to a different school within the alliance. \r\n\r\nOur alliance schools offer dynamic and diverse settings within which to train. You will get experience of working with young people of all abilities. You will also have a 5 day inclusion placement in a special school to give you the experience of working with learners in all phases and contexts. We can offer additional SEN experience, due to our very close links to Elms Bank Specialist Art College, should you have an interest in Special Educational Needs and Disabilities. Over the course you will experience time in Early Years, Special, Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2 and Secondary settings.\r\n\r\nThe first placement will start early September and involves teaching practice in school each week, with weekly Professional Study/ Training Days over the year delivered by outstanding colleagues from our Alliance schools. This provides an opportunity to discuss teaching experiences with the whole School Direct cohort in Bury, share ideas and learning and access further training opportunities to suit the requests and needs of students. This placement ends at the end of the autumn term and trainees return after Easter. The second placement starts in January and ends before Easter. We have the capacity to tailor training to suit the needs of the student cohort.\r\n\r\nYou will have full access to the facilities of The Manchester Metropolitan University, which has national recognition for its high quality Initial Teacher Training provision. The majority of your time will be school based but there are a number of days where you will be based at the University, far reduced compared to a traditional PGCE.\r\n\r\n","personalQualities":"We are looking for inspiring, knowledgeable and ambitious trainees who are passionate and enthusiastic about teaching to make a real difference to young peoples' lives and futures. If this is you, and you have the following attributes, we want to hear from you!\r\n\r\n* The confidence and ability to engage with children\r\n* Commitment to excellence in education\r\n* Excellent communication and organisational skills\r\n* A commitment to working hard\r\n* An ability to establish good working relationships\r\n* Commitment to a professional team\r\n* Flexibility - a crucial characteristic that is vital in this active and constantly changing climate\r\n","otherRequirements":"All teachers are expected to be competent in Fundamental English and mathematics. Initial Teacher Training (ITT) providers are expected to make an assessment of English and mathematics knowledge of a student before QTS is awarded. Skills will be assessed during course induction. Additional support can be provided to ensure you meet these conditions by the end of your training programme.\r\n\r\nSchool experience is no longer required for you to apply to train to teach with us. BSA do understand, and recognise, the value of school experience and should you wish to arrange this we would be happy to help you.\r\n","status":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T10:55:11.739Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-24T08:00:59.806Z","canSponsorStudentVisa":"yes","cycle":"2023"}
