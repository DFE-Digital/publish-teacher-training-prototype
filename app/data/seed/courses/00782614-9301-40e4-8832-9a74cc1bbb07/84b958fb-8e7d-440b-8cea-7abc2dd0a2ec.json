Trainees will achieve QTS and be enrolled on a Masters Programme with the University of Derby for the award of PGCE.  Training is majority school-based with some centre-based training. Training occurs at various locations across Essex so we take into account your home address to try to keep travelling time to a minimum.  You will receive training on the general aspects of successful teaching and training specifically aimed at preparing you to teach maths in primary.  \r\n\r\nIn school you will work closely with a subject / phase specific mentor and the ITT co-ordinator, who will meet regularly with you to assist you with your training plan.   You will also have an external tutor who works for Essex Teacher Training, who will visit you in school 5 times in the year to check on your progress towards meeting the Teachers' Standards.\r\n\r\nThe PGCE is delivered locally in Essex by the University of Derby and comprises 3 assignments, which are spread across the course of the year.\r\n\r\nTrainees will have access to an online e-portfolio system and online resources along with face to face training sessions.  These along with the excellent support from in-school mentors and tutors from Essex Teacher Training, will mean you will feel fully prepared for working in the classroom.  Your teaching load will start small and increase gradually as the year progresses.  The rate at which this increases will be decided by you and your tutors and take into account any prior experience.\r\n\r\nAssessment is via observations of you teaching, reflective pieces of writing and specific tasks relating to the different Teachers' Standards.  You will be required to teach a greater amount of maths but you will be assessed as any other Primary trainee, across all aspects of the curriculum.","interviewProcess":"You will be invited to an initial interview with Essex Teacher Training, which will include a short presentation about why you wish to teach, a written task and formal interview with a small panel of 2 people.  If successful at Phase I, you will be invited to an interview in one of our partner schools.  This interview could include: an activity with pupils eg teaching part of a lesson, or taking a group activity; a pupil panel interview and a formal interview with a small panel of representatives from the school.  If successful at Phase II, you will be given a conditional offer of a place to train.","howSchoolPlacementsWork":"Trainees will complete training in two different schools during the course of the year.  Typically trainees spend the autumn term in their host school and then go to a second placement school during the first part of the spring term and then return to their host school for the remainder of the year.  Trainees are in school 4 days a week and attend training on the 5th day. We endeavour to keep travelling time to school to a minimum so we will take into account your home address when allocating a school.  \r\n\r\nThis programme covers the primary age range 5-11. ","personalQualities":"We are looking for high quality graduates with a passion for learning who are committed to transforming the lives of young people through education.
