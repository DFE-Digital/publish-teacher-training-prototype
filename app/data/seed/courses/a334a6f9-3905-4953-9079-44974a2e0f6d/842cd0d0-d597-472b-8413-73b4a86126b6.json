Throughout the training year the amount of teaching that you take on will be gradually increased at a pace to suit you, supported at all times by in-school and academic mentoring. \r\n\r\nRunning alongside the University taught programme are a series of training days led by the Gateway Alliance, these sessions focus on key areas of practice and also provide a great opportunity for networking with other Gateway trainees.\r\n\r\nAs a salaried trainee you will be employed by your 'host school' for the duration of the course and receive a salary equivalent to point 1 of the unqualified teacher pay scale.
